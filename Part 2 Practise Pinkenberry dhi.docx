.....(10 minutes later)...
Tracey(cough,didn’t see Ash) : "Um..Misty,sorry but the routine check-up...”
Misty (smile) : "oh!hi Trace..it’s just..”
Ash(laugh) : "Mr. Playboy Ketchum here(Misty frowns at Ash).sorry if you have any resentment that i’m with my fiancee but that’s way later now how was your trip,Mr Skechit(Misty frowns at Ash)?"
Tracey(bit flustered seeing Ash) : "um..Mr. Ketchum...um..yeah great trip.Misty,i'm really so happy,but..."
Misty(frown) : "what was that Trace?and (frowning at Ash and then again at Tracey) why are are you two calling by surnames?"
Tracey(solemn) : "no i’m very happy for you Misty,very happy.i should leave,sorry to interrupt.(about to go away)"
Ash(laugh) : "Mist,he wants to inform all at once that Mr Ketchum definitely is what he is as with you again now to cheat on you(bursts into laughter).."
Misty(frown,scowl,shout) : “Ash! are you out of your mind? Trace has known..”
Ash(laugh,hugging Misty) : “Mr Ketchum for 4...use and (breaks hug) throw(burst into laughter)..”
Misty(angry,shout,standing up facing Ash) : “Ash!shut up!what..”
Tracey(scowl) : "No Misty,it’s ok,i got this calm down it’s ok(Misty frowns at Tracey).Mr Ketchum,i’m extremely sorry to interrupt your personal moment but i’m just pointing out that this isn’t your private area..”
Misty(frown) : “Trace,wha..”
Ash(solemn,stops Misty) : "please,Mist,it’s ok,he’s talking about my contract here,i got this,it’s alright.Mr Skechit i know what is private to me what isn’t,i’m only extremely sorry that i couldn’t keep my emotions checked but you see,i'm not at all bothered anymore about that.the privacy has done it’s job Mr Skechit,it’s no more needed at all and neither is what you were told,neither is that.you now can realize whether i meant it or not that day,i’m only happy for your persistence per precise perceptions Mr Skechit just that and your wife and your future..”
Tracey(flustered) : “Ash..it’s..”
Ash(getting up,standing,solemn) : “Mr. Ketchum it is and no,don’t worry,it’ll expire within 5 weeks,don’t worry...”
Misty(frown at Ash then Tracey and then again at Ash,worried,trying to make Ash,sit) : “Ash,sit down..what..”
Ash(solemn) : "it’s alright Mist,no worries. you can come later.i’m only going to my cabin,have a chat,he hasn't seen you in months and was very worried of your well-being,please be kind.."
Misty(frown at Ash and then at Tracey,standing up) : "he spent two hours with us yesterday..(frown)wait,why aren't you leaving Trace?"
Tracey(joyful) : "Ash,i got you man,i got you,4 years,man,4...you(chokes with emotion)..”
Misty(frowns at Tracey and then Ash) : “Trace,what’s wrong?Ash,why are you calling him by surname,what have you..(goes to Tracey to check him)”
Tracey(laughs,joy) : “No,Misty,it’s ok,i don’t want to disturb you two but(laugh)..you..Ash..you..(chokes in joy)..”
Ash(dragging Misty to him and hugging her very firmly,solemn) : “come on here,Mist..he’s alright it’s just a quote..don’t worry..”
Tracey(laugh) :”quote ’persistence per precise perceptions”..4 years..’if you have some perceptions about a Snorlax but the Snorlax isn’t showing it your perception should be persisted with and the rate of which shall always increase’..(beam).see you soon you f.. brat(Ash laughs,Misty all flustered)..i’ve not sweared like in 20 years Mr brat Ketchum(Ash laughs,laugh)..but you know Mr. Ashy-boy(laugh,Ash laughs)...just what to say(both laughs)..you have your flower for 19 years and i’m so happy(both smile)..but(laugh and smile)..but,you may know about a certain picture which someone had and mind the tense has(both laugh),and which is visibly adored too much(both bursts into laughter,Misty frowns at Tracey)this is gonna be far better against the shining moon with the impending one(both laugh),given her Gyarados doesn’t eat me up(both laugh)"
Misty(frowns) : “I would Trace(Ash and Tracey laughs)..hey,what is..”
Ash(laugh,hugging Misty very firmly and picking her up from ground) : "just my Mist flower!..(shout)..got your poses ya dumb fox(both bursts into laughter)...”
Misty(flustered,trying to wriggle away from Ash) : “Ash..”
Ash(covering Misty’s mouth and hugging her) : “hum?what’s the rush now Mist sweetie?(Tracey laughs)just stay. anyway,i wish i could help you Trace but you see i'm abducted..(both laugh).."
Misty(removing Ash’s palms off from her mouth and trying to break the hug and turning towards Tracey,frown) : "what's so amusing to you Trace that i'm with my fiancee..Ash..st..(Ash tries to hug Misty back,Tracey laughs)"
Ash(laugh,hugging Misty back and covering her mouth) : "(bit high pitch in Misty’s ears)don’t talk, hug firmly!(Tracey laughs,laughs to Tracey)see Trace,still screeching at both,destroying the pose,stammering the relation(both bursts into laughter)"
Misty(frown,trying to wriggle away from Ash) : "Husband...Ash,stop this..(Ash again hugs Misty back very firmly and then again picks her up from the ground)”
Tracey(going away) : "all is private now Mr Ketchum,don’t worry and congratulations Ms Waterflower Ketchum..oops,my bad!(both Ash and Tracey laughs)..."
Misty(scream,irritated) : "Trace.."
Ash(laugh) : "Mist!Mist!you’re so sweetie..(laugh)"
Misty(whinning and hugging Ash,on the ground) : "excuse,excuse,excuse,even outside the
Gym,what kind of boneheads feed Hoot-Hoots in the night,you were right
Ash,on one account only that we should've been home but you're Pokemons only
are here for too much food nothing else(Ash bursts into laughter)these little brats aren't
even going to allow me a solitary moment with my husband(smile and
hugging Ash more firmly),well he's right about that one(giggling at Ash)"
Ash(smile) : "i would hate to say it Mist,but now you should be the one to release me from your arms otherwise it'll be delayed..(both laugh).."
Misty(smile,hugging Ash very firmly) : "i wont..and(hugging Ash’s necks)..hum,Ashy-Boy,a stone is still important then,isn't it?or is it Morality?(both laugh)..."
Ash(smile and hug): "all the above only Mistyviously(giggle and Misty smirks),but i guess what treatment poor Tracey Gets or i get,i even related Professor Oak of all people with certain people..really i need your help on this Mist"
Misty(bit dissaointed) : "No Ash,you've gone too far,anyhow don't bother you have a
team(smile,hugging Ash firmly)"
Ash(smile,and hugging Misty very firmly) : "and my eternally sweet Mist teammate,much Appreciated(both giggle),by-the-way what are your demands now i mean i owe you big time now with my position and so on.."
Misty(smile) : "You know what i want Ash.."
Ash(smile) : "Ah,Mist,that's like a part of the body,you tell me about dates,dances,lakes and so on whatever i told you..second date that is(both bursts into laughter)..,just want peace and quite with you ALONE(both laugh),i've to tell you so many things in details,it'll take years..”
Misty(smile) : "why don't you start with going back to the Hall of Fame Book?"
Ash(irritated) : "not that again.."
Misty(tendering Ash’s cheeks) : "Ash there's been a few Gym leaders who turned down,because of the nasty regulations but i've never heard about any trainers doing this..its a fair thing you know, don't create a mess there if you get what what i mean"
Ash(smile) : "your wish sweetie.but(whinning) i'll still trash talk them unless they stop speculating about my sweet flower’s entry there and lessen the pressure from upon her-my sweet sweet Mist flower will be beaming and bouncing all the time(hugs Misty very firmly,Misty smiles at Ash tendering his cheeks)..."
Misty(smile,tendering Ash’s cheeks and head) : "Ash let them take their time, don't mingle in those official matters dear, you've already become too rough for you sweetness,very harsh and things have indeed taken it's huge toll in you too.why don't you forget about this farm and all that and come with me take a rest in the Gym?"
Ash(grim face) : "and you'll leave me from 9-6:30 for gym battles for godforsaken brats.."
Misty(laugh) : "remembering yourself?"
Ash(scowl) : "hey i was never brat.."
Misty(bursts into laughter) : "still wanna fight Mist?"
Ash(smile) : "soully and all the time."
(both hug for a few moments smiling)
Misty(bit concerned) : "anyhow Ash,you seriously need rest.."
Ash(hugging Misty back) : "Orange with my wife and nowhere else,in a rather secluded island-3 months would do Mist,right?"
Misty(smile) : "1 week would barely-that much for a double facility hall of fame gym no matter
what Lance says given i'm only holidaying and that too after this one"
Ash(smile,hugging Misty very firmly) : "and i being who i’m now with all behind me can’t serve my hall of fame wife for 3 more by forcing them to extend it?"
Misty(smile,tendering Ash’s cheeks) : “ i want that to extend upto eternity Ash(hugging Ash very firmly smiling at him,Ash also smiles at Misty hugging her very firmly,then they both hug each other very firmly,few moments later) but(laugh) why don’t we do it inside the gym keeping it shut down(both laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “then they will say young flower dream has become old scowling wife”
(both bursts into laughter and keeps hugging each other for a few more moments)
Misty(smile) : "just a thing,Ash did you know that once i had developed some feelings
for Gary and had a skirmish with Lil on this as well or just a wild guess?"
Ash(solemn,hugging Misty very firmly) : "Mist,i've caused you so much
pain sweetie,but (smiles at Misty) let me runaway with you right now dear,inside my soul(both smile at each other,Misty also hugs Ash very firmly)"
Misty(smile,hugging Ash very firmly) : "Ash we have each other forever to runaway with,soully(both smiles at each other then keeps hugging each other for a few moments)..but..um..Ash,it's just that's not mentioned anywhere,none except Lil and i know,thus.."
Ash(laugh,same pose) : " now see the actual side that were laughig at you cause first you had to call my home to know my whereabouts by calling my mom as mom(laugh,Misty smiles)..16 year habit and the eventual(smiles at Misty,Misty smiles at Ash and hugs him very firmly,same pose)...Gary was after Lillie since their first match here 19 long years ago(laugh) and finally Lillie was much inspired by your sweetness and yet firmness and longing for me so finally her fear that her inner sweet girl nature if people see will hurt her too much was gone and thus that outer cover of frivolity too and that cover came cause never had the right guidence like Daisy and nothing else,Sarah and Brauch just were too affectionate to all of you and thus couldn’t say anything cause all of your natures are once trust that is like own family and and even more so they knew that didn’t want to break that off as if that sweet core of all of you are hurt you all become headless and this is just the reflection of that devastation nothing else and all you were doing were to express your talents nothing else brats ferry around brats no big deal and you all knew it yourselves most and so they weren’t bothered either and your sisters are as good as you are took that brunt a bit more than you being elders that’s all and hence you were protected as well Lillie’s attitude you know all just couldn’t express how much she loves everyone infact in the general way so sweet she is just the fear during those confusing years that she might be cheated upon that real nature of her did the frivolity mask came around and with Gary went away he the same in reverse way,never stable in personal life cause he needed Lillie and that support and all rest about all of you that aren’t you is all illusion meaningless and unreal and your confusion was ever that once my Ash is not fondling me enough why is he not he should and never could think as he’s not then i should and that’s cause i’m not different to you that’s why only my Ash and my Ash does whatever i want he’s just my Ash and that’s why for no why at all you’re my Mist similarly(smiles at Misty,Misty too smiles at Ash same pose both) and Mist dear you don’t know anything except me and that was your trouble all the time since that very first day and thus all those girls and all you were so inconvenient about i know now Mist it’s just that official confirmation that i’m you you wanted from my mouth cause those didn’t come to you neither me then sweetie words are disturbing aren’t they between me and me(smiles at Misty,Misty smiles same pose) and about them whatever was there you then and there realized your mistake which wasn’t a mistake as i said all just my Ash for you that’s all and it was 2 long years ago probably i guess about in May or even June,Gary confessed then and they and Daisy and Trace once confessed won’t take more than 2/3 to confirm and marry and it did happen Gary and Lillie got engaged in August and Trace and Daisy in May next year after confession in April,that jackal wasted 2 years(laugh) and you infact helped Lillie pushing her to the edge cause both were waiting for the other to respond as was the other two sisters and all and two men like Trace and Gary was there so devoted for 10 or more years surely i’m not blind Mist you know that the since beginning and Brock we both do know inside out and Violet the same as any Mantine is straight and too sweet so just forget the illusion we’re more than any family now but how exactly i know that illusion in detailed psychic games will take ages to tell you but none at my first night with me sweet wife hum...(Misty smiles at Ash hugging Ash very firmly,Ash too smiles and hugging Misty firmly they stay so for a few moments) lets go then sweetie.."
Misty(smiling and stroking Ash's cheeks) : "yes dear,just let's go."
.......(in the lab,9:35)......
Gary,Lillie,Daisy,Professor Oak,Delia Ketchum,Tracey)
Ash(from far,didn’t see Delia) : "this looks sinister captain,sorry for the wrong turn"
Misty(smiling) : "bother not crew,captain to rescue(both smile)"
...
Delia(grave) : "Ash,we need to talk"
Ash(pleading) : "Mom,not in front of Mist.."
Delia(shout) : "What did you tell Professor Oak and all?"
Ash(bit dissapointed) : ".um,just a sec,(whisper to Misty.."Mist,you better leave manage your sisters later not now Mist,please,i’ll lose it again if they drag you..(Misty frowns at Ash and doesn’t budge),mom please look i've just married Mist so...”
Lillie(scearm,cries,hugs Misty) : “married?huh?!?..what do mean you..(chokes)..”
Ash(solemn) : “i didn’t have any rings with me so can’t show you that right now anyway,why don't i deal with the venerable ones later,except(solemnly) Professor Oak,if only i ever could be given the opportunity,i know i'm unworthy of given what i said,but do i have any chance of rescuing the relationship?"
Professor Oak(grave)-"Ash you did go too far you see in my all 58 years here never have i been this much insulted that too from a person i've been so fond of and that too infront of my grandson and family"
Ash(solemnly) : "Alright,I told Mist what i said to you all,Mom please,you don't have to listen to them take Misty with you"
Daisy(trying to take Misty away) : "she's not going anywhere Ketchum,leave our sister alone.."
Lillie(scream,cries,tries to take Misty away as well) : “and she’ll never be yours..you..(chokes)..”
Misty(trying to force her sisters off,Gary and Tracey tackles them): "Dase,Lil..please,it’s.."
Ash(grabs Misty away,sternly,grave voice) : "Mist just go back to the pokemons and Mom please
follow her,please i beg of you"(Misty and Delia leaves)...right i hereby tell you and here’s the proof Trace please(hands Tracey a prescription copy)...Mist was using some substances to forget me and consequently was and isn’t well at all...atleast let her be with me today to get the level of those substances down cause she has had about 3 medicines and 1 injection already and another for next 7 days with other formalities and then from tomorrow you can start your legal procedures and those only affcet the mind thus you won’t see any otside changes and you didn’t at the get togethger except that she looks skinny and pale these kills one’s sanity and that Trace,is the exact reason why i did what i did but if any of you thinks i don’t care about her it’s not my problem at all but that was needed to be done cause she won’t tell anyone else and you can’t stop her as you know her nature the day Daisy left went to the next steps...right,so i began with Gary today,mate i'm sorry and just that.Lillie if you ever can please consider me same to you Daisy,i was totally out of my mind that moment but if you ever find it possible have a consideration and you too Trace,i'm sorry.I just became insane.I don't defend myself but if you ever could please consider me,and aslo for marrying your sister as well if you could,don't worry she won't run back anywhere or stagnate or get addictions like she did,this much assured and if she wants she can still be Cerulian Gym Leader i've no problems with that.and yes she has come to me on her own wish only and yet if you want legal procedures tell me i myself will leave her and admit it in press,no need to strain yourselves and Professor Oak,um..i did cross the line but i guess you being you may understand i wasn't having the best of times of my life and was about to go to a situation which either would've propelled me to
heaven or throw me to hell,i was not quite in myself..i don't have to tell you much,and i won’t ask for anything from you of all.My contract here finishes 5 weeks later,i’ll try to shift my bunch my before but you understand best it’ll take time but not more than 2 months so untill then please bear with me atleast.you won't see me again here around the Lab but please if you ever consider i'll just run in here like i used to when i just about could run.I'm sorry again and please,all of you if you can spare a thought for me.right everybody again my apologies and sorry,but if you consider then spare me a thought but also you see that i'm now with my Mist for atleast the rest of today,so you've helped still,thanks"(leaves towards Pokemons)

Misty(concerned) : "What happened Ash?"
Ash(solemn,angry,very stern) : “you,mom Dragonite and Talonflame me Giratina and Ultranercozma...Gengleye come at my home with two pokeballs for Giti and Cozy and another for Talon and take Greninja with you in a pokeball,Dragu return after mom alights at home safely and Mist too and take Glalie with you when you return..
Delia(frown): "Ash!wait don't drag.."
Misty(hugs Ash firmly,little tears,concerned) : “Ash..”
Ash(concerned,hugging Misty firmly,wiping off Misty’s tears) : "Mom i've got your daughter back,isn't that enough,please comply,please,you can come back through the Lab all you life,just not today Mom,please..and Mist it’s ok not the time for emotions..”
Professor Oak(grave): "Ash! Just a sec,your mom won't be troubled at all,neither would Misty,for them this is ever the same and ever will be.you too for tonight.
Ash(solemn) : "Um..thanks,Professor..Dragu take Cozy in a ball and take Glalie back on the way here,Talon go there with Dragu,Giti come along with me,Gengleye do as i told"
(all of them finally reached home)
.....(night,11,just after reaching home)...
(Misty's Phone rings,Violet,shows Ash)
Ash(laugh) : "the lawyers are here already..(bursts into laughter).."
Misty(frown) : "Ash!i'll handle it,get things ready..
Ash(murmur) : "yeah open the f.. phone and..."
Violet(almost crying) : "Mist,what?where are you?why.."
Misty (solemn) : "Viol,we've patched up,where are you now?"
Violet(screem,tears) : "that b.. will.."
Misty(solemn) : "Viol you're tired now just go home,Brock will be expecting

Misty(solemn) : "Viol,Ash didn’t force or threaten me it’s totally my choice.we are getting engaged very soon and i'm ever happy only with him..just keep yourself safe and return safely,let Brock call once you’ve reached home and settled down"
Violet(sobbing) : "the b.. told Lil.."

Violet(sobbing) : "just stay safe Mist..i'll call so will Brock.."
Misty(solemn) : "yeah,keep safe,will connect soon"
Ash(laugh) : "that b.. will kill you.."
Misty(hugging Ash,solemn) : "Ash,please,anger and dissent create more of that only..please,calm down we'll talk it out more than family remember?don't bother.."
Ash(solemn) : "yeah family for sure first night and.."
Misty(solemn) : "you were too harsh to them you know.."
Ash(scoff, shivering voice) : "i'm sorry Mist,but let them do whatever they can
i'm packing up in 5 weeks from the Lab(Misty sighs,hugging Misty very firmly)..i was the one who told Trace to keep up,he found Daisy,told Gary not to mingle with me and your personal problems got Lillie,sweared Brock off out of his infatuation with wrong reports and then he got Violet..and all i got were a few f.. b.. who had the audacity to challenge a 6 time champ prizing his integrity to his bunch for a..my Mist,my sweet Mist flower to them was..."
Misty(hugging Ash,tears,stern Voice,shiver) : "hey,you’ve your Mist right here and wanna make her cry on.."
Ash(solemn,hugging Misty) : "it's alright Mist,i'll talk,sorry for emotions but don’t bother about those f..”
Misty(frown) : "Ash they're our family.we can't stay like this forever"
Ash(irritated) : Had mom not been there you could've spoken,who told my mom.."
Misty(solemn) : "whoever Ash, doesn't matter you should go there now.."
Ash(solemn) : "Ah! first night together after so many years and..”
Misty(frown) : "Ash!"
Ash(solemn) : "All right Mist,you have a nice sleep ok(hugging Misty)"(Giratina,Ultranercozma,Gengar and Sableye comes with Talonflame in a ball and Greninja in a ball)"Chu stay,Sableye stay with Mist..Chu introduce your buddies to Mist your Pikachupi,Gengar follow comrade and Greninja,Talonflame,Cozy and Giratina comes with me..Mist,keep stay safe Gengleye i call the duo like Crawdauntogator my rocket friends Gengleye knows everything like rest 104,Chu will do the introductions and don’t worry about me you’ve seen my bunch and for the name Giratina and Ultranercozma you know.."
Misty(solemn) : "you can stay out all night,i'm going tomorrow at 9,i want to see smiles,got me Ash?"

...(back at Lab)...
Daisy at first...
Daisy(frown) : "why are you back Ketchum"
Ash(solemn) : "Daisy,please would you care to let me speak?"
Daisy(scowl) : "go on but it’s 12:40"
Ash(solemn) : "um..just was getting the memories refreshed..sorry..but,i'm here to know whether you're alright with Mist's choice?"
Daisy(scowl): "that's why you came? Ketchum..you.."
Ash(grave) : "your past is past Daisy,all illusion unreal,that you know i know that extremely well and besides neither you nor Lillie nor Violet were ever not what they're shown to
be,Daisy please,i know your bunch too well and then your care for my bunch despite me is proof enough.. "
Daisy(solemn) : "Ketchum,in front of everyone you.."
Ash(bit agitated) : "alright may i speak then since Mist would tell you anyway.."
Daisy(solemn) : "yeah that's what i want too,spit it out,why are you with my baby Mist
and what did you mean with my..(tears)"
Ash(concerned) : "Calm down Daisy,i needed to know the truth"
Daisy(sobbing,wipes tears off) : "what do you mean?Ans.."
Ash(concerned) : "i'm answering,just stay calm.i can't stay separated from Mist and
neither can she,so we're back and just the formality left to say we’re married,as long as you and
Trace,hey why don't you call him here as well?"
Daisy(solemn) : "he won't till i'm satisfied"
Ash(concerned) : "Daisy,you know well of my position now..my sources gave me the news last morning of coming parenthood for you two,i couldn't have been happier and besides your my sister in law by both sides,you know i didn't mean those,or if you doubt,please forgive me but i'm
honest i really wasn't right then..."
Daisy(solemn) : "what was the truth?"
Ash(bit agitated) : "umm...Daisy please Mist will tell.."
Daisy(scream) : "i want it from you."
Ash(sigh) : "Alright,calm down..please..i’m saying..please calm down..i had to know how much Mist can bear with me,upto which level,and you can see the result,can you please let it go?"
Daisy(angry,shivering voice,tears) : "you threatened her to be with you and your bragging,Ketchum?you b.."
Ash(sigh) : "Daisy,do you like Trace as much as you do with someone else?"
Daisy(shout,tears) : "you b..,what are you pointing.."
Ash(solemn) : "you'll remain with Tracey as long and as much Mist did to me,you will
walk with him all the way."
Daisy(sobbing) : "do you doubt that Ketchum?"
Ash(sigh) : "not in 3 times never but if you weren't sure whether he will as well what would you do?"
Daisy(scowl,sobbing,tears) : "Ketchum,you're crossing.."
Ash(solemn) : "exactly my point,you'll see how much he can bear with you,i did the
same with Mist,if i'm lying shoot me later,i'll be happy,now please,go it's pretty
late.."
Daisy(sobbing) : “Ketchum,Trace told me about that prescription you gave,my baby..(crying and sobbing)..”
Ash(solemn) : “that’s my point,whether you all like me or not she’s not getting healed by any other means..”
(Tracey comes out,shivering)
Tracey(shivering voice) : "Ash,i..."
Ash(solemn) : "Trace,please,my head wasn't at the right place for 4 years and today was the climax.."
Daisy(frown,shivering) : "he has explained himself to me Trace, let's leave him,Ketchum you
return home ok, don't cheat on her the very first night saying you stayed here for too long,’night,come on Trace"
(Tracey and Daisy Leave)
Ash(self) : "one down two to go,Giti"
...(Gary)
Gary(solemn) : "Ash! you know who i was,you've just gone lower!"
Ash(solemn) : "who i was? Gary that was till you were 17 and all of that was just childishness as if only beacuse of that you have to always mention it and that incident didn’t involve one iota of your wish ever just who you are now is who you were even then and that’s the end of it and (mild) why Gary,because i said at that juncture of my life something to you and Lillie in madness and you were pretty confident I won't cheat on Misty even yesterday?"
Gary(solemn) : "Ash, you’re only harming youself you see,your head has spun with all
these,i would've not minded at all had you ot brought up that shared child
thing..you know i told you first.."
Ash(solemn) : "exactly Gary, you've been my closest and the only link with my childhood and all in these 4 years,but to be honest with you,you see,you'll go with Lillie to the end and viseversa but you'll be with me just till that moment,and still you're talking with me is proof enough that what
priceless jewel Lillie has.."
Gary(hugging Ash,smile) : "sorry i doubted you that moment buddy i get you,just that pain not having your eternal wife,Misty is
special to you and you needed the assurance,i get you,and i surely know that
in these many years how special she is, don't make her cry again,ok?"
Ash(hugging Gary) : "yes thanks buddy,no she won't cry but(laugh)..man Gary,you have walked as far well,Mist just my wife eternally hence the stagnation was most and you my twin bro forever eternally hence this(laugh)..she was given chances man innumerable only then did she become able to express her core and how many you or Trace or Brock got absolutely none,don’t bother man i know all three are more than just my bros it’s special man,i can’t..”
Gary(same pose,smile) : “don’t bother Ash,it’s ok,the very secrect core shouldn’t be spoken(both smile and pat each other and then break the hug)..”
Ash(smile) : “and special are all of you-Lillie,Daisy,Violet all of them as well Gary,first her bunch then my bunch is enough proof of also who Lillie is and has ever been thanks for being patient with me.."
Gary(bit dejected) : “yeah,it’s ok,Lil's inside,still can't get over what you said..just go and meet..”
Ash(solemn) : "she'll be fine,i promise buddy"
(Inside)
Lillie(crying,scream) : "you b.."
Ash(solemn) : "Please Lillie,don't torture the little one,i know what you are to Gary and
viseversa, don't bother about a bonehead like me in his maddest moment,please stay calm,please"
Lillie(sobbing) : "you left Mist in a place i wish i could throw you in right now,i've never
been hurting inside like today due to you Ketchum and you had to bring up the
darkest day of my life.."
Ash(solemn) : "that day accelerated your travel to your soul a double negetive but (mild) please Lillie,it was a moment of madness,i know how Gary has been since he left for Johto 17 years back and it’s been 13 years that you’re seeing him and what you two mean to each other since he was 15..please i'm happy for both of you and the future..."
Lillie(sobbing) : "enough Ketchum,enough of that...who told you about that...(crying)..and...i doubt you Ketchum,whether you truely want Mist or not..she couldn't see any light the day you left her for road.. s.."
Ash(solemn) : "and in the darkness of unbearable confusion she was suddenly encroaching the one she helped most to show her inner nature without any hesitation,yes please Lillie,Mist told me,please it's long past forget that i ever said it.."
Lillie(crying) : "so you know...(sobbing)..you've trodden the very core of my life,Gary,i can't be.."
Ash(straight) : "you two are soulmates never else and that’s enough..and(mild) no,you don't have to be without your soulmate,ever,but unless you calm down,the whole family’s future will only stress Gary,please i beg of you,calm down,take rest.."
Lillie(sobbing) : "what assurance have you given Mist..you..and don’t dare to nickname her..."
Ash(straight) : "well then i would say my wife has me for assurance...”
Lillie(sobbing) : “don’t try to be clever Ketchum,you know more than anyone...(sobbing)..have you spoken to Dase?.."
Ash(solemn) : “yes i have..but(mild) plesase calm down..”
Lillie(sobbing) : "you also hurt grandpa like.."
Ash(solemn) : "i'm going now,Daisy didn't allow me then so have to sneak in..but please
you please don't jeopardize the future because of me,it doesn't serve any
purpose,please Lillie,your my Sister in law as well, don't do this,i beg of you from
the whole family's point of view,you'll have the eldest and first..please none else but mercy Gary and your future..please"
Lillie(sobbing) : "get out Ketchum and i’m never your relation or will be just leave.."
Ash(solemn) : "yes i’m leaving but i promised Gary you'll be fine after i leave, don't let him
down,best wishes.."
...(outside)..
Ash(dissapointed) : "sorry buddy,but i guess she's a bit better now,just attend her"
Gary(concerned) : "yeah i’ll handle her,but Ash,that prescription Trace barely could say much except that it’s ().."
Ash(solemn) : 4+ months,Gary you know me i’m a b.. and that’s why i could accuse you of all for not confronting Lillie that day cause you were the one may be on that very moment itself told me about the future..as soon as Daisy left,Mist being Mist went a step further and you understand the rest,i broke into her room as you know then saw those and even then she was intoxicated to a lesser degree took a sleep powder you know those you at party would never recognize and all to use Goldy and Starmie and then Jellicent just the idea of forgetting me which you know would be the one remaining the rest goes with sanity leaving her mad in the streets asking people if they were me by the end of this year would’ve been closer you know the intelligence that one would show and also if that one thought if automatically goes how quickly it can heal...keep that prescription you or Trace,half to Kukui and if they don’t want her to be with me..”
Gary(hugging and patting Ash) : “it’s alright buddy,it’s alright..’unnesseciate the necessary if the necessity is subtle enough’..your words Ash,don’t worry i realize what you were upto and how honest you were as usual...and about your legal procedures and bunch shifting,i’m here you don’t need to worry about any of that..and don’t kill yourself to just see whether Misty too follows others or you as you if not before but now surely know the result..Ash,all will be fine but i’ve just one problem if any..Grandpa..”
Ash(hugging Gary) : "i'm going pal..but just..(breaking the hug)..”
Gary(smile) : “go on”
Ash(dissapoined) : “you surely know why my bunch is at this situation and why they are with me and if i ever have been what i should be to them but you know what my psychic bunch can do and i’m sure with my matches you might guess but to be honest i did by Unown and Musharna agitated you one day and Meowstic made sure Lillie doesn’t wake up and Celebi and Bronzong was hallucinating the whole lab to protect me,Gardevoir was making sure that Lillie is getting as much comfort and protection as needeed happens by that fairy softness and you know the rest and Reuniclas hid me from the rest of the world and Deoxys got me in with Uxie doing it for you while Unown and Musharna looked after you and Beeheeyem for me,wanted to know the news that i heard about what i told Professor if you know and then Gary i did the worse i went further and queried what you think of Lillie that is like just as if any two random sample comes together and then goes off or like soulmates very special and that was done by gruelling you on flesh and blood and the physical beauty and mental virtues like good human qualities all this is to make sure you truely do want her and she didn’t foist her upon you and may be you have hesitation still i knew Lillie’s status as a star and all that she faced like Mist herself did but Lillie’s nature is too sweet as i get it that outside is only to hide that in the apprehension that people may hurt her inside like that same situation as you were in personal disaster then that talent and thus the rest and i was suspicious still i knew the environment created at Cerulian and all about it and what will happen if i break off like i did and thus i never knew if my words to you had kinda alerted you or not as to what i meant i did mean carry on your work and if it’s really Lillie then just be that and be beside her and then you all were relieved and then after you Trace was gruelled in similar manner to make sure of similar things and then i got Lillie one day that was extremely hard but Gary believe me i knew what i was doing i’ve gone to my Heatran’s own home after getting her all by herself came for 2 days and Musharna was there for reviewing the process when my Heatran connected me to her pals at her home and i passed in certain timespans including breaks 2.5 hours with them in that psychic subtle stuff just to tell them i’m not cheating on their buddy who chose me and thus i know this was repeated with all 9 there at Kalos and thus i got Lillie when Grumpig,Unown hosted her,Uxie and Beeheeyem communicated for her,Musharna,Meowstic,Reuniclas made sure the future gets max protection in psychic channels when mom is in subtle state that her connection with him isn’t disturbed at all yeah my nephew mom said recalled the human form just (smiles at Gary,Gary smiles) and Gardevoir was there to give Lillie that comfort and i was hosted by Bronzong and communicated by Deoxys and Magearna hid me while Celebi made your sleep sound,both occasions were inside your room they know how to open and close doors cause i first went in there with subtle body and showed them how to open it you know them 6/7 trials enough and no none would wake up and outside on any occasion had max protection i had Dusknoir on Trace and Daisy,Confragigus on Professor and the rest staffs and guards and all had Gengar,Gourgeist,Sableye,Mismagius,Marshadow,Banette,Hoopa,Darkrai,Malamar,Aegislash,Glalie,Jellicent,Spiritomb,Giratina,Ultranercozma,Latios,Hydreigon,Yveltal,Metagross,Chanedlure,Rotom and Noivern and the whole lab no human or pokemon could penetrate and any calls or else was taken care of cause none would receive and my mom was dozed off by Mime and Chu was in the room with Togedemaru and Lillie’s side similar to you i wanted to know and all and her realtions with Mist she was much influenced by her and then that situation due to me and all was ok the few brat names i know as well but no as much as you know about them me same nothing was hidden from you as you know and same as your case same stuff her situation was easy the query was just on her son is she happy now with given all just like an interview with a former star now no more active and the implications did the honesty part and you know subtle body anyway that is there and all and to be honest with you it’s just all because of the all sorts of apprehensions i’ve ever heard gripped me and infact you know Melody Sanders for sure i had ever much contact with her similar sort of attitude once went off the grid a brat cheated on her had to remove evidences and that devastated her now though very happy married double Kanto,now Levender psychic specialist, John Harrison actually childhood friends at Safforn that stuff and Melody i ever recall cause 12 years after that had connection ever wanted me may be as a travel companion after Johto was insecured with her personal life i guess wanted me as a big bro in a way like May was so fortunate to have at Hoenn and same stuff barring her skills,May as you know needed her brig bros at first journey but in case of Melody i never bothered to remove the professional mask and even that was so much for her feel bad just that and Lillie’s case kinda similar but Melody was spoiled once stepped foot in Kalos which the Cerulian brats reminded me of on that gym challenge day anyway,all psychic stuffs subconscious wanted to know those as i said and also if she knows news that i heard about what i told Professor if you and Lillie both know and then Daisy was interrogated similarly and no nothing went out of family wouldn’t have had as told you full ghost psychic gang around whole lab to create the invisible mixed cover and you and Trace had extra cover with two psychic at the doorstep of your room no human sane and alive could eavesdrop us passing through the walls and same as well today all in family noting went out for similar reason and today even if Trace came back would’nt have been allowed in that room still Marshadow was there for exactly that reason at the doorstep today and all cause this idea gripped me that i must get rid of everyone barring mom to see if Mist really is my soulmate or just like a random sample from the mass by luck came by luck went so it’s just that if..”
Gary(smile) : “Ash,don’t bother i surely know how attached your bunch is to you and the few names you just mentioned if not all and the methods you’re talking about is enough for us to know why they are so much attached to you and why the name Giratina of all dragons behaves like an irritating 7 year old kid with me for 2 years now with a Zeraora being added for another which name is no less a deal either(laugh,Ash faintly smile) it’s ok man you couldn’t say a word back to all when we sweared you and all those in those days ever saying useless to skirmish and that has stayed surely you are honest enough to be what you are to your bunch and your Misty as well 4 years all these i surely get it what was happening inside you and you know best Misty’s position,just enjoy the rest with her and us and all and no nothing is wrong with Lillie i know pokemons bro and hence i know what protection she had from the whole outside and nothing happened to your nephew either all fine just welcome back to family Ash and congratulations for marrying your 19 year long wife once more(laugh,Ash faintly smile)..”
Ash(faint smile) : “thanks pal,but no i won’t eavesdrop anyone again using my bunch and no all of Mist’s sisters are mine as much as well ever has been but it’s just that idea and illusion that gripped me i just had to be sure of my knowledge i’ve my Mist again and that’s all for me but also just that to confirm your belief is the fact that Kingler is here for longest you know full well that they can work independent of me completely so they will suddenly...”
Gary(smile,hugging Ash,patting his back,Ash too hugs Gary) : “i’m Muk’s own bro and that’s your answer pal,just have a chat with grandpa won’t be sleeping otherwise,and run back to your flower and also let me go to my flower now(laugh,Ash smiles and they hug and pat each other)...”
Ash(smile) : “yeah thanks man,see you morning if i can(both laugh)..just that Unovan b.. got upto my nerves(both laugh)..and the reason so far still your flower hasn’t disturbed us with this long suspicious talk is now here and was connected by me through psychic channels i directed to stay at Lillie and make sure she is in a dizzy state to even want to get out of the room plese welcome out of invisibility my sweet little Giti...(both laugh again,Giratina becomes visible and pesters both a bit both laugh again)..just my Giti(both laugh and then Ash leaves on Giratina)..”
......(zap into Professor Oak's room)
Ash(solemn) : "Professor!"
Oak(solemn) : "Ash! see i wouldn't mind but the children..."
Ash(solemn,dissapointed) : "Professor i've got nothing to hide from you,i dug a grave for myself which contained only me to see if Mist jumps in that to accompany me or stays back with everyone else and hence the self created lunatic severity..Professor you know perfectly well her attitude towards me since she first saw me for absolutely no reason and no matter what she attained professionally later that attitude only increased by manifolds with each passing month i wasn’t there with her but in Unova a certain incident happened and subsequently that attitude just busted and i couldn’t control that cause that same attitude then seemed to me as exactly why i was subject to that very incident and thus the rift and thus my endeavours to publicly hunt down all future possibilities of the recurrence of that attitude to me and you know well that another such pushed me to lunacy with this endeavour of mine coupled with the requirements of being the master of 107 till i realized before going literally mad joining in the joy of the same but only 107 who are true to me to that grave i spoke of why not another time till i’m in the human emotions have the last test to confirm my very basic premise and thus... "
Oak(smile) : "enough Ash!enough!enough explanation son,and just forget that we ever had this bit of a problem.."
Ash(dejected) : "have you forgiven me Professor?"
Oak(smile) : "Ash,i've seen your great-great Grandpa for 2 years or so and don’t remember anything else including his features but must’ve rode on his shoulders then cause(laugh)..i was below 5 as well and you know the rest just as you did with me,you're same as all in your family and mostly your dad..ever desperate,ever natural ever the Ketchum's,and the Ketchum's and Oak's share a huge history,which you surely don't know in full though you mentioned but i'll tell you later in details.."
Ash(solemn) : "Thanks Professor,but.."
Oak(hugging Ash,smile) : "it's alright son,and You've made your choice,i know
all the four of those sweet little flowers from Cerulian Gym very very well,i'm so glad you've picked up the one for you,be happy young man,enjoy!"
Ash(smile)  : "thanks Again Professor."
Professor Oak(curious) : "umm..Ash,just one thing for clarification only,if you allow
me.."
Ash(faint smile,dissapointed) : "Professor,please if you want my permission i’ll find no solace..."
Professor Oak(smile) : "um..no Ash,just out of curiosity.."
Ash(faint smile) : "ask whatever you want Professor,you'll get the right answer according
to my knowledge.."
Professor Oak(bit concerned) : "thanks,Ash i know you were trash talking there but the
student and the staffs, it's true that once I was involved with one of my students rather just apprentice just around the time your grandma' came to my life and i also wasn't sure like you.."
Ash(dissapointed,solemn) : "Professor I can't forgive myself if you keep hovering over long gone
matters like this..it was 58 years ago and was all about only 5 months only 2 other people were involved except grandma and all came to agreement and still worked together exactly here for the next 4 years...please Professor,the whole world knows who you are not matter what some are preaching now in their abject delusion and if an egotistical so and so like me.."
Professor Oak(solemn) : "no,Ash it’s alright.i have buried that exactly those many years ago and as you said it was buried by all then and there including your grandma,but Ash
that's my point,i know that the psychics can but still to the point how did you know the names.."
Ash(grave) : "Professor the psychic part as you said you know is more than me i know that but there’s more to me i don’t know how i can react so well to them infact you know my started bossed me around cause i was his little bro and still does even more but differently now so not around me whole time and you know the whole bunch does thus their condition they take me as themselves i don’t know what they mean by that or their antics and words like i never know about Muk himself and you know more about all but what you may not know cause you haven’t see him for a long time is just that Charizard’s current evolution you know highest level X mega and on him with my dragons and ghosts it’s a matter of all sorts of subtle bodies and thus the travels at impossibly high pace which will allow me in 14 hours to travel from here back to here around the world if they can thus once i heard the newses and you know i’m in demand now each moment cause people can’t control their legendary greed so i have informations and once i was hellbent on creating that hell i travelled at that pace and used all subtle bodies to enter all places and conditions to push all people hallucinating the rest of the world out and even may be channelizing myself into them as much as my bunch can push me and then using my own stuffs to push them in dreams in other situatins and so on when they are or if not making them so the vulnerability and all to extract all specific informations upto names if they remember that and i can do a little bit without my bunch as well but that’s just if my subject on own is honest a word that with me may be...”
Professor Oak(smile) : "Ash,enough,i know about the honesty part in you.."
Ash(firmly) : "um..sorry but please allow me professor...(frimly),due to me there won't be any black
shadows over anyone,the Source was Professor Kirk himself,and as i actually got him
may be a month before he died.."
Professor Oak(solemn) : "i see.."
Ash(solemn) : "wasn’t in good health but at home went there one day with Gengar,Sableye,Confragigus,Dusknoir,Aegislash,Mismagius,Banette,Marshadow,Spiritomb,Darkrai,Chaneldure,Glalie,Jellicent,Gourgeist and Hoopa i had Banette to host me and Spiritomb linked me,he had Malamar and Confragigus to host him,Hoopa and Dusknoir to look after him and Sableye did the internal linking,Marshadow and Darkrai hid us completely and i had Gengar still as a backup for professor’s safe passage and Jellicent was there for my safe return purpose
and then Chanedlure was there still just outside the room door to give the outer layer of protection by means of hallucinating everyone off if they came around and still had Glalie,Gourgeist and Aegislash roaming around the house to catch any movement and then to doze them off by disturbing them on the then i still had Decidueye in my room itself if still even any subtle body or so comes aroud she will take care of them while Jellicent was linking with outside and our condition and then i forced some of my questions and the ghosts made him uneasy inside his head to compell speak the truth..i also left a note detailing my actions and reasons as much as i thought was right without any particular mentions of name or place or time or methods or anything like that..his son contacted me after his death,he came to agreement with this fact and didn't have any resentment for me rather was happy that before his time here this term was up i rather helped him to be all happy in the last moment as well if he ever had a problem with it to begin with that is...that's all that i have as an atonement and you know it’s just 2/3 weeks back i went just after my last match with Lance..you know my level the best and what they can do..a numbered few among their spesis have ever come up to the level that they're at or may be they’re themselves the new benchmarks..and i suspect they are getting better every moment and you know they can't breed due to their heightened powers,and i don't know why but they just don't bother and take me as they themselves and won’t leave my side by any means despite my own actions to them,all of my bunch has given their lives for me and just so happy and content with this fact and you know Butterfree and this his 3 generation or so..stays here after being 1 month with me a bug type gave up that power to heighten intelligence and Ribombee and Butterfree can’t be compared we all know in this respect,Pidgeot all by himself returned here though yeah he used to but now permanent and same breeding gave up and you know those who do similar intelligence as if they didn’t and Squirtle and Charizard even doesn’t stay here all time..(grim)..Professor i'm sorry if i’ve cheated upon their trust but i was.."
Professor Oak(patting Ash,smile) : "Ash i know your bunch,what powers they pocess,it’s equal to that of the very highest legends known and that too if they are trained and not in wild,they're pokemons yet they show such strange and heightened intelligence,i know their sacrifices and mostly i get ashtonished by their carefree nature and joy that you’re beside them only that is enough for them..Ash,i know pokemons,unless the trainer is extremely honest with himself they won’t show this character ever and(laugh) only 5 among 107 can breed and do still till may be they decide otherwise(laugh) and a many has given up after once or twice and all that total robots with hearts of true friends hard to find such 107 humans if not impossible in general(smiles at Ash,Ash smiles faintly)....they are a once only bunch just like their trainer..but now you're opening up,i am being rude to you now but now you can understand my own curiosity more..so"
Ash(boad smile) : "Thanks professor and please,you just question me all you want"
Professor Oak(smile) : "i’ve always had this doubt but forgot always to ask you but the start was Feraligator i guess of this bossing around nature cause Pikachu i knew too special the later part i’m saying the beginning now after your formal career what you think the reason suddenly cause surely you and they are getting better each moment and thus you do have an idea i guess...
Ash(thoughtful) : “well i guess it’s all my luck that i’ve had so many pokemons to being with who were extremely unique like Chu to start then Bulbasaur is one and then Muk and Mime and so on 
then after my Battle Frontier Victory Feraligator himeself strangely said like he’s not happy and via Chu i interpreted and Chu said he wants to be in the lab not with me i asked Feraligator directly do you want a second master or do you want to return to your own place cause till then he could breed but didn’t till then and he was dissapointed and told me he’s unhappy to battle but will never leave me he feels sad that he battles so much and he wants to play more then Chu says that he wants to play to battle more and to this Feraligator was so happy said yes and Chu said that cause he was bossing me around so added that battle part himself cause that was going on in his own mind since day one and now Feraligator was speaking his mind so to him in some way must have realized that Feraligator too wants that relation with me and you know how strange my Fraligator has been since day one(laugh,professor oak smile) so then i was bit surprized but came back here and tried to keep Feraligator at Cerulian for a week with Chu but after 3 days Feraligator was agitataed and first time another pokemon like Chu said that this place is boring i want my bunch they are way better and then i realized it’s a matter of Feraligator’s own nature or may be even he hasn’t breed and the few Feraligators present there weren’t of his type so send him here then Trace and Gary told that he unleasehed and similar to him so many wanted that and they assembled togethger and Feraligator became the central figure cause he revolted first and the rest you know what Crawdaunt did and then that 2.4 years of madness with battling each half moment and that pushed their power and then later when they understood that they’ve reached the maximum possible themselves became so happy like as a human if you know you’ve done whatever is there nothing left to even wish for and so happy like the perfect happiness despite may be a very unsatisfactory life you know best what i’m trying to say Professor way more than me(Professor Oak smiles and Ash reciprocates) and i guess my help to them was that i couldn’t anticipate and they were at bay all the time against weaker opponents but i wanted to know them and that’s  why i was out so they liked that and wanted to show me themselves what they were and thus that 2.4 years and now i guess they know what they can and can’t so well that death is so natural to them now they don’t bother about anything and so happy i guess it’s a stage where in general they know what a pokemon life is in our way being human to understand that all one can do is to be honest to the self and thus reciprocate to whatever comes to the best possible way and that’s all about being a human and i guess the way we understand it somehow an inferier version is possible for them and thus they know everything in general terms and not by their own nature as a limited being like we know what deceit is in general not as that how i can be deceitful and thus can detect that in others so that’s what i guess they are doing the happiness is similar if we realize that in human way as i said and you know far better and they can be so happy cause they can detect that unless they have a reason to fight they have no reason to fear anyone and you know best that battles are possible cause we want that not them and that’s what by bunch has broken so that they really don’t want to battle and thus the match won’t take place and if the opponent does they will fail to not give that idea up and thus will lose no matter who they are but if they are say a Mewtwo they will join the play turning on their own master and else they will run back to their master saying we can’t battle at all and those among my bunch who can breed has the natural instinct of choosing and all but to my utmost ashtonishment they say it’s not that there’s not another(both laugh) and you know that means if such a natural situation arise and i’m against a herd of Bayleafs and mine has to protect me she no matter the season will say the same(laugh,Professor Oak smile) i realize that’s their bond with me and the other things that we do to mitigate that need in them but you know they don’t understand that and still don’t bother at all saying lab is enough(both laugh) i guess it’s the pokemon version of the elusive human life of extreme honesty and thus total joviality as if so happy to just be a human no more and that i guess somehow in them reflects and you know why they aren’t like normal animals and all i guess it’s strange but that’s the case and i guess Professor you’d agree that my Feraligator will not be afraid to face 100 Raftosmoric if he knows neither he nor me ever disturbed them and they are only controled by a greedy person or being directed to attack us thus i guess unless i want them really to battle they will not and to be honest(laugh) at their level after 2.4 years of only mental battle(both laugh) if they face a Ghostradarkarrigussonor even they may say and this actually all says that the food is substandard(both laugh) so even if i want them to battle they still won’t bother unless i feel physical threat because i think they want to kill me which you know no pokemon does unless told to no matter what cause they don’t understand this thing as killing naturally abused pokemons just interpret their masteres and injures at the best that they can so thus if i’m not scared then no pokemons can kill me in natural situation cause they don’t really want to if they don’t have a cause that i my pokemons has disturbed them or i have and you know best they don’t understand humans so not natural enemies and thus they won’t undeestand why i’m at their place if i don’t harm their children who is return will feel no harm at all if i don’t hit back and their way of checking humans which makes them pokemons is satisfied and thus when the parents charge at me they will themselves tell that they want this toy(both laugh) and pokemons being that will try to check me and if me and my bunch is right they will themselves hug me to death(both laugh) so it’s no fear there and my fear will be the greed that forces a man to go mad and then i’ve physical danger from a human not pokemon then my bunch will attack them if i’m that much uneasy and myself want to kill the person not just injure and then that is a trouble cause that to my bunch means finally standard food(both laugh) and that fear was why i was always like during battles what i am in press(both laugh) but thus currently that they too are so(both laugh) now they are my masters and their pet name for me if translated sorry for language but they in between their attitude is like ,’why are we told to be disciplined is the master brat battling again against total ididots’(both laugh) and infact even if i force them now they literally scoff at me and the only time they are serious if i’m too much and like today really mean it and they give thier opinions on the whole world in relation to them and me as they see and i just have a few ghosts with me all the time for such reports on things(both laugh) and infact today they saw Mist and you know both our emotions later was telling me why i was so serious(both laugh) you know what i mean just so funny and also my protection as well they are(both laugh) so that’s all Professor i guess my condition forced Feraligator to open up and thus the rest agreed and so on i guess my bunch has mastered and thus so happy living a honest and carefree pokemon life that they have mastered the pokephilosophy(both laugh) and thus are what they are..Chu alone is a Lightenthunstorm max normal level more same as Luxray and no that is self destruction mood which will kill them but you know legendary fights they don’t battle like that and neither will my bunch thus that 2.5 year of mind games and hence their language(both laugh) and now no intention of battling at all..but Professor Chu’s hidden power and intelligence was the reason for his eratic behaviour i guess?”
Professor Oak(smile) : "yeah pretty much,as is Muk(both laugh),and i later only found it out intuitively after handing him to you,but i couldn't take him back from you,you somehow always enticed me with your sweetness and behaviours with you Pokemons Ash and i can now proudly say you deserved Pikachu more than anybody.."
Ash(smile) : "um..thanks Professor and no also that all people on whom i ever used the psyhic or ghost subtle stuff like that were ok i’ve passed 2.5 hours with my 2 day old Heatran at his previous home who hosted me to connect to his compatriots there in psychic channels 2.5 hours including 5 minute breaks in certain span i had Musharna who just reviewed my Heatran’s process cause he was 2 days familiar to me(both luagh) and thus all else 9 from Kalos came let them know what their buddy was doing with me and my intentions thus my confidence but still it’s.."
Professor Oak(smile) : "son,it’s alright in last 1000 may be none ever did that and in next 100 atleast none would unless your future shines on your profession as well(laughs,Ash smiles) i congratulate you again Ash for having Misty and(laugh) all the trouble was that the marriage you talked about,why this 19 year due eventual didn’t take place exactly then(laugh,Ash smiles and blush)..i’m very happy for you two that finally you’ve come together and agreed to marry.I’m overjoyed.”
Ash(smile) : “um..thanks professor..”
Professor Oak(curious) : “by the way,her Golduck atleast surely is unique like you bunch and is there more i guess the Gyarados and Jellicent.."
Ash(smile) : "yeah Golduck surely and Gyarados was well my channel to learn Mist’s everyday life for 7 years so i know her(both laugh) and Jellicent i know pretty well since late Orange was her last there and i myself have a Jellicent so yeah looked too perceptive really same level as Gyarados indeed if not Golduck but may be that’s cause Golduck i know too much(both laugh) but i just hope that Gyarados and Jellicent stays sane(both laugh) cause if that natural rage like our Madgaleo (both laugh) is reversed the gym will have problems(both laugh)"
Professors Oak(smile) : "enough explanation son,but just one more thing,the staffs I guess,Harold right..?"
Ash(bit dejected) : "yeah well you know recent troubles regarding this lab- where
people even in your field are power hungry and ego and greed and all that are trying to jump upon you of all and Trace and Gary of all people after whom Team Rocket was mad suddenly becomes so and so...he can't forget that and chews it at even this age..not me..my sources and you know one normal pat will get that out..you know my activities from Lance..”
Professor Oak(smile) : "Ash,enough said...I know perfectly well who you are and that's

.....(10 minutes later,wakes and calls Tracey Up via Giratina)
Tracey(flustered) : "Ash,i just.."
Ash(dissapointed) : "it was good you weren't there Trace,i couldn't have ever forgiven myself if i said those to you of all people who came here 16 years back only due to me ever saying two nice words for 1 year of constant demands of all kinds and i would've lost you if i ever said those Trace but more would’ve Professor and Gary and that would’ve been unbearable the culmination.."
Tracey(dissapointed) : " Ash,as you said i know you for 17 years,what happened,you tell me and that's all..and no,i would’nt have been lost not this term Ash no matter what atleast not in my core no matter my outside and no i knew that you two had to be together as at 18 between you it was the bond of 36 year husband and wife and then i just at that moment realized no matter what you said later,you did me one of the biggest favours..but now..why drag all in?"
Ash(grim,sigh) : "what else Trace you saw my bunch in that 2.4 years and knew exactly as much i i did and then you young flower dream thought not contacting you for my bunch was my lust and a picture meant that i was a cheat but now i’m a cheat everyone knows if my words are enough for you after 4 year 0 contact and public humilitaion in own den by me and most heinously me putting your own family through hell she was told what i said here as well during our session there,then young flower dream you’ll be my Mist again,no consideration called my mom and called her the same,ran in here looking like 16 straight out of Viridian Lake with 4 pokemons against me of all people at my own den,’i’ve a boyfriend’,why are you here,’you gave a note’,you’re a hall of famer your message could’ve been delivered in innumerable ways,’you cheated on me you namecall,i hate you,give me a ring and go back to the b.. you sweet idiot don’t call me hall of famer i’m your Mist and you’re only my Ash only mine you are you namecalled cute jerk’ (laugh) same stuff Trace then said i’m saying i’m marrying you as soon as you agree just give me a chance,no we’re done and now said why you not the police comes that in the voice straight out of Trovita(laugh)”
Tracey(broad smile) : "i realize Ash,but we'll always be your friends and we may not be Misty
but you'll have us right behind"
Ash(hugging Tracey,smile) : "Trace would any damn friend or damn brother or damn family even do to my bunch what you and Gary and both your wives later did for 4 long years of devillish atrocity only because you needed it for your career that too you only for 1.5 years?"
Tracey(hugging Ash,smile) : "its ok pal,just go back to Misty,she’s your only cure and she's waiting"
Ash(broad smile,hugging Tracey) : "thanks Trace..you all are similar to her to me she the most cause she’s my wife for eternity and all these cause she was given umpteenth number of chances only then could she express herself fully,none of you were given than due to my devillish illusion,you all have been with me Trace for as long as Mist has been(both pat each other smiling and then break the hug) and she odered me to put the smiles back no matter what,i've managed all,please you look after Daisy,look after her and if you can spare me.."
Tracey(smile) : "Ash,you already have that and always will..(both sees Daisy who came a bit later and was standing beside)"
Daisy(solemn) : "it's all right Ash..No i heard Tracey going out of the room..followed and
listened.have you spoken to Lil?"
Ash(dissapointed) : "ya,but look after her ok,she and You,barring my 2nd badge and all the subsequent i never doubted any of you ever cause despite whoever i may be i’ve been travelling the world for 19 years i can understand that there wasn’t any reason for two men like these two to be there in the way they have ever been unless they were fully reflected to themselves(laugh,Tracey smiles,Daisy faint smile) that’s my Garchomp just always their words are buzzing in my ears anyway,hence it’s just pure logic that is..please i shouldn't have been what i have been for 4 years and there’s no pardon for that..but if you can,please spare.."
Daisy(solemn) : "Ash, it's alright but don't torture Mist ever again ok?she can’t be literally alive without you and you saw that yourself..she'll too happily move according to your Finger movements all her life,just don't make her suffer for that"
Ash(faint smile) : "Daisy,just like you have Trace and Lillie has Gary,Mist is in safe hands i give you my words,only better days ahead"
Daisy(solemn) : "go back as soon as you can,it’s ok here and tell her to sleep well,'night"
Ash(smile) : "Goodnight Daisy and Tracey you too"
Tracey(smile) : "yeah Ash and pick up the Picture tomorrow afternoon ok?"
Ash(dissapointed) : "Trace,thanks man but no rush cause there’s more as what i told Daisy of never having any suspicion was my 15 years before and during the 4 i was confused about exactly that hence my 4 years and that quote i told as to tell you keep up your work here and beacuse of me don’t jeopardize yourself and was a general sense then i was in illusion as to if you and Daisy really meant it that you two are married now and all and now the future as well or was kinda forced like random samples suddenly coming out of blue and then no matter what separates this idea gripped me even more after i heard about Melody Sanders you know her whole world does in Kanto-Johto atleast and i told Gary in details he will tell you if you ask him anytime i ever had contacts with Melody for 12 years cause of that intuition and i came to know just after my break-up while i was in Safforn before undercover that she had a brat who cheated on her after both went off the grid and had to erase the evidences so that the brat can proceed to next and you understand Melody’s condition after her career and all and this was after another heartbreak but of normal nature and she despite my professionality which is what you know ever was so friendly and may be expected a big bro out of me cause her nature is too nice too frank thus apparent frivolity and was fuelled at Kalos of course and she may be expected that i never bothered only been professional to her and even that was so much for her and was happy now out of profession,married at Levender,John Harrison double Kanto,psychic specialist now at Levender actually her childhood friend happy life but no no contact with me for more than a year professionality was what i epitomised to her that overflowed to the personal life of her so respects that and i don’t want to break that either now that incident coupled with the stardom and all and no Daisy ever stayed away from that mess of starship but still i was mad whole psychic bunch was used to gruel both you and her with max protection possible keeping in mind of the future as well and Lillie and Gary was similarly tested with full security and all arrangements subtle body stuffs you know better than me the details rest Gary will tell you the details i told him just before and no that room today won’t allow you to enter Marshadow was there at doorstep especially for you had you returned suddenly and the reason you were out was me as well cause Trace you know my position and who Lance is and Sinnoh Elite4 is run by me infact and Kalos Elite4 head Persy of all you sure know his status big fanboy and all these still had to be sure and no nothing went out of family nothing could and the things i told Professor you know those as well you told me in that state as did Daisy and what you two are to each other soulmate the right word and just the assurence for me that you weren’t forced or anything by the stuffs at Cerulian and i was suspicious as to both of them now here and so on and Daisy’s attempts of arranging a marriage for her baby sis didn’t help her either but Daisy was 1000% right cause she was her mom and ever is and her confusion with me will take time to go cause she is as perfect gentlewoman as you’re a man but that sentimental roughness is there to veil it cause you know and all of us do what was her condition at 19 with mom and dad not being there just the apprehension and family responsibility made sure outsiders don’t get a chance still i know about things and thus my confusion and those were same as those attempts of arrangements and also i know absolute her views of Mist and all around her the starship pain and the skills and fame and so on all my confusion illusion dream not real meaningless i’m only so happy that’s all and Daisy hasn’t eavesdropped now cause she’s a bit dizzy to even want to come out again and she rushed to her room a bit quickly and all just Giratina who woke you up and you know his very own nature of momentary analysis of all changes and this all is to keep you informed that i’m not all honest with my bunch and there’s more to me than...”
Tracey(hugging Ash,smile) : “stop there bro just that,that word is why i was here 16 years back and why still here cause Gary is same and you know the rest and those psychics i’ve had atleast Marshadow since day one pestering me forever(laugh,Ash smiles faintly) i know what he can do and they can do and why so and why Giratina can do to what he is doing to Dase in her condition overall and why that name along with names like Ultranercozma,Hoopa and so on do these as all the answer rests right here(smiles and hugs Ash a bit more firmly,Ash hugs Tracey finally smiling) in all due honesty of ethical morality of honesty(both laugh and then break the hug)
(both smile) and that Guzzlord too why those words i’ll hear tomorrow once more first thing better not now though out in the middle for my own well being(both laugh).."
Ash(smile) : “yeah thanks man but i’ve a query..”
Tracey(smile) : "what?"
Ash(laugh) : "the 5 weeks.."
Tracey(laugh) : "your grandsons will plead with me then only i may help to extend that,just return,by-the-way,you spoke with Brock?"
Ash(smile) : "thanks for the compliment Trace,and no,i owe him big time,but i'm just
too tired today and it won't be nice if i suddenly appear today and at late night like this Violet is there and.."
Tracey(thoughtful) : "Ash,i in the mess you created couldn't call Brock or even May..I don't
know but,you can go and no Violet won't mind either,you know both most well that your two words suffices if no the three that’s just so naive(both laugh) and they'll be pleased"
Ash(smile and hugging Tracey) : "thanks for the encouragement Trace,may be i should take Mist with me here tomorrow morning to show the words as well(both laugh) or may be she already has called Violet, anyway i'll see him thanks"
Tracey(bit concerned) : “but finally Ash,that thing you gave..”
Ash(bit dejected) : “yeah was telling Gary...4+ months or so since the day Daisy had that skirmish first with Mist and then couldn’t keep to herself here and Mist only went overboard with that as you know her character...sampled from her room,confirmed at Safforn,today took her there on dragon travel first thing after patch up had a dinner came back was sitting when you met us..a few good words all done 65% poison off all mental stuff you know my psychic bunch and the rest of my level you’ll know the rest part that you know as you do by your observations but now i’m here so concrete plus i’ve been under all covers and Trace that stunt and the Kalos one you heard were played upon all of us there umpteenth times due to the invincibility of my bunch to get the master emotionally broken and that gender have had enough with it Trace really and all these 65% thus is childs play for me to cure atleast 3-4% in any random sample using my own system and my bunch without much effort i know her for 19 since 16 nothing to me to get 65 with a few very basic medicines already learnt all there in that Cabin of mine just ask Marshadow and/or Banette will let you in inside lock they are taught to open that and atleast either will be around there till those are removed by any of you 4 or me,kept those today morning only via them and all the 65 was cause the bug only too eager to sit on my head suck her my Ash all her life being totally blind to anything else as usual and i’ve seen far worse stuffs doses and conditions..i said you cheated having agreed to date people why agree to begin with, the answer was like,’why don’t you like me Ash’(laugh,Tracey smiles)..knows absolutely nothing and the physical cures got a few good stuffs Henry Care Safforn subtle body full dragon took may be 50 minutes max all were ready at Safforn even if now i went..Doctor Rashford and Michelle knows me well around undercover as well as Sabrina’s recommendation on me after the undercover ever had connection they were all there and the rest according to their directions just all money nothing else you know the earnings and gatefees and those press and rest only will fuel that and i want that all bit to use for all the places that i want to just an elusive name along with the bunch in and out of profession all rubbish..but(smile)..Trace you know the her and my real cures don’t you..”
Tracey (smile) : "just Goodnight Ash undercover and Unova days were enough to tell people who you were in this profession then the next 3 meant you’re once in a millenia in profession and outside all will know what means Crawdauntogator alteast if they know undercover and Unova but(laugh) and about your innemurable genders and our suspicion,in or out of profession none can never forget someone telling an international press that he is dissapointed cause many were ignorant in the class that teaches the differetiation process between bro and beau(laugh,Ash smiles),don't be late for your double doeses"
Ash(smile) : "right and ‘night".
.......(meanwhile Misty calls Brock just after Ash has left)...
Brock(concerned) : "hellow,Misty!How are you?Viol told me,that..”
Misty(sigh) : “Brock,please,nobody knows Ash better than you and i assure you He’s that same Ash as ever as you met first..no i’m fine,i ‘ve decided to get engaged to him on my own choices and terms,he didn’t force or threaten me to..he himself was totally torn apart inside may be way more than me myself and thus his public antics.i just gave him a chance..please..if you can spare him a thought and yes Viol called me first,you know her,she’s on the way home..just keep safe..
Brock(solemn) : “yeah,i’ll see Viol..and congratulations Misty but..um..just stay safe and keep your eyes open,that’s all i’m saying...”
Misty(solemn) : “thanks Brock,i will and just take care of Viol and don’t let her call us,i told you what i had to,Viol will get onto Ash’s nerves and you know the rest..Ash was on the verge of lunacy himself just his natural sweetness and warmth has kept him sane..please...just take care as soon as we meet we’ll do the rest..”
Brock(solemn) : “yeah,Misty,got you and just take care..’Night”..
...............................
Delia(concerned) : “um Mist,Ash..”
Misty(bit dissapointed) : “it’s ok mom he’s fine but mom but all these 6 years then yesterday..um..”
Delia(smile) : “mom.that’s all ever for 16(hugs Misty,Misty beams)..”
Misty(smile) :”thanks mom,yeah,he’s out to appolozize to all and told me might be late cause has some issues in the farm just a set up told me you know his stuffs and his bunch,he’s a sought after man now everywhere especially for covert things that place has Sinnoh Elite4 office bearers secret..”
Delia(tendering Misty,bit concerned) : “um..yeah,i know but you know as well Mist,that’s how his dad went and then all this..i just don’t like it..he wasn’t home for 4 years always not interested,barely talked about himself even was very harsh and rude to me..so much..but i only hoped that he’s ok cause his honesty never left him only grew you know what kind of fortune comes with his position and even more with his name in public now rather i afraid to say dreaded he is everywhere in his profession and all that fortune all in my hands and Javier his friend Susana’s other half helps me and him,doesn’t care at all everything goes to gyms and other places for helping the whole world even his personal sponsorships never if not directly related to pokemons and even there if only about them not him and thus only if they let him speak of his experiences the exact things that he uses for long or has been satisfied or here the lab told him then only does and all the fortune from there all driven here to contact the lab then comes to me then goes everywhere and all i’m all too secured as is he for the rest of life but it comes with things like uncodercover and all and i’m no professional but Mimey i know inside out and she can work independently of me and even suggests to me small things regarding her daily routine if i forget just reminds me in a wau more cognizable manner as to point out the exact needs which is impossible and i’m all protected thus as well with such a psychic pokemon and she is a very strong type being fairy-psychic as well i read things as you know and all of you told me and during Unova you know all those psychics were with me and Mime was with him for 6 months thrice in spans but you know today after i got the news via Gary that Ash hasn’t behaved well with Professor Oak of all..really i was scared to death..”
Misty(smile) : “no mom,it’s just that..um..he just never came into terms with our bearkup and was always agitated plus all the things he has done..he wasn’t just balanced sometimes did get too agitated..but he’s well now..”
Delia(smile) : “yeah and now he has my sweet little daughter as well(Misty smiles)...Ash just was hiding his pain from the break-up and only when he came back here 4 weeks back after 4 long years did i realize it..i heard Mist,what he did with you and gym..i just didn’t know what has got to him..anyhow,honey(smiles at Misty)..you’ve yourself been in a very difficult situation and mental state..how are you now?”
Misty(smile) : “i’m ok mom..i just never came to agreement with that break up either and then the Gym and show and all that..i just was depressed but now i’m ok..Ash himself cured me..and all that remains he will too with his position..um..(blushes,Delia smiles)..”
Delia(smile) : “i’m so happy to have you back Mist as well,i just couldn’t believe myself then either..but only good days are ahead now..but(smile)..where did he take you?”
Misty(blush,smile) : “um..Safforn..(Delia surprized)..no it’s alright at his level you know his bunch it’s just plane journey without the jetlag(smiles and blushes,Delia smiles)..and it..um..it was good..(blushes)..”
Delia(smile) : “i see,that’s just the regeneration(Misty blushes and smiles)...anyhow Mist,you must be tired now and you do look very much so...lets go prepare the beds..he’ll be late i’ve realized just come on and have something..by-the-way Mist,youre in the Hall of Fame too...”
 .....(Ash returns,2:00 AM)...
Ash(agitated) : "Ah!food,food,just 15 minutes i’ve till i go to my room(Misty and Delia laughs),the brats at resturants always cheat(Misty and Delia laughs)..Mime have you eaten my food up as well?"
Mr Mime : <you’re idiotic so was wasting your time with substandard food>..(Delia laughs and Misty bursts intto laughter)
Ash(trying to wrestle Mr Mime) : "i show you..you cl.."
Delia(frown,Misty laughs) : "Ash leave her alone"
Ash(whinning) : "she always eats my foods,messes my things up,doesn’t open the door quickly when i come back(both laugh),conspires with my bunch to sabotage my sleep(both Delia and Misty burst into laughter) and she prefers you over me always(both laugh even more)...(frown)Mime,i'm your actual master,you know that"
Mime : <idiotic master brat never knows time to attack first so counters idiotically>(both burst into laughter)
Ash(frown) : "and she taught you say this?(Delia and Misty burst into laughter) i'll show you,you..Ganger,Greninja,Pikachu,Sableye"
(all joins Mime)
Ash(scowl) : "so i'm the devil's favourite villian then universally accepted? (sigh) really Ash
Ketchum,your playing luck has turned"(all burst into laughter)
(after Ash goes to change and refresh)
Delia(smile) : "Pokemon Master or alleged Playboy,with his pokemon ever the little baby,that nature is his true self, that's my real Ash and that hasn't been remotely tainted,i'm overjoyed"
Misty(smile) : "yes mom,he's true nature indeed is exactly like that,and he shall be like that always"
Delia(smile) : "seeing my Ash with his pokemons, it's just the most beautiful thing and now i've got you as the crown jewel on top,my little honey"
Misty(smile) : "thanks mom,i'm all too happy".
Delia Ketchum(smile,hugging Misty) : "Mist,i'm so happy to have you two back,Ash hasn't been
home the last 4 years,always bit unmindful and i also heard you weren’t well either in the Gym despite all you success,but now i'm so happy to have him back to his own self as is Mimey and we all have you,really it's so wonderful"
Misty(smile,hugging Delia) : "mom,only better days ahead it will be,and i'm ecstatic myself
that i'm officially now part of the Ketchum Family"
Delia(smile) : "you know with all these I just feared i lost Ash because simply that he created a grave trouble at the Lab,i just couldn't believe myself and despite all what i heard and his elusiveness,today i really was scared that i've lost Ash.."
Misty(smile) : "mom,he's been a bit stressed,that's all,he needs rest and closure and he's getting that, don't worry"
Delia(smile) : "no i don't,now that you're with us as well,i absolutely don't"
Misty(smile) : "thanks Mom"...
..(night at room)...
Ash(relief) : "Ah,finally i get to.."
Misty(smirk) : "not so fast dear.."
Ash(frown) : "what?i cant fondle my flower all i want?(Misty burst into laughter)"
Misty(smile) : "i want the few things you promised me.."
Ash(frown,hugging Misty) : "attitude?(both burst into laughter,then hug each other)..say(both burst into laughter).."
Misty(laugh) : "i may want to revive the Sensational Sisters(bursts into laughter)"
Ash(grim) : "the gym itself isn't enough?"
Misty(smiling,cajoling Ash's cheeks) : "no cause you’re Ash Ketchum,Pokemon Master,Hall of Fame all of his own.why don't you want me back to the shows then?"
Ash(grim,hugging Misty) : "if only i'm allowed to manage you,then i may consider it"
Misty(smirk) : "that means.."
Ash(irritated) : "none gets to interview you,no autographs,no photoes,no publicity,no travel,inside the gym only,brief shows,only weekends,high ticket price,limited seats.."
Misty(bursts into laughter) : "men not allowed?"
Ash(frown) : "exactly and neither unmarried women who are way more dangerous specially if young(Misty laughs uncontrollably),only those with children allowed that too only girl childs upto 8 years(Misty bursts into laughter).."
Misty(laughing) : "and you expect the business to run beyond the first show?"
Ash(irritated) : "to become my private show(Misty laughs)..only my mermaid you are forever(Misty laughs)..i don’t care,in the gym none can look at my flower except ME(Misty bursts into laughter,Ash also smiles and hugs Misty firmly)...hum..my flower is ONLY mine and that’s it..i’ll adore my flower,fondle my flower,cherish my flower,nourish my flower,tender my flower all 24/7 IN the gym..(Misty bursts into laughter)..(frown)..why what’s wrong?(whinning)i will adore my flower all the time that’s all.."
Misty(smirk,tendering Ash’s cheeks) : “sweetness turns bitter if tasted too much”(bursts into laughter,Ash scowls and frowns and hugs Misty)..who said that sweetie(laughs)..?”
Ash(irritated) : “no,whoever said,my flower is perpetually sweet(Misty laughs)..(frown,angry)..why don’t those h.. b...”
Misty(frown) : "Ash! what is it with you dear,you never used to say these things no matter what."
Ash(disappointed) : "no you’re only MY flower...(hugging Misty very firmly)..Mist,just don't leave me for even a day"
Misty(hugging Ash very firmly,smile) : "sweetie,I’m ever with you..soully..hum..(smiles at Ash,Ash smiles at Misty and they keep hugging each other for a few moments)...Ash,we’ll have more than ample time to enjoy together no matter what but dear,you don't have to be so cruel on the fans,we had to abruptly closed it down and i just want to relax and enjoy"
Ash(grim,tendering Misty’s cheeks) : "it's not about them Mist,i have to tell you so many things my nerves are too agitated i need to have you beside me everyday for the next two three months atleast then it’s alright i’ll be fine more than that but (hugging Misty very firmly)..Mist i know when i said that what was going though you(Misty smiles and hugs Ash very firmly and smiles at him,Ash smiles at her) 25 days were enough to marry you and register that and then go only nothing would’ve happened Mist,you were talking about jealousy and then other things then said let me go then all those(Misty smiles and tenders Ash’s hairs)..i saw your face Mist and i was thinking about my own level and you are a hall of famer and all and Mist you’ve been nowhere near me since Hoenn advanced knockouts and in groups only if you were my sweetie and with me like you were at Johto with 65-35 and then in Johto you were better than me only beacuse of my flower i went ahead upto semis and now i don’t care about levels cause from here it makes no sense and thus i was seeing you and..(very dissapointed,hugging Misty very firmly,Misty hugs Ash very firmly smiling at him) you know what i said Mist during the time we had our session today and you know my bunch just they are like this and i’m and my Mist is me this much is reality with the other two and my Mist is my sweet wife in this form i don’t want to know a word more about her unless you want i will not talk about professional things with you just my bunch cause they are funny and a few things what they are doing but as usual Mist i don’t want that to come in between us cause my sweet flower isn’t built like me here this term Gyarados,Goldy may be Jellicent too will become jovial being with me but according to your nature but not the whole and you can’t act like me cause of that inherent difference and exactly why you and me are separately appearing to each other you want your Ash most and i want my Mist as much as well but just the form is different i can’t have the longing you have for me in that form just like you can’t have that bond with your bunch..we’re thus only make it full if together Mist and that’s that as we realized together hand in hand soul in soul(smiles at Misty still dissapointed,Misty broadly smiles at Ash both same pose),i don't demand much dear but just for the next two weeks in Pinkenberry.."
Misty(smile,tendering Ash’s cheeks) : "Ash,the past is past,please you said it yourself,don’t torture yourself like this,i aslo get tortured then won’t i(both smile at each other)...please sweetie I know how much you’ve suffered but now we’re married and all is and will be all alright..hum..(both smiles at each other and firmly hugs each other for a few moments)...and no I won't overwork and i don't want you to be away from me for a moment now as well,but it's just that you know,i like to be engaged and energetic always.that's all"
Ash(smile,hugging Misty very firmly) : "yes Mist,but you know all my things with my level and bunch i was telling Professor an hour ago may be or a bit more it’s just so much of variation of states and you know what i did with you today and all and i’ve got you back after so many years need to calm down to get habituated to the new surroundings and to just want to be with you now which i've never been able to for so so many years infact since Johto, it's just been 14 years that i've passed more than 28 days together with you,and i just want to be with you all the time like your own shadow..(Misty smiles broadly and tenders Ash’s cheeks).."
Misty(smiling) : "you're doing exactly that Ash,don't worry,but.."
Ash(grim) : "what is it Mist? i know from the very sources what you had to go through.."
Misty(hugging Ash,smiling) : "no, nothing about that,Ash that we're done with,never
bring that up again,promise me?"
Ash(hugging Misty,smiling) : "yeah Mist done."
Misty(smiling) : "right.but you know you've taken a huge toll yourself and mom confirmed that,i just want to polish every little strain off from my sweet diamond..(broad smile)"
Ash(smile) : "say what you were saying"
Misty(smile and laugh) : "i just wanted to know how many feathers you've ruffled to get to me and
that has left you so torn apart inside..No,take your months,but just that
among our close friends,families and your travel companions that is your sis and my little bro and Cilan,this much would do for me."
Ash(bit disappointed) : "no just told them i’ll remain strict professional no personal terms that’s all Cili was afraid after Unova fled Unova Elite4 itself 4 years later was back some professional reasons wanted himself to speak with me since then been friends again and comic relief(laugh,Misty as well laughs) his greeting is ‘whenever you call me i feel so overjoyed it feels like um..Cili..Cili..(both burst into laughter)..’ he gets angry says be professional the answer is ‘i see professional,sweet sweet Cili what is the nomination status there for gyms(both burst into laughter)’ and that does the trick each time then he shuts up about my personal life where his ever opinion is i’m childish needs to be looked after he’s like Harris and Kane now you know very nice friend,Iris fled after that now married Hoenn she won and then itself settled down no contacts with me just Cili and i don’t know but you may know about Cili a living dictionary to the whole world on all Unova breeds and he’s a dragon specialist too well known to be just renouned across the world on everything Unova and his wife Jane as well same specialist breeder and is extremely well know and great by all means and all cause she takes my side since day one much to Cili’s dismay(both laugh) i would’ve been nothing without him in life as a whole to be honest i’ll tell you later the Unova part then all rest during our honeymoon cause it’ll take ages and then Tony and Braum was that Cerulian is whole world and i wasnt in it been strict professionals only no personal matter,Harris and Kane never spoke once about our strained relation then only just told me to remain calm and that same afterwards still though i told them to be professional and they got the idea never mingled much but i have contacts with all four once a week and 10 minutes minimum on certain issues and rest Penny,Ritchie etc were anyway great friends but never to that level so anyway was fine and Mist i’m sure you’ve foisted upon my infoes despite all things whole world wants me and my sweet flower was here and i went to appease them by giving times..(hugs Misty very firmly,Misty smiles and tenders Ash’s hairs and cheek) but i was is and ever am lost being Ash in my Mist that is(smiles at Misty and Misty as well smiles at Ash hugging him very firmly, moments later) anyway thus all have stayed like that and rest travel companions same senor never would return cause she got the anatomy of stool and urine eternalized for her as a b..mate to anyone by vitue of being the definition of the word and family was told as well in exact terms then only returned via Danny Orange gym leader during Elite4 they were relations his(laugh)..”
Misty(frown) : “Ash that was too harsh for a moment of..(Ash stops her from talking,then hugs her very frimly looking at her)
Ash(smile) : “my sweetie was in same situation after Johto after 4 years and i was your husband then in my mind as well Mist you know that and was only waiting for you to say for a change(both laugh hugging each other) then Brock was there even though cause i kept him as i feared my flower is too stricken(both laugh) and Brock is Brock if present would’ve written novels on that for next 100 years(both laugh) and my Mist didn’t do one thing and Mist i understand emotions but that was public humiliation after 2 years of constant observation and she knew i was ever her big bro nothing else and how my personal life was despite whatever was said and then i get that treatment then family comes up i was too harsh not that they were not sorry but still i directly told my mom as well as Professor was present they were used them as communication channel i said if so much longing despite knowing what their daughter did and i have no contacts at all still so much longing then to accuse me with my name and all get an immediate biological proof and get the meaning of this out yourselves mom was there i don’t care she and me know each other inside out i don’t care about any b.. cause i’ve been with 50 such b.. who were after me undercover each day for 3+ months emotional torture cause my bunch was invincible but as none knows who’s who there they come up with all and then not once could do anything but you know Mist i’m no enlightened being so it broke me apart in that situation really and then after that i go out and all these and that stunt was performed on me quite a few times during undercover each were shown that anatomy flew off but that was only blood and sweat the most polite once Mist but if i stay suspicicous and thus keep my psychics around of all all times both they and me will go totally mad and hence i put my guard down after that but Mist even if i face that now being compelled to no nothing beyond the stunts and their replies but you know that same garbage still will charm me for varying lengths atleast no matter the numeric degree of them Mist cause that idea of difference else even you i still want you in this gender don’t i Mist no matter what..”
Misty(few minutes later,smiling at Ash,tenders Ash cheeks and hairs) : “sweetie,you lied to me then didn’t you that only 2 stunts(giggles at Ash,Ash laughs both same pose),Ash i know your gender and mine and i know the level you’re talking about is far away may be many lives and certainly in this for sure that is far away very very much so from both of us but as you said we’ll only go there together too won’t we Ash if reality truely shines it won’t matter(both smile at each other) and Ash still as much as we both know i know me and that’s all my Ash is just me(both smiles at each other same pose,some minutes later)..just be happy now...”
Ash(smiles at Misty,both same pose,few minutes later) : “no more Mist till right time just want the 3 reals of being really Ash again and again inside me and you know me as much as my view has  been clarified along with you Mist you know as do i,you’re just me and i’m just my Mist(both smiles at each other same pose then keeps hugging each other very firmly for a few more minutes)..but finally,Max well you know it was very hard for me i did introduce him to Cili and Brock he has had contacts with and then you know how straight and simple the kid is i after Undercover was at a state that i don’t want to remember Mist really one side was Crawdauntogator and another side were the human emotions and i wasn’t well i just didn’t pay any attention to him for 3/4 times a few may be at Kalos as well and he got clue you know him extremely intelligent himself no words for 4 years now or so and Kalos you know he understood the ego and money and Cili always have had contacts with him still does so does Brock i’m sure and he has kept professional with Cili and has he despite the 4 years and Max is Max you know utmost professional and perfect by all means yet exactly the same in core as he was when i first saw him as a 13 year old sweet little boy hellbent to follow his big sis all the time..i feel bad for that really he’s 9 years younger to me and my bro as much as is May my sis but just that year gap is too huge and our fields are different and all but May..um,well that's for another day.."
Misty(dissapointed and frown) : "you didn't even spare your little sis?"
Ash(dissapointed) : "um..no but not as much as you're thinking,i just sweared her off on her 1st anniversary(Misty sighs) as it was the very next day after that Kalos fiasco and that eversweet ‘hi!bro!’ that day sounded just too pungent you know forgot that for once in 12 years that she is not my own flesh and blood my sweet little sis ever..then forgot that and recalled how i found my sis rather and thus that sound just made me mad..would’ve done the same to my own flesh and blood which is what our relation actually is and why i did what i did in my subconscious and i just wish she understands my position or atleast spare a thought for me that i just wasn’t well at all cause that moment after 2 years and Kalos personally is most memorable for me cause i’ve learnt so many things as i told you but that moment has left a very deep scar..i only wish i can get to meet Max as well as May mostly or talk to her once more that’s all..neither she nor Drew nor any ever one word about my personal life ever said keep an eye on ego win against that counter(laugh,Misty smiles at Ash while tendering his hairs),i was invited despite all to Pettlesburg,Mrs Maple very formal just the curtsey i just faitly smiled and Mr Maple as well very professional just both wanted to know about mom’s health and all i said yeah fine and just brief visit Mr Maple just said no matter people knows too well about May and your long travel companionship and it’s just a matter of formality for him as well to invite me cause all knows our bond and it will be uncomfortable for both sides if this visit wasn’t there i said yeah i guess but thanks for the invitation was there for 45 minutes max i guess you know i never cared about any officiality so travelled as just a random bloke and i have had my ways cause of Tyranitar since the inception at Unova(laugh,Misty tenders Ash’s hairs) but May i feel bad i scoffed at her and the language was bad but then i said in that same language you two may break up today as you’re counting the number of years now as if random samples waiting to go off saying sorry a mistake..that was cause you know Drew and May is exactly Ash and Misty same relation soulmate and you know how much i pestered Drew with vomits(laugh,Misty smiles at Ash tendering his hairs) and i know him and the viseversa as siblings as well and Drew is my idol in honesty to own self and then to your girlfriend 3 draws not once about own career and i thought if you were my travel companion and girlfriend you still just a pushover(laughs,Misty smiles at Ash and tenders his hairs)...i’ve been hurting inside since that day beyond measures but i didn’t care Mist and you know why..with my reach and power i grilled people at gym behind your back and know these she did keep contacts untill your doses started didn’t she.."
Misty(concerned) : "yes she did and Max too untill he picked up the clue of my indifference as well but Ash,you have to get rid of these habits if you already haven't-if you can by your dark pokemons make people a bit psychologically vulnerable then can push it by trash talking,you can hypnotize people and know their secrets and you also can create multiple instances..(Ash smiles at Misty and puts his palm on her mouth,Misty bit surpprized)..”
Ash(smile,hugging Misty firmly) : “no more! My flower always only beams(Misty smiles at Ash hugging him firmly) sweetie..(both smile at each other,same pose)...you’re so sweet Mist i want to dissolve in you that’s all as me(both smiles at each other and hugs each other very firmly,few moments later)..me and my bunch live in a psychic channel the things you’re saying are like a 1 day old baby to a 100 year old damn brat(both laugh) the similar figures are projected by your psychic type as accrodingly he can do of him that only engages him more so that trick is useless and that why my sweetie should play on my lap without any worries(both smile at each other,Misty tenders Ash’s hairs) i myself can do many things but all in good times Mist not today i used them on separately over the 4 in lab knew all that i said Lillie herself told me about that incident with Gary i need my bunch to make them throw upon me just what they’re holding onto then i question out or i jump them and test no the gym you understand was due to my headhsip of Sinnoh Elite4(laughs,Misty same pose smiles at Ash) all my buddies are just so attuned to me we’re relatively the same in certain regards as you know what i’m talking about and that’s why i was so murderous over all personal relations barring my mom cause i never got that feel of joy anywhere here till i you gave me a chance(Misty smiles and hugs Ash very firmly)..you’ve ever been and will be my gateway to live here(both smile at each other for a few moments hugging each other very firmly)..the damn details of psychic subconscious bodies and all i know only intuitionally thus can’t tell you like that nor do i want to gibberish not with my sweet flower the two buffoons here knows the same amount as me in words so they will word the process by which they were contacted and then their wives in sub subtle whatever state while the rest were dozed off by innumerable brats(both laugh) anyway,just ask them for details today itself told them what i did they by now has learnt quadruple times more about it than me cause they are the ones who keep my brats happy at their cost(both laugh) and about those illusions i just never bothered but i surely can and i’m completely immune to those..if one has one scant thought of battling i’m invincible and my bunch is the reason and i’ll hold sway over his or her bunch cause i want pure friendship with all as human or pokemon that’s the soul(both smiles at each other)..i don’t understand Goldy’s language very well cause he was a Psyduck then but was saying like lets play long time hasn’t been able to and all...just a psychological strain for many months due to what you had to go through for me..No Mist,it’s alright..wants to play around as you know and got me and that’s all...somehow managed to send him back cause wouldn’t go and i didn’t even release any of mine cause given who they are now it’ll be impossible to stop their fooling around before ages as i had innumerable ghosts with me(both smile)..just looked at him and was just laughing to myself that these fellows so happy cause they would never understand human emotions(both smile at each other)...anyway Mist,please i tell you and you know as well you’re nature won’t allow you to do the things you were upto forcefully cause force means you don’t want it and no force or no force i couldn’t forget you ever in subconscious and i told you why and that’s it and please Mist,i’m telling you never try exactly that..that’s the exact path to hell if there’s ever one..i’ll not be able to get my sweet flower back from there if she pushes too hard and can’t be sane..but i won’t go to see whoose in bed with whom or who does what i’ve seen so much during undercover and since childhood i just don’t care about garbages that’s all...i just don’t care about those namecalled(Misty smiles) powers at all cause power means you’re dishonest with yourself and sacrificing you your family and dear ones but most criminally being that don’t understand you and just loves you now you’re cheating upon them cause you can’t get in bed with someone or murder someone deceive someone and so on and those powers need feeding so that you can maintin them and this exact process is path to hell as it swells up ego and totally makes you lunatic then eats away your body and bust...i’m totally immune to any power of or on me as i carry myself like that and all...i just want to be souled with my bunch and they do what they do it’s funs and games as i’ve told you my nature is to be another to know another as me my soulmate is most dear that is all else a bit less and that’s all you’re you and not you the not you part is your physical appearence of your Ash and thus you so much want it cause only then you’re full and me and not me has to go hand in hand thus your temperament in chilhood and still will be with me(both laughs) you’re view is who is me who isn’t thus once you got an warm hand by heart you demand was that it’ll ever be so and thus Trace and Brock is ever your big bros and thus you behaved thus with them all of you are so happy(both smiles)..and i’ve got nothing to do here anymore and never had either except for my illusion to get trophies that all i want is that my mom stays with me as long as possible and i want my wife with me all time as long as possible and my bunch as well who as i said are same as my mom and my wife and that’s it(Misty tenders Ash’s hairs)..these are my two demands really the future is totally your choise and wish i’ve got nothing to do there cause my role is support forever your role is nourish forever(both smile at each other) and that’s all really,no other personal demands...but my sweet flower should never get intentionally mingled with f.. psychic powers(frown) cause a h.. b.. like me..”
Misty(frown,sigh) : “Ash,enough with hovering over the past just shut up,i’m your wife”
Ash(whinning,hugging Misty firmly) : “no my sweet flower should only play around with me and pokemons and gym battle if only she wants and not due to the challengers(Misty laughs)..nobody can challenge my sweetie(Misty bursts into laughter)..those..anyway,please Mist,never push yourself too much..but during battles my sweet flower frowns and scowls which make her even more so so sweet sweet Mist flower(smile,Misty laughs) if you’re in opposition i will think of two words only(both laugh) but i know those dumb bufoons will pester her for badges(Misty laughs)...Mist,you just be youself which is eternally sweetest Mist flower(tendering Misty’s cheeks)..rest will be known as you know just you be you and me ok,promise?”
Misty(smile,tendering his cheeks and hair) : "right,i got you and it’s a promise.but anything else you want to say about your adventures with some beau gadgets,especially the illegal bit(both bursts into laughter)?"
Ash(laugh) : "how i transmitted the chorus to everyone in such a big gym with varied pokemons? no that i um.. went impersonally to Professor Kukui's Lab(both laugh) and was like->(immitating mechanical voice) ’i want to reconcile with my fiancee by abjectly beating her in a gym battle illegally(both laugh) so that she gets even more angry with me and i get attached to her skin(both laughs) or inside her room at midnight (both bursts into laughter) to make sure that all her grievances are only because i didn’t fondle her also while choosing her pokeballs myself(both laughs)’...(hugging Misty)Mist,i need you to be myself(smile)"
Misty(hugging and cajoling Ash) : "Ash, you've got me all the time and you know it.enough answers dear we should now give it a rest"
Ash(smile) : "yeah,but now you've got me going,i tell you the main things"
Misty(smile) : "take your time Ash."
Ash(dissapointed) : "why,can't i just keep gazing at you whole night?(Misty laughs)..i've never had the opportunity since i broke into your room(both laugh).."
Misty(smirk) : "gazing,hum?long lost habit,but carry on,i want the same,though i had ample time to do that"
Ash(laugh) : "that's at best exclusive recordings of events(Misty bursts into laughter)..Mist i knew you’re just me that day too and wanted to abduct you really you were so sweet(both laugh)..”
Misty(smile,cajoling Ash's cheeks) : "right.but Ash,you truely are a living legend once(Ash stops her talking,then firmly hugs her,Misty smiles at Ash and tenders his cheeks and hairs).."
Ash(smile) : “my Ash is only me..(hugging Misty very firmly,Misty same pose smiles and tender Ash’s hairs)..i don’t want to hear any bit of it from you sweetie unless you know is casual discussions and all not privately(both giggle at each other same pose)..please dear please not this just not even in casual discussions try not to say that word legend Mist cause you know your level and mine and anyone can get my level and then there’s no meaning in that word as i told you friendship doesn’t compare the concerned subjects and Mist you may come up to my level and so on but except everyone you will cause my Mist is just me my sweet Mist flower(hugs Misty very firmly,Misty smiles and tenders Ash’s hairs,few moments later)..so you may or may not doesn’t matter you will know my bunch atleast inside out may be Goldy will get defected to be my pokemon(both laugh) saving you(both laugh) and that brat Jellicent too beware of ghostly bonhomies you know my current public image says i’m a Gengar(both laugh) that you can say in public cause Gengar doesn’t know anything cause none of these words they know at all(all laugh) yet they stay with only one their whole lives and their carefree nature hum(both giggle at each other then hugs each other very firmly smiling) but rest may not cause like you still are a bit different to me in your present existence in this form hence both our troubles that beyond spouses and bodies we can’t so easily unify with each other which we want all time(both smile at each other same pose,few moments later)..so my sweet Mist flower should only beam and play around with me and her bunch(both hug each other very firmly smiling)..i feel hurt when i see the so sweet face of my sweet Mist flower like that when she says those things the words cause my sweetie just can’t express that she’s a sweetly ponytailed sweet Gyarados(both giggle at each other same pose) don’t say those when you and me it’s jut HUMAN,remember Trace and Scyther battling(both laugh)..man hhardly came away from being sent to jail(both laugh)..NO!IT’S INHUMAN(both laugh)..some jackal that is(both laugh)..me and my Mist pokemon skill whatever nothing matters cause all in my my soul culminates in my soul me my sweet Mist flower(both smile at each other and hug each other very firmly,few moments later),and just say how you’ve fondled Gyarados each day for 4 years so that i can contemplate on my eternally sweet Mist flower(both laugh)..and it’s about them Mist you know those questions(both laugh)..just letting them be me that’s all and no that’s only all cause they are Chu,Butterfree,Pidgeot,Bulbasaur,Squirtle,Kingler,Charizard(both laugh),Abmasnow,Mewostic,Whimsicott(both laugh),Tauros,Talonflame(both laugh),Emboar(both laugh),Professor MUK(both laugh),Metagross,Buzzwole(both laugh),Pangoro(both laugh),Togedemaru(both laugh),Heliolisk(both laugh),Primape,Noctowl,SNORLAX(both laugh) that brat is something true in-born brat(both laugh),Floatzel,Sharpedo,MARSHADOW(both laugh) what an introduction it was Mist to ghostly life and Tracey life(botth laugh) still after him will be in each life(both laugh),Celebi(both laugh),Pelipper(both laugh),Hawlucha(both laugh),Lapras(both smile at each other),Heracross(both laugh),Bayleaf,Feraligator(both laugh) anything else(both laugh) i always told you brat and your choised travel companions to not be serious(both burst into laughter) this pest is something,Magearna,Banette(both laugh),Beeheeyem(both laugh),TYRAniTAR(both laugh),Madgaleo(both laugh) just my Solgy(both laugh),Donphan,Unown(both laugh),Claydol(both laugh),Typhlosion(both laugh),Scrafty(both laugh) in a family sorrow and joy comes in cycles like a dual type always sad and happy i’m dual am i not your family(both burst into laughter) family schism specialist(both laugh)..utter brat..

Ash(hugging Misty,laugh) : "forever and ever i'll be yours even if i just kill you now"
Misty(hugging Ash,laugh) : "i know this from my very own soul that you're being me just right now"
Ash(same pose,laugh) : "i'll send you to heaven staying at hell and hell will be heaven for me

Ash(smile) : " 'gotcha,but no we'll have to go to Lillie and Gary first indeed"
Misty(thoughtfull) : "surely,you know she and i,as much we fought in the childhood,the much warmth we share now,beside i was and still is in a way her role model and that's why she changed,you know she was the most desperate among us.."
Ash(dissapointed) : "ya,and that's precisely was my target and naturally only she hasn't quite yet come back to her own,and Gary i know whom she dated throughout her life as Daisy as well as i told you my processes and Trace we both know just a sly fox(both laugh) and Gary too i know not once anyone except Lillie since 16 and 16-18 was same reason why Lillie was like that all illusion personal loss and thus an cover and illusion same for Daisy’s sentiments(laugh)..the jackal had a hard time for 14 years(laugh)..3 realtions 2 serious 1 advanced to absolute volcano off(laugh) that too all since 15 to 34,17 damn years for 3 realtions(laugh) similarly extracted the news without namecalls(laugh) rest the jackal himself did(laugh) and 2 serious first one more advanced since school 15 to 22 was travel companions as well but in the midlle all those devastation was there as well as two travels for gyms and so on and when our Dase flower was 22 i was 15 didn’t start my journey yet(laugh) and she married at the age of 41(laugh) then 2 in 10 years the serious one was the 2nd was from 26 to 30(laugh) in-between still trusted the most cunning fox to handle her Gyagadosy baby and manage the gym realizable the illusion and jackal as usual most dumb fox(laugh) then another from 33-34 damn brat(laugh) 34 to 41 is 7 damn years and then married jackal and jackal we all know just THE one one most dumb jackal(laugh) then our Brocko man(laugh) 2 relations only,a gym leaders from Kanto itself another at college when i sweared the hell out of that brat it was directed to the brat not Brock i was in illusion so the trouble and then only the first was serious cause he was gym leader still less naive still(laugh) from 20 to 23 during our Orange stay broke-up,and then our Viol flower not once anyone except Brock but we all know about it(laugh) cause we know Violet too well too totally transparent and simple(laugh) then finally there was our Lillie wig(laugh) and she since 14 till 32 for 18 years 10 relations 5 serious 4 advanced and she married at the age of 36,4 years later, then sweet sweet Gary(laugh) some crushes and hangouts and so on too type specified and too much intellectual and outragious once they wanted to be personal in talks(laugh) a brat jumped but that was it really for him that brat was a crush and the viseversa but that took the illusion off from my sweet bro..and my Mist flower devoured me up totally first sight and then i didn’t call her from her own phone so a few brats were around 2 then and there understood they were in illusion another just got Salamenced(laugh) that brat is too fond of me now wants to be Gengar and his soulmate doesn’t hence was complaing to me(laugh) recorded my conversation on how to tame intruding Palkias and bing human-Gengar(laugh) loaths you now cause of the illusion(laugh) hence at last fed you the card that you should’ve jumped into Unova and Kalos and so on says all family drama all sisters pawned the lesser half you didn’t want to so Daisy forced 3 to pawn on me(burst into laughter)..and Lillie’s 10 were 10 year illusion only for Mr Oak Mr Oak as Giratina says light is dark/dark is light/happy now Mr Oak but Mr Oak now why not so bright(both burst into laughter)..just my Giti(both laugh) master in momentary analysis of all changes and then there’s Zeraora from Kalos Mr Oak Mr Oak what are doing/Oh Mr Oak please help me i’m ruing/Mr Oak Mr Oak why a Zeraora is a pokemon(both burst into laughter)/tell me now Mr Oak don’t you know else you’ll bemoan(both burst into laughter)..if a new person or pokemon goes to any of my brats we see new import(both burst into laughter) what’s thy chosen name(both burst into laughter)..and Ultranercozma says too many types why not each then the mix in the end again start from zero just like sleep and with your beau your trip is there ever that perfect fix(both burst into laughter)..my Cozy sweetie(both burst into laughter)..so you understand Mist about my nature(both laugh)..but nothing is full without my sweet Mist wife(both smiles at each other)..and no i did go too far, maybe i should call her won’t sleep i guess though Gary was more than happy.."
Misty(smile) : "its ok dear,no need to disturb them today again,we'll be there just let the sun rise for(laugh) those choised brats as well(both laugh).."
Ash(laugh) : "yeah i surely have a few works left here before i can go to Orange"
Misty(laugh) : "So true.Man,you gave all of us a real scare,and when are you going to send your acceptance for the Hall of Fame position?"
Ash(tired) : "Ah! Mist,all in good times and there’s so much more to talk about that isn’t so easy please dear not now,i'm too tired want to sleep in your arms"
Misty(smile) : "so do i,Ash."
Ash(excited): "but you know what,i've never thought before,but i guess today i helped to make a phrase easier for me and may be many as well"
Misty(smirk,hugging Ash) : "what is it that you're doing behind me,hum,Ash Ketchum?"
Ash(laugh) : "relax Mist Ketchum(both smile),i feared i'll have go down far far more"
Misty(frown) : "Ash it's not funny you know,you were self mortifying yourself,no matter your true motives and intentions"
Ash(hugging Misty) : "perfect time"
Misty(surprized) : "huh?!?"
Ash(smile and hugging Misty) : "All this trouble was taken up to pick up my flower from the Cerulian Frowers.Happy now?"
Misty(laugh) : "it's too used everywhere actually,we've rather grown tired with just about anybody spitting this one out anywhere,they may have a few songs as well"
Ash(smiling and immitating one of the Cerulian Flowers songs from the City) :
"the beautiful flowers from Cerulian Gym/the flowers that of which i always dream/Dase,Viol,MIST(tenders Misty,Misty laughs) and Lil/all or one(hugs Misty very firmly,Misty laughs)/just bring me some/give my heart the perfect heal"
Misty(smirk,scoff) : "Ash, it's not exactly pleasing if you were there"
Ash(smiling) : "hey,i was there remember,i guess i also was in this body as well to see the fun..(laugh)..besides we'll be back to the gym anyway"
Misty(smile) : "you would've been killed picking up fights with just about everybody in the crowd"
Ash(laugh) : "i guess i would've.but i still have a complain to make"
Misty(frown) : "what is it?"
Ash(laughing) : "that my flower never described herself formally to me AFTER her date"
Misty(smile&hug) : "Mrs. Misty Waterflower Ketchum.Happy now?"
Ash(smile and gives Misty a Ring fetched from Cerulian while he was out to meet professor Oak..) : "VERY"
Misty(smile and wonder) : "Ah!Ash..this is..that's what made you so return so late.."
Ash(smiles and fits the ring into Misty's Finger) : "ya,Talonflame you saw(finishes the fitting),Welcome to the Ketchum Family Ms. Misty Waterflower for the umpteenth time(smile)"
Misty(smile,hug Ash) : "my pleasure once more"
(both hug for a few moments)
Misty(smile) : "how's Cerulian?and which one?and actually you went there before you went to the Lab,right that's why 'don't call anybody till i return'..hum?.."
Ash(laugh) : "right.Cerulian is yet to come into terms with the fact that the young flower dream could stay depressed for more than 3 years and then suddenly a prince sorry a h.. b..(Misty shakes her head and and frowns)..(laugh)..no Mist,please otherwise i won’t be able to describe the best comedy i ever saw..(Misty sighs shakes her head and laughs)..so this brat comes and does his magic to get the flower to fly all by herself to him,i might've been killed today had it not been for Greninja,by luck i had her today."
Misty(concerned) : "they mobbed you in the shop?"
Ash(laugh) : "i went to Police Station straight away at 22:20,gave my identity,said i wanted a good amount of protection that too very quickly else if there's a shoplifting in Mr Keller's shop 3 blocks to the west,Waterpolo Crossing,red gem road,pearl house building 4th floor,right side 1st shop,then don't sue me,to which the Officer warmly complied at 22:50,shop at 23:10,but as usual the the people tried to mob me even at midnight as Cerulian doesn’t sleep(laugh) on the charge that i was the one indeed to break the heart of the youngest flower first then humiliated her in public second and then tried to kidnap her,forcing her to leave Cerulian for Elite 4 HQ at Indigo Platue,Kanto two days ago third-this as is doing the rounds in local TVs,people demand answers,but the problem is before this news could spread upto here at my home,which if happened,they would've seen some great games with the whole Oak Lab Pokemons,the threat of which prevents a single one of them ever trying to break into Pallet as Gary himself is authorized to do that,anyhow the press had a bigger reason to not try to mingle with me,now that i had given them a bigger puzzle to solve by declining the Hall of Fame(bursts into laughter)No,please let me finish,this is the best piece of comedy i've seen or heard or read ever.so they think now this new pest to the whole mass and especially Cerulian city being his target is a bit depressed,then our flower has indeed just trodden over this godforsaken brat once and for all and he's defeated once and for all and depressed lost his mojo wants to resign..(bursts into laughter)..just bear with me Mist..(laugh)...but then appolocalypse approaches- suddenly that brat appears off the blue/in all smiles with his sinister crew/he gets to a shop as if to get his due/suddenly he declares a ring for his beau(bursts into more laughter,release Greninja,then bursts into even more laughter)
Misty(laughing) : "Ash,you've really become a public meance,Greninja stop that(Greninja tries to stand on one toe Finger on top of Misty's then she join Ash in fun)Ash,then what happened"
Ash(in tears from laughter,calls back Greninja) : "oh..what a night,yeah right,i'm telling you please be patient,this is too funny"
Misty(laugh) : "Ash.."
Ash(laughing) : "what a night this comrades Cerulian/we must very first get rid of this evil king demon/Comrads let's unite and challenge to this man/force him to show what he hides below his tan..(again laugh)oh! man..Please,Mist,you just need to be patient.."
Misty(bit concerned) : "i'm Ash,but you should stop being too reckless you see,and you only had 3 pokemons with you no matter what they can do you were in physical danger that they can’t help”
Ash(laugh) : "right i will be cautious later;now back to this,the officers try to tell them that he's just here to buy a ring and go but a few young people weren't going to listen so i had to release Greninja and tell them if they so wishes they bear witness to the ring i select and let us go outside and deal this matter like gentlemen,i challenge 50 people against Greninja all at once..that’s cause more the number more the illusion over my abilities and anyway thats Ghostradarkarrigussonor best 70 to 80 Moltress and a Hydroquastorporus best with me together and each with fininitely more intelligence(laugh,Misty sighs and tenders Ash’s hairs)...and Mist they know about infinitely many circles around me with temporal time limit given according to my mental feelings and thus even if a handshakes crosses the limit with me being very uncomfortable that’s good night as Giti was with me all time invisible as was Cozy as in that state they can stay for 10 to 12 hours(laugh) only police knew my GiraCozma’s presence i told them they are safe as well no matter what the possible mob does just get rid of the guns and all(laugh,Misty concerned tenders Ash’s hairs)..no Mist Giti can go one level beyond Ghostradarkarrigussonor and Cozy two(laugh) and no you think they were tired after all they had to do today actually these serious works gets them bored so they become more incensed and hence if needed will become most jovial and thus only it never matters(laugh,Misty hugs Ash firmly with concern)..no,sweetie it’s ok,i was too excited i will be cautious later,hum,now my sweet flower should beam at me..(Ash hugs Misty very firmly then both smile at each other)..right,anyway,Giti was invisible and surrounded me to gauge my mental states to calculate the circle breachs which were told to them to be a feet and then the adjustments this is 1 feet circle surrounding me they were taught these after that Unovan bratting ever took them in innumerable civil places(laugh,Misty keeps tendering Ash’s hairs and smiles)..then Giti was doing that to get rid of the daggers cause they were sudden and all then had Cozy as out layer and she provided a dragonic mask this is incredible cause i was in physical body totally sane and what those two were doing this is impossible below atleast Glytsohapmemrotusitel the 3rd psychic legend in strength list(laugh) and these were my protection and police was still there but anyway,now the bet is they win i won't buy the ring if i do,they let me take the ring and facilitate me and my fiancee to a ceremony here and celebrate our engagement officially,to which a few said 50 on one,no matter who he is none can disrespect Cerulian like he has,some said no he has come up with a plan-he could electrocute the whole ocean at his leasure,some said he can move the whole police force at will and release Pewter and Viridan Forces too on us,some said why bother he has 107 dreaded demons himself making 107(laugh,Misty sighs and continues to tender Ash’s hairs) but in the meantime that was bought i placed the order(burst into lughater,Misty laughs as well),then i told them what is it that they have a problem with,calm down and lets talk.they said they suspect due to me,the famous gym is now closed and the Sensational Four all have left the city and they are not happy about it,to which i said what they want the Sisters or the performance which totally confused them and in the meantime i delt with the shop..laugh..what a night this comrad Cerulians..(laugh)..anyhow..now then some said what are you trying to imply,some said this is public disrespect,some women said it's gender bias,some reasoned heads said he has got a point,in the meantime i selected the ring(another burst of laughter)..oh!i'll be barely able to forget this ever..sorry Mist,but please.."
Misty(laugh) : "it's ok Ash, you've become a bit of a storyteller,i'm enjoying.continue"
Ash(laughing) : "so,anyhow they said they want the Gym to run again and the sisters to return,to which i said the Gym Leader was overworking and had the Frontier Symbol attached as well,then just probably brunt out a bit, holidaying now to get over the exhaustion and i have only respect for her and nothing else and she wasn’t behaving properly as i was told so i just wanted to teach her a lesson and i just thought that would help to lighten her mood a bit and so on...then they said no you intentionally did it and you were the very cause of her depression and so on to which i just scoffed that they are disrespecting my fiancee for whom i’m buying a ring from their very own city itself..this got them dumbfounded and bought me more time for the shop...but then they tried to make a comeback saying i indeed was the one who abducted all the four sisters no matter what i say and may be my fiancee is from among them itself whom i’ve threatned to marry me or..laugh..may be i’ve threatened all of them to marry me..laugh..what a night this..anyhow..this was my exact trap,i just said they themselves will come to know whether it’s true or not if only they first even allow me to get ring otherwise i won’t be able to marry anyone let alone them and mostly if i don’t get married at all then none will come to know the truth anyway as both me and the sisters will only accuse each other and none will get the truth but if i’m getting married to my fiancee who isn’t from among them..laugh..(Misty and Ash both point to Misty’s ring and hug each other laughing)... now I accuse Cerulians for mobbing up on me they will only harm themselves cause Elite 4 may cancel the Gym given that a local man like me who was from Pallet which is adjacent to Cerulian gets mobbed by almost hometown people..um,actually hometown(laugh,Misty smirks and tenders Ash).. and the Gym leader was not behaving well...and then they’ll come to themselves anyway as the Sisters would want to and have visit their home anyway,as they are still official gym leaders and even if there’s any procedure regarding the Gym,atleast one has to physically appear in sane state or send their confident..and besides even if they are right why would they want to buy a ring from their very own City where stars like them has bought from each ornament shop since childhood and moreover if i’m to appease them i could bring a ring from anywhere else or just could order it,why would i myself even step foot in Cerulian knowing people here would be incensed with me..so this long thought of thoughts(both bursts into laughter)...got them so confused,i finally put the ultimate knail in the coffin by saying that the reality is that the Sensational Sisters have their own lives and they must understand that no matter how electrifying darling of masses they were at the end of the day they have to settle down and have a nice family,and whether their very own home Citi’s beloved fans won’t consider them for even this bit..(laugh)..this sentimental attack totally deflated them and then i just continued to gibberish to which i said that it's all normal and they just need to
be calm and patient and the sisters has to visit their home sometimes they have to and they'll
be back soon,then they said why are you here,some said whom are you getting engaged to,and so on,to which i said,Cerulian is world famous for the diamons and precious stones,where else would i go to except for here,to which they mellowed down a bit,but some said you could’ve still ordered it,to which i said would my fiancee be happy if i was afraid of the same people who adored me despite me humiliating their own Gym leader and clapped for my funny antics,they just fell down from heaven then but then they said alright now that you're here show us a few tricks,to which i said if Cerulian formally invites me,i'll be most grateful to come but tonight i've to go back with this ring to my fiancee and if they hold me up and delay that, Cerulians will not be as appreciated as much their ring,to which they did mellow down finally and then they said alright but we won't let you
go without atleast a few tricks from Greninja,its pretty rare that a Cerulian has a Greninja as it’s only found naturally in Kalos and only as starter in Unova..rhymes ain’t it?(both bursts into laughter)...anyway,to which i had to oblige and Greninja showed a few balance tricks and all including the one she was trying to perform on your head,and then finally they were pleased but didn’t yet budge saying whom did you defeat for your second gym badge here,which they knew which i said it was Ms Daisy Waterflower(both laughs) and her Dewgong one on one as she compassionately agreed to as i was just starting and but i had my Pikachu then as the whole world knows and managed to satisfy her enough so hand me the badge and i’m eternally greatfull to her for that cause till then i really wasn’t good enough but after this i got really straightened up as she also gave me some advises as i was a mere 16 year old then and i truely have remembered her as a big sister since then and that’s exactly why it felt bad when i heard the current Gym Leader’s condition so just helped but i knew a battle might’ve made her either more proud or more depressed i just resorted to have fun...this term of emotional discourse makes them to fondle me almost(both bursts into laughter) so i also got my ring and then they said i'll have to promise them that i'll return here and have a pokemon show or battle or exhibition,to which i said as i would love to come but they must invite me formally via Kanto Elite 4 otherwise i will only be mobbed like i have been now and that won't be helpful to anybody to which finally they budged and allowed me to leave properly,and then i went to Oak Lab at 12:00 and then Gary's extended Lab side then back to Oak Lab and finally home only to see Mime is upto her dirty tricks with me(both laugh)..all thses cause AH!so Mistyvious!(laugh).."
Misty(smirk,lightly smacking Ash’s head) : "Mistyvious hum?..(Ash laughs hugging Misty,laugh)Ash,quite a mess you're creating now wherever you're..going,and please don't roam around unprotected like this..please,you’ve a family.."
Ash(hugging Misty,smile) : “so sweet is my flower’s touch..(Misty laughs and smacks a bit harder)..um,ok,ok,lightly(both laughs)..and i’m eternally Mistyvious(both giggle,Misty smirks and about to smack his head again)..ok,ok..no more..um perpetually lightly..(both bursts into laughter hugging each other firmly)...”
Misty(laughing) : “Ash,they’ll eventually mob you for abducting me(both bursts into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : "i will say you’re lucky i didn’t marry her on that battle day itself(both laugh) i so much wanted to propose you then and there hence the gloves(laugh,Misty smirks and tenders Ash’s cheeks)..no Mist,Cerulian is Cerulian to me ever a funny place,i wouldn't have been able to come out of it so easily had i not had a water pokemon..so today's heroine is indeed Greninja"
Misty(laugh) : "after this mayhem you went to patch up with your family?"
Ash(laugh) : "exactly"
Misty(laugh) : "and may i hear a bit from there,my sweet daring bee(Ash giggles,Misty smirks),i know the result but how did you calm them down?"
Ash(smile) : "Mist,i'm in this Bash Cerulian..sorry(Misty bursts into laughter)..mood now,i'm dictating my movements back at the Lab comedy style,please bear with me."
Misty(laugh) : "go on stand up"
Ash(laugh) : "so as soon as Daisy sees me.."you b..what were you insinuating(laugh,Misty shakes her head and then laughs),you've given my baby Mist a bluff and threatened her to be with you
and you even doubt you own friend Tracey..so on,so on,so on..to which i said look if you were ever suspecting Tracey,you'd want to see who far he can walk with you..which didn’t please our DaisyDevil(Misty bursts into laughter)..laugh..sorry..Daisyl at all(burst into laughter,Misty uncontrollably laughs)..DaisyDaisyl(both laugh even more)..in the mean time the gentleman-fox(Misty bursts into laughter) came out to have a gauge only to eat a death glare from Daisy,so the poor thing wasn't of much help,as usual..(Misty again bursts into laughter)..then Daisy mellowed down but told me to go back home and ATLEAST,ATLEAST not to cheat on you the on the very first night,as if i cheated on someone with someone,whom i cheated to be with someone,who was infact the one whom i first cheated before i cheated someons...laugh..um,please Mist,i'm sorry but i can't help,blame Cerulian Mob for that.."
Misty(laugh) : "i'm waiting to smack you again(both laugh).."
Ash(laughing) : "please(both laugh)..anyhow,next up Gary..man,you know as a former champion among bad boys i can't believe you'd ever beat me..to which i said the same thing that i needed genuinity..which hopefully appeased the devil..then Lillie..well its sad but i can't help,she started with calling me a b...,then proceeded to state that i had indeed opened the pandora's box,but as
i said i know the contents as well,got kinda lost but again came back that it still was opened and that too in front of everyone,then as i couldn't play any new hands she continuted her victory lap to declare her supreme realtion with you paused to insult me again for leaving you for roads.. s...,and brilliantly migrated to the next part by confessing her feelings to Gary subtly hinting where i stood with you compared to Gary's adoration to her,as if the whole world never knew before,in the meantime i gave the same logic and tried my best for the sake of her future,and that she was my sister-in-law and all which she took these as a trick to come into terms that she countered by saying i'll still leave you,i should’t dare to nickname you and she’ll never be my relation and so on,which i again countered by the old card of future but also rather firmly told her if i can’t nickname you i’ll mention you as my wife which off course our Delil flower didn’t Lil up to at all(Misty laughs) but had to submit to looking at my determination even in that position without much irritation anyhow these all finally tamed the lioness but still she pawed me finally by giving the marching orders remining me once more how she’s much higher in majesty to allow me to distort her name in sentimental terms which i hapily obliged to save my life feeding her Gary lion’s name to her so that the devil finally calms down but all this was only to enter the lion's mouth itself just outside the door who barked that his grandpa was waiting for his prey and i was to be sent there but he growled in such a sweet and polite way that you couldn't help but agree...laugh..what a night this comrads Cerulian..laugh..won’t forget it through all hells,anyhow,this was round 2..
Misty(sigh) : "Ash, you've truely surpassed all expectations really."
Ash(smiling) : "all honoured coming from my all sweet Mist,who ever thought ‘my Ash’ was too sweet to talk sweet..laugh(Misty bursts into laughter)..anyway 3rd round started and the old hen’s den who was rather easy to handle but beaked me by questioning my head off as to how i knew the secret truths and what are the levels of my and your special pokemons like Gyarados and Golduck and so on as if he is desperate for Team Rocket 2..laugh(Misty sighs and then laughs)..anyway this questioning was exactly the anticlimax of the early night Cerulian Fiasco,so it bored me to death,i somehow managed to lick his feet long enough to get out of there safely without having to transfer my pokemons this very night,which is why i had to be extra careful with the old bear..laugh..round 3 completes..
Misty(laugh) : "carry on,i'm sending your name to stand-up comedy before Oranges"
Ash(laugh) : "you'll save me from battling then too finally,thank you sweetie(tenders Misty’s cheeks,Misty bursts into laughter)..anyhow round 4,now as i was coming out I thought TraleyDaivyl(Misty bursts into laughter) must be having fun now and i'm on my first night haven't even been able to give the ring to my flower and this bonehead is in the Orange of of Oranges and since Oranges with his Daisyllish flovil(Misty bursts into laughter) while pestering me since Oranges whenever i got alone with my sweet cherished Mist flower,which made my blood absolutely boil to the 8th hell and i told Giti to fetch the god damn brat immediately,which he tickly complied by getting into the dubnut’s head and tickling him there..laugh(Misty bursts into laughter and shakes her head)..and Trace didn't know which side to sail to only managing to fire the "why drag all else" bullet which by now became so boring that i shot back a cannonball saying i needed to check our chemistry before i could join her in a parade,which he wickedly shielded saying they won't be able to match my partner but they would follow behind,which puzzled me as i couldn't instantly come up with an attack having to resort to embrace it out option,so the gentleman-looking-most-cunning fox(Misty bursts into laughter) found out a way to make the honours even and then straight from devil's den none other than our most honoured devil a sort of Daisyl emerged(laugh,Misty bursts into laughter) having followed her soulmate all the way as the wisdom nut i was ferrying around earlier,having bought it and now to apply it on me..and she broke the ground by declaring she had eavesdropped,which made me sigh even in that situation as if i didn't know but fortunately the wicked fox was utterly defeated much to my merriment,Daisy showed how compassionate she was by caring to call me not by my surname but hearing my name from Daisy the first time in my damned life was if not the straight road to heaven then i'm sure i'll be doomed to hell.i realized the full trick as she had to oblige in front of my family and future card just like her younger lioness earlier and then took a wicked turn copied betterly from the book of her cunning soulmate by trying to create a little ripple effect in my calm emotional water surface by stating how devoted her little sis has been despite me being a f.. man-b..(Misty frowns) sorry again,and then as she basked in the glory of her impending victory,she bit me by implying i may again go back to any wh..any given day but may i atleast divorce properly and make her baby sis suffer less..i again just played my family and future card this time dragging Tracey right into this with me as i could see that wicked-gentleman standing there with a long face whole time thinking of the final attack that'll finally bury me for good,anyhow Daisy didn't think that the sentiment card can be handled for long so she launched her final attacked giving me the marching orders specifically mentioning to go back only to home with the details of the rout and not to any waiting b..,which i would've had she not mentioned that and especially the rout...laugh..what a night...i need a moment"
Misty(sigh) : "and you had our engagement ring in your pocket?"
Ash(smiling,tendering Misty’s cheeks) : "right.anyway,she also tried to drag Tracey to return with her as she suspected i was indeed a terrible influence over her cherished gentleman as she saw Trace
throughout was rather ungentlemanly naïve(Misty sighs,Ash laughs),anyhow the wicked-gentleman all along thought of a plan and finally sold me the sketch card that he promised in earlier which i had to retort with a solemn concern that he needs to extend my contract here at the Lab,which he also bypassed by joking about my grand future(both smile and then laugh) and cunningly showing that how gentleman like i should be in that regard which is the true testament why the sly-buffoon indeed was the soulmate of DaisyDevil..laugh(Misty laughs)..sorry..anyhow,the dumb-looking-ever-conniving-jackle(Misty laughs) yet came back saying i should call from Brock to God himself as Viol herself to Brock agian to the path of God(laugh,Misty burst into laughter) by myself to plead mercy for my terribly unbearable sins which i just about sidestepped by saying it's too late at night and then finally as i was coming back i couldn't help but to again set Giti on Trace and snatch his phone away by creating illusions long enough for me to search up Brock and send a text that "Tracey Skechum,Ash's Husband"(Misty sighs) and then deleted the copy and No don't get so surprized i'm coming in terms with it..let the devils wake up tomorrow and massacre among themselves over me,i told them i’ll myself leave their baby sis if they want legal procedure but the problem as soon as i leave you,they know what happens as i myself handed them you prescription..No Mist,it was needed..the bufoons must know that the personal life they so cherish also applies to their baby sis no matter who she becomes,why would i take all the blame myself when my sweetie herself always asked me to continue and finish my journey first then she comes and my sweet doll was cheated on her sweetness..(hugging Misty very firmly)..”
Misty(hugging Ash firmly) : “Ash,please,don’t get so excited all the time sweetie,they’re our family,no need to be so harsh..and no no legal procedure will take place..and i’m only happy that you told them about my plight cause i didn’t tell them myself and had to..it’s ok dear..just stay with me and i’ll handle them and no they won’t insult me for you..please..”
Ash(whinning) : “then also they should let me some peace and quite with MY WIFE in PINKEN ISLANDS FOR TWO WEEKS..unless they agree...those.."
Misty(sigh) : "Ash,you're not at all mentally well.."
Ash(stressed) : " 'course i'm not,but(grim)none is letting me to solve the problem"
Misty(scowl and frown,stern voice) : "Ash,we can't live alone and enjoy and let our family suffer like this.."
Ash(grim) : "Mist,please,i beg of of you,please.I NEED YOU alone with me for atleast a week at a secluded place as soon as possible,else i'll have to go Henry Care to get my mind checked which i won't be doing at all"
Misty(tendering Ash) : "dear,i understand your pain,let me handle the relatives and friends from tomorrow ok?"
Ash(smile) : "of course,but i don't want my wife to be insulted due to me,if any clown try to get their dirty hands on.." 
Misty(hugging Ash,deep breath) : "Ash!enough is enough,let them go and don't create any more fuss,i'll go alone tomorrow.."
Ash(hugging Misty) : "and they'll insult you on your choice the first day because some f.. b.. couldn’t care to come back from Unova to his dear..(Misty tries to stop Ash)..No let me finish,please(Misty sighs deep breath),i need to vent it out,and some other f.. thought it's so easy for
Ash Ketchum to become the Prince of Kalos and get his face dirty by an eternal s.. who cheated on our friendship that she feigned for 2 years and now's my beau made of stool and pus and i have to lick and smell that cough and urine in public and.."
Misty(scream,stern) : "Ash! your with you wife..for God's sake..."
Ash(still whinning) : "yeah,to be which took me so long cause i was a godforsaken brat but it would've been easier for me if i wasn't entirely forsaken by people back at home here except Gary,so i'm a playboy,i get insulted on the way while carrying the engagement ring that i'll give a ring and then leave my wife and enjoy some wh.."
Misty(tears,hugging Ash) : "you'll make me cry,you want that so badly don't you?"
Ash(hugging Misty) : "um..sorry Mist..your just.."
Misty(hugging Ash) : "Ash,i understand the pain you went through and your self denial didn't
help it either,i did call Brock myself and told him of our impending engagement.."
Ash(scoff) : "and he had some choised words indeed i guess.."
Misty(firmly) : "whatever,you know who he is and why he is so important to both of us along with Tracey"
Ash(frown) : "yeah,sure for a du..nah enough swearing for a day"
Misty(smile) : "that's my sweet 'lil bee,now come here(opening her arms)"
Ash(hugging Misty) : "you're not going anywhere tomorrow morning except for Lillie,Gary is not an infatuated fool like the other two mu.. and he'll take care of dumb stunts himself.."
Misty(hugging and patting Ash) : "Ash,please,i'll go to all the places,and manage it,No,they can't think and say whatever they want about my husband either,i'll announce my engagement to the press myself"
Ash(hugging Misty firmly) : "but make sure they don't disturb us at my home or at the Lab,Pallet
has many open places,they can mob me all they what there,but if they have one word to say about you or mob you or try to get us at my home or Lab or you,and most importantly if my Mist is in direct physical danger,i'll empty all my pokemons on them and won't take any responsibility for any kind of repurcussions..(Ash's phone rings)..here here,sure the gay dumbnut is infatuated too much today..."
[phonecall:
Tracey(concerned) : "Ash.."
Ash(stern) : "Trace,please i beg of you don't act like an infatu..."(Misty snatches the phone away)
Misty(frown) : "enough Ash,let me handle(keeps Ash away)"
Ash(self) : "if these to..nah! i'm only jeopardizing my time with Mist"
Misty(solemn) : "Trace,I know what he did,what are you so upset about?Ash isn't exactly in a good mental state ok,he deserves to be alone at least on his first night with his wife when he already has done what he could,just leave him alone"
Tracey(concerned) : "Misty,i understand he's stressed but i'm suggesting that you handle the relations and keep him away from people in general as well ok?"
Misty : "yeah Trace,thanks and that's exactly what i'm doing,did Brock ring you back?"
Ash(frown) : "the dumb b.."
Misty(frown) : "Ash i'm talking.go to bed(Ash sits down on his looking at Greninja’s pokeball which is empty Greninja is outside somehwere else with Sableye and Gengar and Pikachu) and stop thinking what you're."
Tracey(sigh) : "Yes,he called and he has has his doubts over Ash's intentions which i only confirmed him to be as good as possible for an honest and self dignified man as he ever is"
Misty(concerned) : "yeah,i'm calling him immediately,will that be ok?"
Tracey(solemn) : "i don't think it's a trouble,with Ash on fire not much of tonight is left,and here we're all awake, that's only Me and Dase"
Misty(solemn) : "ok just hold on for a minute ok?Ash,take my phone ring Brock while i'm talking with Dase,Please do as i say,and be polite he has Violet with him,now go ahead please,ya Trace,give Dase the phone"
------------
Ash(trying to find Brock,self) : "the f.. mu.. “
Brock(concerned) : "Misty.."
Ash(laugh) : "aren’t you already dumped?(bursts into laughter)"
Brock(bit puzzled) : "..Ash..."
Ash(laugh) : "Mr Ketchum first,i’ve killed Misty second,using her phone to fool you,third i’ve chopped her body into.."
Brock(sigh,stern) : “Ash,you’ve crossed all limits,who do you think you’ve..”
Ash(laugh) : "Playboy..don’t you know that honey.."
Brock(very agitated,scream) : "Ash, don't get me started ok,you know very well what antics you
pulled on me that day.."
Ash(solemn) : "yeah,the aftermath too yeah,i realize,well i can be frank to you,but Violet.."
Violet(scream) : “you b.. you’ve abducted my baby sis and you f.. b.. you’re threatening my Brock now you b..”
Ash(solemn) : “well um..(laugh)you won’t recognize your baby sis anymore though(bursts into laughter)...”
Violet(crying) : “you f.. brat,where’s my Mist,(uncontrollably cries,scream)..you b..”(Brock Controls her)
Brock(sigh) : “Ash,what are you upto?”
Ash(bursts into laughter) : “hovering around from one to another for cough and spit(laughs even more)”
Brock(stern) : “Ash,no matter how much Misty may cherish you,we’re her family and we atleast have the right to know whether her fiancee atleast have the minimum courtsey to speak peoperly with us or not..”
Ash(solemn) : “WIFE not fiancee anyway,Brock,I can’t cherish Mist right?”
Brock(solemn) : “that’s past according to your very own language”
Ash(laugh) : “past?just two things Brock,i guess we can continue this call for a pretty long time and you won’t mind if i tell you to not do it in front of Violet cause she’ll get too emotional too eassily,are you with me on these two?”
Brock(solemn) : “yeah,just hold on a bit then..”
Ash(smile) : “most gladly”

..........
(Misty and Daisy)

Daisy(solemn) : “Mist,i just don’t understand this at all..”
Misty(solemn) : “Dase,his mental state isn’t alright at all and he is being too overprotective of me now,he wants to make up all his 14 years at one moment that he was away from me that’s all..”
Daisy(solemn) : “i get that bit Mist but he’s not helping himself at all and i atleast am still not clear of his intentions as simply due his own behaviour with Tracey,just totally opposite at every moment and totally confusing...”
Misty(sigh) : “Dase,please,anything but intensions,my Ash has atleast got rid of my depression no matter how and i know more than anybody that none else could’ve done that..”
Daisy(solemn) : “but Mist,i understand you still i mean this is very strange that’s all and yeah Trace has told me about those substances,i just want my baby Mist back to her self that’s all.
Misty(sigh) : “Dase,the self you’re talking about has always been Ash for me and you’ve now seen it yourself...you know now to upto where i went just to be that self without that particular cause and how abjectly i’ve failed..”
Daisy(solemn) : “Misty,i’m just afraid of the fact that even if all the allegations against him is totally bluff,his antics with us of all doesn’t give a picture of a stable man who can look after someone as in a family at least you may take your time..”
Misty(firmly) : “Dase you tell me,a lunatic infatuated man won’t take 6.5 hours constant from 11:00 to 17:30 to date me first within that time and we had huge quarrels where his language was way worse than what he used today morning and still forced me to take enough food twice third within that time my dosage of () wasn’t taken about which he knew too well and during the break-in collected all infoes regarding those and kept basic medicines and forced me to take that dosage in less amount and those medicines so that i can go on which means he didn’t want to let me go today no matter how long it took and inside he was totally lunatic in his yearning for me couldn’t wait for another day and date in fear of losing me but in the truest sense of that word third would never be so concerned about me that he would take me to the best doctor in the world immediately after proposal and you know where it was and what it takes to go there that quickly and then set things up there so much that none asked one thing to him or me and you know whole Safforn knows me very well for the show alone and only the main doctor discretely spoke with me in his presence and he was so frank there told her what was going on and we rather had a consultancy session and you’ve seen behind that prescription the best doctors here in locality are mentiond and yeah even in the copies both sides were done and this is cause in case i can’t travel that far and then lastly hand to my own family the presciption so that my treatment may not be hampered and my family gets to know all about my plight for future considerations no matter what he does with me and you know it’s not what you think it’s the so and so who might’ve started a new Team Rocket at Unova with all those rare legends is what bugs him and he told the doctor as well who treated him before and after his undercover and Sabrina recommended him to them and already within this little time has told me he might be needed at Unova and undercover though he will try not to but situation may arise shows still when it’s about pokemons ready to sacrifice me no matter how much he cherishes me all cause none else can help them at Unova and having all those badges he feels a moral responsibility as a few leaders there were light unto him in his dark days there.doesn’t all this answer your responsibility question?”
Daisy(solemn) : “Mist,i understand all,but you’ve always been..”
Misty(shivering voice) : “and still after all these he hasn’t right..(firmly)..you know what,he’s going to tell the same thing to Brock why don’t you two just connect to him,i’m telling you..and you too Trace,just clear up the confusion that what you saw first time 17 years back wasn’t a bluff...just call him and listen to what he has to say,i’ll be there as well..”
Daisy(bit concerned) : “Mist..”
..............................................................................................(all connects to Ash and the Misty also joins)...........................

Ash(laugh) : “Holy company,19 long years in making,so finally Brock all friends to all family and finally reunion ain’t it?”
Daisy(stern) : “Ketchum,you won’t have any if you miss this one no matter what Mist may do or think..”
Ash(smile) : “sure,Ketchum’s trying his best,but please bear with me and keep patience,this language is necessary for reasons you ony can understand if you’re patient,please,i beg of you,please,listen patiently...so here you see for you all there is this glaring,vivid,clear,distinctive thing exists which is THIS IDEA which never changed in 13 years so i don’t expect it to change in this conversation span and given the last 4 years but anyway,only for my wife’s sake i’m doing it and please allow me to express in clear terms my and Mist’s relationship now...so you see this beloved idea of your’s that Ash Ketchum was ever infatuated with Misty Waterflower no matter how much she truely cherished him and infact was JEALOUS of her and then further always USED her to FEED himself and now that finally it’s been in public gospel that this statement that Ash Ketchum has been found in every bed with every imaginable so and so is indeed a true statement,it perfectly validates your concern and suspision that truely Ash Ketchum never cared beyond infatuation about Misty Waterflower for 13 long years no matter what she did or took him to be so by virtue of that Ash Ketchum will still hold the same view on Misty Waterflower Ketchum,who is his wife now...in one word Brock,Daisy,Tracey...Mist was and still is a random so and so to me ever no matter of her views of me and my view hasn’t changed in 18 years no matter what,this i have to contradict isn’t it Brock?whether i cherish my wife or not?”
Brock(solemn) : “you wouldn’t have to if you had the minimum idea of how not to make enemies out of your friends”
Ash(frown) : “friends?why is it so Brock,that i’ve always found that i received more sympathy from my female friends and my male counterparts during my separation to my utter surprize and disdain?
Brock(solemn) : “well,you never were harsh to them for certain reasons,simple.”
(Ash bursts into laughter but Misty covers his mouth)
Misty(hugging Ash,sternly) : “none moves out of here and none retorts,whoever wants may politely continue and my husband will not give any proof to anyone regarding his alleged private life except his wife and he has already more than done that,if you still want you may continue and Ash,either you’ll be polite or it won’t be good for you”
Ash(hugging Misty quickly then letting her go) : “right Mist,right.so Brock(laugh)..i’m sure you’ve heard what happend to a few female friends of mine when they got up to my nerves and i’m sure you’ll comply if i don’t take advises from people on my personal life with my then-girlfriend-now-wife Mist if i don’t agree with them and clearly showing them that i don’t like their approaches to me despite them not desisting due to whatever,so i’m expecting answers here”
Brock(solemn) : “on the first account yes and also you would then see that there’s no gender bias there once similarity applies in behaviour and on the second account yes only if your ‘not desisting due to whatever’ is something that you can elaborate now via your answers to the central question here,so i’m expecting continuity here.”
Ash(smile) : "right,as i was saying,that’s great and i’m sorry if i was rude or is..but Brock you want to know why i did what i did after my separation or do you want to know whether i cherish my wife as much as she does or not or do you fevantly want to know whether i’m implying that my then-girlfriend’s presence to you was more important than her relationship with me so that i was taken as a support to the main centre and then as the support to the main centre wasn’t supporting so the endeavour to fix this up..which question is bugging you the most?
Daisy(strenly) : “Ketchum,what are you trying to imply on the third even today in front of Mist?”
Ash(solemn) : “that i don’t care a fig if my girlfriend is happy or not due to my activities if i know i’m honest to myself cause then my girlfriend truely hasn’t known my soul DESPITE 12 years and THUS she has no place for me no matter what.JUST THAT.”
Daisy(sternly,shivering,angry) : “you’re still saying it even now?”
Ash(solemn) : “yes and this is the first thing i told Mist last noon and this i’ll keep saying till my last breath that i didn’t care what was happening to her THEN cause otherwise it would’nt have been 5 seconds what to speak of 4 years.I had my different problems cause as i told you before i didn’t THEN know my relationship PERFECTLY with my Mist as i DO NOW and hence the result.”
Daisy(solemn) : “so basically then in your perception your wife would now take the place of your girlfriend?”
Ash(smile) : “exactly where you’re all wrong because what my girlfriend then didn’t know about me now she is my wife only because she most perfectly knows now and thus the trouble isn’t plausible.”
Misty(sternly) : “whatever my husband is saying is absolutely true,and that’s exactly why i also didn’t care about my then boyfriend cause he didn’t know my soul either but now both of us more than know it and thus we’re married.”
Brock(solemn) : “so Ash,this only proves once more your subsequent resentment with us when your patience according to you broke down but what exactly is presence?”
Ash(straight face) : “well,if people stay all the time and people stay not any time then surely there’s an idea that people who stays all the time is more well known thus more well understood subsequently more well trusted consequently more well befriended and finally more well present to all the observers.”
Daisy(angry) : “that means Ketchum you still don’t agree that you should’ve returned from Unova and not act like an egotistical so and so.”
Ash(smile) : “Daisy i perfectly understand your position and view but Trace knows best what my bunch was doing then and you yourself have been seeing them for more than a year now day in day out they needed me they forced me to be there all time else public would’ve been harmed may be you know the story of Glalie she would’ve destroyed your whole gym alone cause that was her impending level and none could stop them from that except me and thus i was concerned and then their condition was also mine my biggest mistake that i’ve so much regret for isn’t coming back or contacting it’s just that whenever i spoke with my Mist i couldn’t let go of my ego of being honest to my bunch so much that i took her life for granted and none except me knew what my bunch was doing none could cause i wasn’t cleared myself and hour after hour those realizations kept pouring upon me i got lost in that with my ego swelling even more as soon as i graped one realization but the very next decimated me and so i wasn’t well at all but my Mist was my resting place ever is and has been and i just didn’t pay any attention to this fact that no matter what i can’t set fire at my own living room myself and if fire is there i should jump in to extinguish it rather than trying to blow it away,Mist had troubles serious troubles cause she was working so much and that she still would cause her nature is such but then what i didn’t was to force her to spit out what her trouble was cause as you can see ever both of us intuitively knew that except each other there’s no life for us and no i’ve never been happy being at all beds as said else i wouldn’t have returned given Mist’s condition for sure if that is what i really wanted especially after 4 years of no contact...my Mist has been my wife since Kanto itself but i never knew properly and my 15 minutes in 10 days still would’ve been enough to not create that trouble if i didn’t want to talk about pokemons then or try to apprize her that i’m so sad without her or lecture her that i’m honest but being her husband that i’ve become as soon as i returned from Sinnoh in her mind atleast i should’ve listened to her not the other way around that’s my mistake for which she has suffered so much but there’s more to it that i was never told about her plight with the pestering and a few vultures hovering around here and there cause of my other most grave mistake of not giving her even a false ring but a few false trophies to show her matial status and who the husband was if the press wasn’t enough from other sources this news not once coming in distinct language is something i don’t understand cause Daisy you might not have liked me since day one neither has Violet nor Lillie but barring Gary cause he and Lillie was in same situation as that of me and Mist with the stardom but there were other people who are most perfect in dealing with these situations cause they aren’t emotional like me and Gary and they did like me cause it was 14 years relation with them. ”
Brock(solemn) : “so your concern is that i of all knowing you for 14 years and travelling with you in 5 regions for 12 years and also being a former gym leader myself no matter how short my tenure had been should’ve understood that you’re not expecting to move on from your girlfriend but you were expecting that we would’ve coerced you in there and may be say temporarily fill up the Gym Leader role via relations for 7 days which is maximum permissible days and give Misty a respite and also then it would’ve served your mutual understanding purpose given Misty won’t leave the gym even temporarily to anyone so if you came in the mishap wouldn’t have happened?”
Ash(smile) : “Brock when i returned after Unova Daisy told me to take over the role for the second half one day a few so and so came all they required was my identity of that being the latest Unova champ and before that all they needed was to refresh their memories that neither me nor my bunch was sitting idle at Unova doing nothing after Sinnoh and yeah a weekends flight then next 2 days returning again to catch a gym at Unova on the last day of week was enough to solve that trouble cause i had a Palkia who could take the whole Kanto down then and later a Kyurem who was way more incensed and no it’s not by power as that’s impossible as you know but by psychic channels making the opponents go crazy exactly what lenegds do of the order of Ghostradarkarrigussonor cause those two were infighting not using one attack but all mind games and thus the gym would’ve instantly got all protection and status cause those two had to be fed serious food to keep them in a gym totally separately from others cause that mind game if was disturbed they might’ve used thier power as well if i was physically threatened by other pokemons and yeah 59 competitons and 299 gyms wouldn’t have harmed me at all for sure and i needed to do that twice so 58 and 372 i regret not that most fervantly cause even if for trophies they still would’ve given me all that they have and i ever brushed aside all things regarding young flower dream that you know best Brock and yeah in Unova those were entering my ears too and my state wasn’t alright then barely kept from exploding cause then i would’ve been imprisoned with public massacare charges and my bunch terminated and the same would’ve happened had i reacted in that way in any of the places that i was at no matter what they did to me or what i heard all i could do was to verbally scoff them away incessantly like the whole press dreads now of me but you see i wasn’t that then and all i wanted was to be polite and get a few pokemon discussions and my attitude to female fans before Unova was known but as it became an ocean i couldn’t maintain that cause they would’ve disturbed my training then so i was being polite only exactly what Mist has done ever but for me doing that and Mist was different cause i never bothered about anyone going crazy after a star Mist was cause she can’t ever think of me like that and ever wanted to keep her Ash only focused on her regarding girls cause that was my wife Mist and the reason was i didn’t confirm my marriage and that was all and had it been Mist in my position with that accident anytime at my career since she debuted as international performer there i understand the gym trouble it was fine none would dare that cause they need their career but outside had that came about you see since Sinnoh beginning none could stop me no matter what they did with whom if i was serious and in Unova i didn’t have to be serious cause i became once in 1000 so totally immune and my Mist would’ve been beside me in that case no matter the world and even you all i wouldn’t have budged to anyone and this is exactly opposite to Mist she tried to take herself away from me cause my philosophy was that Mist told me discretely that she is all and only mine if random people had a trouble it’s not my responsibility to rectify them thus had they intruded they would’ve got the lesson but Mist’s philosophy is my Ash is only mine and he is forced to take me on his laps sitting where i will pester him or fondle him whatever and how much i want but he has put me down in the floor to get some food why is he doing so i won’t talk to him when he returns unless he pleases me as much as i want cause he’s only my Ash and that’s exactly what she was doing for 4 years that’s the 15 year old teenager that her core is with the whole world she wants wants that only nothing else and is visibly out with me cause that sweet nature of her finds her soul in me and i knowing that even if intuitively didn’t care about it as much as i should have has been my regret cause i blindfolded myself that the intuition of mine is fooling me and that 15 year if goes in vein with one picture and lack of contact the reasons of which she herself knew cause she was a customer at my starter lab,had Glalie and stardom she knew as well as the public stunts and that incident incensed me to a level where i needed to be all alone else my mad bunch would’ve caught it and would’ve gone to higher levels of lunacy taking me with them and then may be the whole world currently my Chu alone is a  Lightenthunstrom at normal most level and that lunacy has to be tackled cause they are jovial as they don’t have any fear they know they can’t better that so will die if case arises and is alright with it how strange it may sound that’s who they are but they will for only me try to better that and kill both me and them in the process unless i control so yeah all this is to say that yes unless i was present you would’nt have known about my bunch fully and you couldn’t go there to me cause you were busy but i could afford that time as i said and Mist was here she is an unique talent thus the idea that none can better her in terms of not the individual skills but the whole package gripped you cause she was how she was and the trouble started from there with presence cause i became insufficient to match that but once i myself said enough with this you saw what has happened to her and i again tell you i may die tomorrow don’t except that Misty Waterflower to be present without me cause it’s only me in a different form nothing else my antics presented in a polite manner and my silent yearning for her reflects from her as that blind all devouring devotion we need each other to remain sane and now if death atleast she or me would know the other didn’t go away from this body without fully knowing the other’s sentiment in all honesty so anyway thus,we go back to our first two questions,Brock don’t we?”
Brock(solemn) : “well whatever you may think or say Ash,just proceed with answering why you did what you did in all regards for these 4 years and no we understand the press and you don’t have to validate your alleged private life or tell us about how much you cherish your wife,just validate your actions to us and may be to Misty as well and your actions to Misty but not to Misty as to how after 4 years of absolutely no contact,suddenly you come and make things too easy to not get a suspicion over your motives no matter what Misty herself may think it to be...”
Ash(smile) : “perfect point Brock,perfect point, that if i’ve come to this realization after 4 years of full promiscuity or ardent contemplation is indeed a factor that no matter what you think Mist i must clarify to them cause they are my family and thus my duty to tell them cause they saw what you did in this regard not me so Brock,well i give you why i did what i did for 4 years cause surely i can’t blow away the allegations unless i make the press to time travel or the contemplative parts as well,so to start with my actions to my childhood friends well all I wanted to was to create a nice little beautiful comfortable hell for me with a most gorgeous and beautiful flame which was a bit too much warm for more comfort.."
Brock(sternly) : "Ash,we're talking after 4 years or so.."
Ash(frown) : "So?do i have to confess my longing for my beau..(bursts into laughter)"
Daisy(scream) : “Ketchum,you..”
Tracey(solemn,controls Daisy) : “it’s alright Ash,but i’d love it if you can be more polite and you know why.”
Ash(solemn) : “i oblidge Mr Skechit,but Mr Slate if you think because i didn’t contact you for 54 years and so i’m...”
Brock(stern) : "please,let it go,just tell me that you're not going to break Misty's
heart.."
Ash(grinning) : "Break Misty's heart?Break Misty's heart?.. that's a funny one
coming for you of all people but that’s the IDEA of yours so beloved..anyway,so i'll break my wife's heart immediately after engagement for which i can’t and won’t have any problems myself AT ALL(laugh).."
Brock(sternly) : "Ash,please,be calm and continue what you were saying"
Ash(smile) : "as you said,if you gave me a chance only"
Brock(solemn) : "Alright,restart with the hell"
Ash(smile) : "fine,and thanks for patience,really where would've i...anyhow,as i was
saying i created this beautiful hell and wished to see who jumps in and Mist
did that only she,so she's my wife now.do you want to know now how am i planning
to break her heart(laugh)?”
Brock(solemn) : "this answered only your stunt on me and your longing once more only in circle for Misty who were on the same wavelength"
Ash(laugh) : "circle i see so what bugs you is that someone else after Mr Green Jacobs (stops Misty by hugging her too firmly)..just a sec don’t leave...(to Misty)..please Mist that’s there trouble actually your actions are upto you you know that and you know me i’m not budging from saying all to them cause i love them as much as you do and this illusion will only go with this sort of language that you saw,please...”
Misty(tears,hugging Ash very firmly,shivering voice) : “i want my husband alive in this body with me unless he wants to kill me with him you know that and remember that...”
Ash(smile,patting Misty’s cheeks) : “you will have your husband all the time in this body this is too easy Mist i’ve been under all covers don’t worry...”
(back to call) sorry just Mist was a bit emotional wit that name..so after that person others could also have been in if i gave them a chance?"
Brock(solemn) : "exactly,but Misty being here still don’t mention names that’s upto you cause we know too well the names and what they did afterwards that it was a mistake from them as well from us and those chapters were closed ages ago just the idea i’m giving that I know as do you Misty did give people chances atleast and Misty herself knows this more than anyone that atleast yeah i’m being cruel to you Misty but don’t worry your husband can counter anything and i know that most so he will come out if he is honest which is my question to dicretely make him tell us now that he has the vocabulary in abundance so yeah Misty did but didn't get the right reply,but she could've as well,as could you,so this is still an open problem no matter how comfortable your hell is"
Ash(hugging Misty firmly,smile) : "well Brock,before coming here today for the last 2 months behind the whole world’s back i’ve quired the 3 concerned persons the most going at their living rooms and they frankly said including the discrete names that i mentioned that the whole affair in 4 years regarding Misty Waterflower’s actions were confusing to her the most and no about giving chances if people go to sea they will get drenched if a wave goes over them but the wave doesn’t understand what is happening to the persons cause the it wasn’t created or directed or had any intention of doing so to being with and the concerned persons if doesn’t realize that then it’s not the wave’s fault and this the discretely mentioned name expressed the most as they realized me after hunting for my heads at Unova Elite4 of all places a region whoose dragons has surrendered their myth to me wholeheartedly to propel themselves beyond imagination as Trace and Daisy knows what they now do so there they went yet was saved from being rescinded of their license and thus livelihood cause they only thought Misty Waterflower was cheated to an extent by me from which only my head would’ve appeased her they realized that the Misty Waterflower they took as real was an illusion first second they had nothing to do with her ever and not doing so was hindering their own lives and they were honest enough to express that to all of you including Misty herself may be to her their approach wasn’t right cause by then they were too greatful to me and in my last talk with them at their very own office they again confirmed that all the 3 were there due to own illusions and no reciprocration was ever there the dates were asked for by them was replied to positively in illusion by the gym leader and ever scoffed off with extreme rudeness questioning their manhoods each time before getting out of home even so you understand if Misty Waterflower gave a chance or that they were encouraged by your own illusion as to moving on is right may i continue without resentment from any of you cause i also know your own lives and who you are only too well no matter what you think and i know it was an illusion for all of us but this to remind you only that if i die tomorrow may she be left undistrubed unless she herself decides otherwise so may i continue..”
Brock(solemn) : “continue”
Ash(smile) : “most gladly,see Mist,it’s not a problem and by-the-way,oh my goodness i completely and absolutely forgot,all of you,please bare with
what i call my wife,a name Brock that’s too familier to you,i used to call her Mist in Kanto itself after my 3rd badge,and you were there so i only hope for compliance"
Brock(sternly) : "you know best you don’t need anyone’s compliance and please be serious enough to end this cause we don’t have eternity just move along"
Ash(smile) : "with pleasure,so you see for me giving people chances or not my view is that whoever came before or after Mist to me except my mom and my Pokemons were there for a reason that my soul didn't represent as it’s not made of reasons,thus Mist gets the vote of my soul"
Brock(solemn) : "so your belief is that she was destined to you?"
Ash(firmly) : "see i don’t like this idea of being destined,so i’d prefer the word SOULMATE."
Brock(solemn) : "and all else that will come can’t be that?"
Ash(solemn) : "right.i gave you my reason and the word so beloved that’s destiny IS NOT proper for that reason as well."
Brock(solemn) : "Ash,you might know i'm a practising full time Pokemon doctor
now by profession,lets play a game shall we?
Ash(smile) : "much obliged and Brock because this also is in public gospel that Ash Ketchum indeed helped to bust Team Rocket legally,you shall know that i know exactly well of your achivements since the day you parted after Sinnoh and by virtue of that absolutely who you are and so on as you’re professionally involved in Pokemon World,so congratulations for that...but lets see
what's the outcome of LOGIC,i'm excited,only Q/A right?"
Brock(solemn) : "right,can i start?"
Ash(smile) : "ever at service"
Brock(solemn) : "right, let's play,Misty comes that day,you have an accident,she follows
you for her bike,finds your tender care to Pikachu and falls for you.stay with
me on this point.ok?"
Ash(smile) : "continue"
Brock(solemn) : "1.it could've been M for her,2.it could've been F for you and 3.Misty falls
BECAUSE of your WARMTH,so there's a REASON,now logically cross these
inferences"
Ash : "gladly,2.Its no as i could’nt have even remotely cared about F which atleast I did for Mist cause atleast for the next 2 days i didn’t part company in that forest which i could if i wanted no matter what she was doing and you that well and then you were the first hand witness since day four till the unfortunate break-up that i’ve had with my then girlfriend,who happens to be my wife now,my in-your-words previous realtionship with Mist from start to that break-up existed for 13 years and you know every detail cause you were eavesdropping just as Tracey all the time to know more than me about my feelings and subsequent behaviour or the lack of those for and with Mist and you can get your 1 from here,and you know more than me that if you go further with this then that’ll prove i’m dead exactly right now so lest proceed..so the third is that,i had warmth,but i had that for Pikachu not Mist and Mist saw her own self,that’s the soul,in me,which is why i don’t like the word destined cause i did the same but again to prove my side is why this play has come into existence in the first place so anyway,yeah you got your points."
Brock(solemn) : "unsuccessful on the third,try again."
Ash(solemn) : "fine,bear with me then.agree?"
Brock(solemn) : "agree"
Ash(solemn) : "my warmth made Mist fall for me,was one moment enough for the initial 4 years
of blind devotion AND even more importantly from second day onwards and certainly you came on 4th,what did she always say of me -’my Ash’ wasn’t it? Well except her only my mom ever had that attitude to me as long as i’m concerned and you can get Mist’s beloved infatuation of 18 years according to you resolved from here and yeah you can continue."
Brock(solemn) : "well that’s only one side and not the otherwise and there were more of whom,you might’ve forgotten to check the the motives or the lack of it for that matter and among them some were there for 3,some 2 and so on,so on.."
Ash(laugh) : “sorry for laughing but couldn’t resist,(Solemn)..Brock,are you sure except for my female travel companions i never dated or kept frequent contact with any other girl long enough?”
Brock(solemn) : “well in our 12 years of companionship no you didn’t.”
Ash(smile) : "thanks,so about my travel companions who weren’t of my gender and came along with me and among them there was two whom you personally know very well cause you were there youself and then there was another about whom you know very well through multiple sources and so now from what you’ve seen and reliably heard wasn’t their attitude to me was all about- ‘my Ash is or has’,but not -‘my Ash’ ? "
Brock(solemn) : "yes."
Ash(smile) : “most humbled,so i guess you’ll walk with me if i say that barring a certain female companion of mine in Kalos,all the others in 6 years of your absence that i may’ve dated consistently also was there for a reason according to my own view about which i guess by now you’ve been cleared about if you weren’t already through the public gospel that i looked immatured and obvilivous but in reality i was the exact opposite?”
Brock(solemn) : “walking.”
Ash(smile) : “i thank you whole-heartedly,now to proceed with this certain female travel companion whoose antics through a certain note must’ve become the very first line in your gospel in the chap[ter dealing with me,also did pull some more antics in a certain call which also must be in the Playboy Ketchum chapter of you gospel has been included as the most insignificant footnote that those antics no matter how great an actress she may be and is but those are not exactly of the nature from someone whom i’ve dated for 2 years no matter why she came with me to begin with.so if i say that that certain person in my 34 years here is the single worst stoolworm in my view cause she knows most well what i did to and for her and what i got and why my consequent actions to her on being at the receiving end would you keep walking with me?”
Brock(solemn) : “ with you sentiment yes with your language of it’s description absolutely not.”
Ash(smile) : “many thanks indeed Brock.so then i’m sure you’ll agree in human world,if i broaden this and include all in my hell everyone would be not getting out of it except my mom and another person whoose position is still disputed but let me include the person as well with all else,so then if brief if i say that except my mom each person has come to me for a reason be it a moment of affection only to hand me over a glass of water due to me not being able to reach it as my sitting position in the table hindered me to,would you be alongside me?”
Brock(solemn) : “will.”
Ash(smile) : "right,perfect.so all i have to proove is that my mom has someone to accompany her and that’s my wife Mist about whom i need to proove that according to me,she has ever cherished me for no reason.isn’t that so?”
Brock(solemn) : "exactly"
Ash(smile) : “right,so Mist saying ‘my Ash’ from day 2 and my mom saying ‘my Ash’ from day 2 is different to you?
Brock(solemn) : “precisely.”
Ash(smile) : "yeah perfect the next phase of the game is going to be a bit too cold for a bit too uncomfort and thus i’ll have to ask Mist if she can bear..."
Misty(firmly,hugging Ash very firmly) : "Misty Ketchum will bear with anything that her husband says with only a very small complain that no matter what her husband did today,he
deserved atleast his first night alone with her,alright lets continue."
Ash(smile,hugging Misty very firmly) : "right Mist,stay along.so to start Brock,about the number of chances given to get out of the hell will be absolutely zero because that’s the whole point of the hell it isn’t it?”
Brock(solemn) : “yes.”
Ash(smile) : “great.so you see Brock,the logic is that those wanting the chances you will find does so because their central reason to be personal with me has been broken and thus they’re no more comfortable to get out and come back to me all by themselves thus you fail my very first filter then if you've managed to come back once but not twice,twice but not thrice,infinitely many times but not the very next time and so on,then you fail my second filter,but even if you did,i'll cheat on you,be with someone else or have a family with someone else,be loyal to them,and as many combinations you can create you may create and i'll do all that individually to you infinitely many times and not stop still but if you STILL want me ONLY no matter the iteration number,then you've surpassed my first step that ok you're elligible atleast.then i'll kill you by poisoning you and reveal to you that yes i'm your murderer and before death you'll ONLY want me,ONLY your murderer will be wanted by you,then you pass the 2nd door IF you can repeat what has been told just before,now while you're dying knowing that i killed you and i’m laughing in front you watching your slow death telling you that i’m your murderer indeed,then if you gleefully want to be killed by me again and again and again and again and STILL say you'll not but want me ONLY again and again and be RATHER killed again and again by me than be with me for just one moment if the former assured ultimate unison though uncertain in temporal scale,then it's the third,now you'll bear all pain for me while i'm in hell but you're in heaven,if i'm starving on a secluded jungle,you're with the best of foods with your spouse and childern happily loyally married yet feeling my starving only and is actually DYING with me and you'd ONLY want to die with me and ONLY wish to be able to be with me and starve TOGETHER,and repeat that again and again,then it's the fourth door..and conversely for 5 th you’ll be the greatest destitute me the greatest king,yet you’ll be king too in your mind happily only thinking of me...no matter what i’m what i do you won’t leave me you wont stop your pursuit for me,you’ll never have me ever but this very absolute impossibilty to have me through all eternity will only make you totally lunatic in my pursuit,you’re whole being will only know one thing that it doesn’t matter what,i’ll not desist to have you though i know i wont ever have..this assured failure will not defeat you,you’ll be invincibility epitomised in my pursuit in my want in your longing for me in your yearning for me,in your heart-wrenching death for me-(grave)YOU WILL BECOME-IMMORTAL...(straight)that immortality though is only the 6th hell(bursts into laughter)..um..sorry,just came off..anyway(laugh),this only opens up the door to 7th,which is alright i’ll take you up,alright i’ll be with you and so on faithfully that is etc but i won’t have a family with you,i will force you to my whims and that is you will not have anything called future and so on cause why bother about it if that is why you’re with me than basically you fail the very first door isn’t it that you’re here for the body and so on cause that is random sampling again and that’s just like herd again a particular couple like Gengar has only one partner throughtout life but still it could be anyone hence you turn out to be biggest vulgar being existing(laugh) cause to you the future and so on is again blood and sweat and so on only hence a matter of yourself not about the future that is you want a robot or a plaything totally dependent upon you rather than being connected to that as your own extension and so on but most importantly you think it’s just the body which isn’t the case is it? i could’ve been born anywhere could’ve been could’ve been could’ve been hallucinations(laugh),anyway,sorry for this as well but it will get way worse than even this with 8th and so on coming so now,all couples present here it'll get more and more uncomfortable from here so if you want please leave,except Brock and Mist,you know your position."
Tracey,Daisy(unison,shivering voice) : "we'll go to the end"
Ash(smile) : "much appreciated,be prepared till the second warning"
(All except Misty in unison,shivering voice) : "continue"
Misty(tears,shivering) : "Brock,you..you still want more(scream,crying) MY PRIVATE
LIFE,Dase..you..(crying loudly)it's MY PRIVATE LIFE with MY HUSBAND..this is
my first...you're my..(chokes)"
Ash(whispering in Misty's ears) : "Mist they are married too this is their life as well i’m universalizing ours only to include them,and no it's ok sweetie(hugging Misty)just leave it upon me dear."
Misty(crying) : "i'm going and if you were..(cuts off)"
Ash(smile) : “so now if only Brock stays that’ll be enough.”
Brock(sternly,shivering) : "I will walk with Ash as i’ve ever had for 12 years no matter where he goes,rest of you can go if you want"
Daisy(tears): "Ash,you think that we're.."
Ash(smile) : "no i don’t think what you’re thinking Daisy ,i know what you and Trace are going through, and i also know why Brock wants to travel with me no matter what and i perfectly know why you've been listening to matters my private life,correct me if i'm wrong Daisy,ALL.OF.YOU.ARE.LISTENING.SO.INTENTLY.CAUSE.THIS.IS.EXACTLY.WHAT.YOU.DO.see this is UNIVERSAL life for any couple soulmates that is, and i’m telling you cause i know how much it applies for all of you and why none of you are in general marriages like a random couple so and so i know your bonds with your soulmates and all things around that for 19 long years and thus is this.so this is YOUR very private life as well and these are YOUR very personal deeds as well and that's why you've been paying so close an attention and don't want to leave,so let me cut to the very end,even if you do all this i may not at all select you,why? AS IT'S MY CHOICE,the invincibility is to you but it has no value to me.why should it be? Totally illogical as I’m not doing the same for you,I’m not bothered about you,I JUST DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU(laugh)..and that’s what it is,it’s not MY side and it’s not MY problem or RESPONSIBILITY for YOUR feelings for me.Totally lunatic idea if you think so and this is exactly why Brock i don’t like the word DESTINY as if it was just a throwaway that you could’ve been found with anyone like i was being found according to public gospel BUT DESTINY is all that you get just a specific random one as DESTINY would have it,as if it’s all about like pokemons ah get anyone it’s just a matter of you know what nothing a big deal but this is excatly why we’re not pokemons and exactly why it’s a big deal for us unlike pokemons so now in gross terms to choose someone what will i do is that i’m going observe perfectly,persistently,precisely and with being perceptive that exactly who IS NOT destined out of random samples cause then that can definitely be called soulmate and soulmate is that if and only if i see (agitated)EXACTLY,ABSOLUTELY,PRECISELY,SOLELY MY OWN SELF,MY OWN BEING,MY OWN SOUL that is (very agitated) I and that is NOT MY and if I see THIS I in MY OTHER HALF,then only(suddenly flustered)..um..i’m sorry..um..it..um..terribly sorry..um..what have i..(Misty hugs Ash firmly crying)"
Daisy(sobbing,a few moments later): "i'm leaving as well,i only wish Lil was here..i'll tell her
later..Ash,um..would you mind if i still call you Ketchum?"
Ash(laugh) : "that would actually be right Daisy,just call me anything.."
Daisy(tears,smile) : "enough Ash,i'll only sometimes call you Ketchum(smile),you made my
day and my 19 years,i saw you first 19 years back for your second ever badge,you had just about started may be your 14th or 15th day,then you were with Mist and i knew for sure what was going inside her and what has continued for 19 long years no matter what but my only ever problem was that i never believed in you or your skills cause i never found a reason or hint to do so no matter what and that was the same even today but then..(tears)..i'm seeing you now Ash..it's
almost moring now,just the wish that may such sun everyday..(choke)"
Ash(smile) : "Daisy,i get you,we're more than family and has been for exactly those many years you mentioned and exactly why i could so nonchalantly swear Brock,Trace,you,Lillie,Gary and even Professor of all people and kept no contacts for 4 years knowning well it’ll take one moment to erase the 5000 years and this family is NOT DESTINY..(smile)..i’ve ever had 3 big sisters as well very own and so sorry if i’ve ever hurt them but it’s just your little bro’s madness consider that..anyway,so no need for these,please take rest,don't strain yourself,please...the FUTURE is only bright..please take rest..”
Daisy(smile,tears of joy,shivering voice) : "um..thanks Ash..tell Mist that..(tears,chokes)..and those at Unova..(profuse tears of joy)..anyway...bye"
Tracey(sternly,shivering,tears) : "Brock you started it you go till the end,i'll not hear a thing
more,and Ash,um..anyhow,just come today sometime and forget that Unova totally,ok..bye.."
Ash(laugh) : "sweet sweet Trace..and Brock did you get what i just s.."
Brock(smile) : "Ash,enough.i’ve travelled the world with you for 11/12 long years..I knew you to be mischievous but only with Misty all time(Ash laughs) and sometimes with Me that too you'd do only as she all the time(both laughs) or i most rarely(both laugh) if pushed you too much in those feelings(both laugh),you just brushed aside 4 years like a twig from your path,i'm too busy now a days with your vulture business(both laugh),but you two are welcome anytime and come together only,what else to say.."
Ash(smile) : “before first you have only one month left to vulture business so DON’T STILL BE NAIVE(both laugh),now first(both laugh) you must absolutely have eternity no not finish this call(both laugh) and i’ll swear off any vulture anywhere cause of my REACH(both laugh) and finances surely you know the gatefees(both laugh) and all cause i’m fully Mistyvious(both laugh,Misty hugs Ash firmly smiling with tears,Ash tenders her) and second that you’re as usual just so naive(both laugh) and don’t be naive in thinking that because i’ve got now 107 barring Mime Chu of all will suddenly turn on you or Trace or your soulmates of all people just if so tell him and you know too well Crawdauntogator(both laugh) but note that Gary isn’t included cause Tyranitar doesn’t obey(both laugh) Yveltal and Madgaleo as well(both laugh) just that what they show the world is because they can independently do their jobs and thus they scoff at me saying you’re the idiotic clueless master brat(both burst into laughter) first this is the sweet cute idiot(both laugh,Misty in tears of joy smiles at Ash hugging him very firmly and Ash tenders her) as exactly said as soon as i said that if you have a beau as you’re saying then why are you here without the police(both laugh) and that was it(both laugh) before that called my mom to know my whereabouts calling her mom(both laugh) same bug as ever no matter the gym leading cosmetics(both laugh,Ash pats Misty’s cheeks,Misty smiles hugging Ash very firmly) so was ever and if ever any doubts that i had realized that to show whom what the brats were used in which way like in Orange(both laugh) though that certain who was nowhere around(both laugh) so no matter and besides the few men that were there in HQ are my fans now cause i politely send them back to home from a place which they never gave a thought of travelling before and then there i won 300 hall of fame gym badges with 72 competitions having brought 15 dragons and 4 ghosts such as Hoopa,Confragigus,Chaneldure and Aegislash(both laugh) and yeah those men said in 10 scale of time permitted you were the discussion of topic from Viridian to confession to how sweet you and Glalie were for 9(both laugh)..later when still my Ash wasn’t calling my Ash from my own phone(both laugh) was made 7 out of 10 rest two just your distance calculation with the current respect(both laugh,pats Misty’s cheeks again laughing,Misty same pose smiles at Ash)..just a moment of madness totally cured as 3 time champs would be as you know the reason for being the 3 time champ i’ve been later made aware of the school days(both laugh) and Salamences(both laugh) and the confidence levels were there cause Cobalions defeated Solgaleos to break dreams of 5 times champs in 8th regions(both burst into laughter) had a prolonged chat with the men in their offices at Lumburg Orange HQ too fond of me now wants to make themselves alongside newly realized soulmates like me that is the philosophy of being a Gengar(both burst into laughter) Gengarian philosophy has caught them and i fuelled it to absolute maxima(both laugh) really some brats those are(all laugh) finally told all family drama we were sent to check on you as pawns cause Daisy flower and Lillie flower and of course Viol flower likes to keep certain men hanging(both laugh) thus wasn’t happy that being their protegree how can the baby flower become a Gyarados and devour me at the first sight itself totally bilndly(both laugh,Misty smiles at Ash hugging him firmly,Ash keeps tendering her)..thus they were just pawns and so happy to be have resigned from the drama company(both burst into laughter)..really those brats made my day that day trying to be Gengar and all cause soulmates aren’t listening to too frank Gengars(both laughter)..what brats they are(both laugh)..and our Gyaradosy young Misty flower doesn’t know one thing except my Ash so all the rest were just that why is my Ash not fondling me still as much as he should(both laugh,Ash smiles at Misty,Misty smiles at Ash hugging him very firmly) young flower my dream um..no no daydream(both laugh,Misty hides her face in Ash’s chest smiling hugging him very firmly,Ash keeps tendering her) same sweet Gyaradosey Mist bug nothing changes and you see Brock all my stuffs were to prove to myself that i can stay single and the life of a pokemon named Gengar(both laugh) which beautiful men at Orange HQ is obsessed with as life philosophy(both burst into laughter) may the infinite compassion help them(both laugh) so i wanted to be like my Gengar- totally carefree as to any sort of personal relationship cause i don’t care about anyone and the things i told you are my views on opposite gender if they pester me(both laugh) Unovan Madgaleo directed by great Tyranitar(both laugh) and supported by the drak marchant Yveltal(both laugh) as you know a bit from me then was all about me letting them think independently started by Feraligator supported by Chu that i need to be taught a lesson that the sweet cute idiot needs to be commanded(both laugh) absolutely same view no difference and that’s why i had to delete the whole world off from my head to appease the brats with new dragons who are utmost brats themselves(both laugh) you sure know what my bunch does and talks a bit and sure Noivern who was thrown out as leader of group cause breeding season skirmishes are AH!don’t disturb just that blooming youth(both burst into laughter)..so you can understand they are like humans with limitations thus totally free of myself just that bond so deepened made tham this along with who they are in-bron like Muk and Snorlax(both laugh) and the rest i guess you know surely some bits about my bunch in terms of how powerful they are like Chu,Luxray and Zekrom are 3 max normal mad Lightenthunstrom and the intelligence level is nowhere near that name as you know(both laugh) and still Zekrom is Lightenthunstrom normal mad max+4(both laugh) and our Lillie flower and Daisy flower increased their fondling rate directed at my bunch as the anger increased(both laugh) just the family as well man,all of you and i know too much of my Mantine-sis(both laugh) i was obsessed with that beautiful hell to make it most comfortable for me to share with my flower who thought the trouble arouse all cause the ponytail wasn’t there on the break-up day(both laugh)..it’s just an illusion Brock nothing else we’re no normal family and you don’t need anything to understand what my feelings and and why they are so cause it’s that FEELING(both laugh) but Brock i’m proud of myself that that day i roasted a truest damn brat despite you(both laugh) in fact it was at them sorry for the mix up(both laugh) but surely that private thing didn’t go out cause of that exact language(both laugh) and your passage was safe cause that brat realized if 12 year close friends can do that imagine what the man did to him(both laugh) and don’t dare to call me your friend or bro cause i’m the comrade(both laugh) Dawn was 16 when she namecalled you being 31(both laugh) just so naive(both laugh) and whole accident was accident and the wisdom merchants got it horribly wrong as you see cause they expected bribes as usual to fight truely like Steelix does now(both laugh) and the letter just the whole watered rock family love them(both laugh) and Brock to be honest even if that was true Violet is what she is and the rest you know best so it’s just that i’m overjoyed for both of you as you are both always SENSEI(both laugh) so i won’t ask for forgivance cause you’re with your soulmate first second you’re quote full time practising professional pokemon poacher(both laugh) and i eavesdropped you to know your career and what you are at which position by means of REACH(both laugh) a returned favour(both laugh) and i ever knew you’re a great person when it comes to the point that with them you must be naive(both laugh)..no way you’re family to me man no way(both laugh)..Unovan namecalled incident created a confusion in me that if a brat is infatuated enough to first humiliate herself in public that she’ll regret as she becomes a wife if she is honest which is the doubt(both laugh) then why is my flower so much infatuated with me to the point that young flower dream is ever brushed aside no matter the implications that i had to hear for ages and now that because a picture comes and i don’t contact means 14 years gone to bay then i must immediately propose her(both laugh) turned down cause how can my Ash say that my Mist isn’t the only one that can mind the words BOOK him as a COACH(both laugh,pats Misty’s head,Misty same pose smiles at Ash) herself was too strained and i was naive(both laugh) then 4 years and undercover then a sudden realiztion was enough and i feel so horrible that my flower had to endure so much pain so yeah infatuated so much as ever as to forget that i am a boy and she is a girl thus the ever proximity that the literal is never enough to give(both laugh) and thus i was told to give a ring and go back to the so and so if i didn’t say that she’s my Mist(both laugh) the ring is my Ash why he wasn’t there after Sinnoh even if a false ring(both laugh) cause my Ash only i now can book all i want cause he’s only my Ash you namecalls(both laugh) during the date not one word as to my motives or her activities you namecall you’re never a playboy cause you’re only Misty’s boy(both laugh) only mine you are you stupid idiot you’re only my Ash(both laugh) and you’re doomed to this inevitibity in every life(both laugh) even after proposal i said you thought i’ve a new girlfiend i can’t have SHUT UP!why are you talking about girls(both laugh) just that same 16 year old bugged-flower that wanted me to walk behind her(both laugh) and now i should be carrying her on my arms no matter the cosmetics(both laugh)..a hall of fame gym leader with worldwide name and all all illusion the reality is this sweet cute my Ash i’m Gyaradosey-Mist(both laugh)..and you know exactly why these personal romance tales of ours are so sweetly universal being of long long time too happily married couple sweetness(both laugh,Ash laughs at Misty who smiles at him same pose) marriage at first sight you know(both laugh) and as for me i know the discourse was enough for our DaisyDevil of all flowers(both laugh) but still if it was ONLY CAUSE i’m experienced(both laugh) still just to end that i can’t see a girl as notMist(both laugh) you know that most(both laugh) so notMist became onlyFlesh(both laugh) and besides you’ll surely know that i have total 67 psychics including Sharpedo and 19 ghosts mind the tense of your knowledge(both laugh) and i roam around with Ultranercozma and/or Giratina(both laugh) or Gengar and Sableye(both laugh) and Dusknoir,Darkrai,Malamar as new imports(both laugh) or Rayquaza and Mismagius or Rotom and so on so on so on of course(both laugh) sorry to disturb your Viol flower then and then and now(both laugh) but then you should’ve asked me the right calling schedule at fiirst then(both laugh) at second she should’ve been gaged only(both laugh) and at third now Chu says starve only to maximize what’s the most ENJOYING(both burst into laughter) yeah that brat of course as well(all lugh) but the songs meant if you can be a naively crooked philosopher I TOO AM AN EARNING AND WORKING PROFESSIONALLY INDEPENDET WOMAN MANTINE(both burst into laughter) nothing more ever knew all of us she is just too sweet too liitle too much Mantinelet(both laugh) and you know that she knows only about Mantine but more than any Mantine himself knows(both laugh) and i had extracted that knowledge ages ago in Sinnoh no matter the namecalls in betwwen the swings of greatest caring husband and biggest infatuated brat(both laugh) i’m only happy for all of you and happy for myself that i’ve had a family since day one 19 years back that’s all that’s not a family cause i am compared to Gengar(both laugh)..bye,but enough with trash talks can i get your dishes again(both laugh).."
Brock(laugh) : "ONLY IF you came together with your sweetenedly-ponytailed-finally-official-19 year long marrierd-wife-friend-best-bugged-Gyarados(both bursts into laughter,Misty smiles and blushes a little hugging Ash firmly) but come prepared to be swallowed up by Violovious(both bursts into laughter)..but just a thing Ash,Unovan legends bit too greedy for even tonight aren’t they?...”

Drew(smile) : “all are absolutely brilliant by all means you being here serves the cherry on top as much does the future double dilight for us making it triple as you’re Misty too and viseversa(smiles,Ash laugh)..”
Ash(smile) : “just came off that stuff Kalos had 3 University lectures on soul(both laugh) abstruse philosophical topics you must know my bunch’s antics long story in one words no wish to battle either me or my bunch and they can work independently using their brains bossing me around somehow that love for me so deepend now has become my siblings and thus their own natural nature of not knowing what a battle is is reflecting but they have much control over that being with me thus the antics wants to make friends with the whole world like Team Rocket’s greatest boss(laughs,Drew smile)...started at Kalos as you know but i wasn’t clear myself as to what they were doing just realized too playful now after all those mental battles at Unova and that was at it’s beginning in Kalos that now too tried and too much knowledge about themselves doesn’t fear and independent they were at Sinnoh final so now will roam around with me but as my siblings and thus i was somewhere else in my mind never knew where i was all the communications and advises you so many times told me to keep grounded ever helped those but for just that day to next was floating around in mind you know what all these means in nerveous channels that suddenly your bunch is doing all these and thus then had to have all possible foods to keep myself sane and grounded and them as well ate any philosophical food for deep thinking to sharpen myself up to understand more about everything thus the confusions went too finally realized not full without Mist returned and the press antics may be you’ve heard all the pain that public stunts had to happen on me and my break-up and all thought of chewing up each everwhere and all thus these..”
Drew(smile) : “yeah i understand man,confusion was the reason not ego if your bunch is doing that they will get that down themselves(both smile) and no then we only realized your bunch a bit but it was just that ever thought you were too much in ego because of that but that sentiment you will realize first hand if ego ever came so yeah all looking so bright and your sis is giggling too much with the perfect never but close proposal by biased costs(both laugh) here’s she..”
May(smile) : “bro..why weren’t you the best man for both of us(Drew and Ash laughs)..”
Ash(laugh) : “why not marry your rose again today(all smile)...and no dear i was devillish to you that day last year in short you know that female travel companion of mine as i told you then last day just vefore parting the emotions of infatuation took over her and being Kalos from Kalos public seaport in front of other two travel companions suddenly runs up and gets physical then didn’t say anything later phoned her got the treatment and that treatment continued for 4 more times at each comeback attempt even if her family was there finally made an agreement 4th time that she was all wrong and that was it and then your anniversary had to be the very next day after that incident and if Unova was a random stranger this is from someone who saw me day and night for 27 months and my behaviour to her and all the rest no matter the public opinion still does that ever took as a little sis got turned out to be so and so and by then i was hardly alright in my head you sure know what my bunch does told Drew just now independent from me as my siblings no more master pokemon stuff nervous pressure all the time and then the break-up was 4 years old by then all combined for 4 years of my severity on personal relations and then this incident was the fire to hey you called and said ‘bro’ that moment i forgot my sweet little sis May so dear to me ever and very own and replaced her with that so and so and that moment has been my worse cause i forgot you were not my own sweet little sis for once in 12 years and thus could say all those then afterwards ever had a regret but all things combined never wanted to go back to old roots and mostly no personal relations my bunch ever was there with me my illusion that my very dear ones were only there for my smiles and warmth and skills and not my heart and soul gripped me and only rest was with the bunch who only realized the second part thus with them i thought that was it and thus the antics at press to destroy any that came for a coffee and was going on till realized Mist was my wife forever and the things as Brock told you must’ve heard was exactly those in intuition got back here removed the depression first by masking a fake fight to get her out of that mess at Cerulian and then today just a very long date started with a skirmish then you know her ever my Ash herself jumped on me only waiting for me for 4 years as i realized just the date and the words to confirm and thus proposed her and all officialities will come as soon and visit to Daristrum as well to celebrate my coming nephew and or nice singular or plural in number triple delight for me(all smile)...”
May(smile) : “yeah for me too the other one soon as well we know too well(smile,Ash laughs,Misty hugging Ash smiles at him,Drew smiles as well)..”
Ash(smile) : “thanks for future-telling(laughs,all else smiles)..your prize is a coming in the end cause you know the motto of battle starvation longer the wait stronger the feeling of joy(laugh,all else smile,Drew laughs) before that how my little bro little and uncle and aunt and how’s little bro’s no so little girlfriend(both laugh)...”
May(smile) : “little bro little big is in moon with Mia the girlfriend big(all laugh) A license atmost within one year 3 months then will be waiting together for the littler littles(both and Drew laugh,Misty smiles) and mom,dad fine more fine cause the committee would've had to look after atmost 15 years(both and Drew laugh,Misty smiles) but mind the tense(both and Drew laugh,Misty smiles at Ash) and don’t bother all of us ever thought just that spoiled brat away from family too big in head thinks living seperate is such a daring thing(both and Drew laugh,Misty smiles looking at Ash) all are fine more than that but why the rush to the end hum(all three laugh,Misty hugs Ash firmly smiling)”
Ash(laugh) : “cause with all these family reunion going so emotional your rose will be busy cause you with lack of words would just vomit aside(all three burst into laughter,Misty laughs shaking her head) countering yeah(all laugh)..”
May(laugh) : “too clever i see cunningly(all laugh)...so how’s the honey in moon set(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “May am i not your big responsible gym leader sis(all laugh)..”
May(laugh) : “um..sorry Ms(all laugh)..that is the mask no more in all cases(all laugh) but surely countering has reached the romantic long sermon part(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “too longing so cooked the climax for 6.5 hours(all laugh) finally the 3 words(all laugh)..but you should be as well then RESTING(all laugh)..”
May(laugh) : “mutual(all laugh)..enjoy the dawn(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “right knowledgebale advise(all laugh) so here’s the prize as i say my bunch do the antics they do and i’ve listening to them for 7 years now in which if humanized will mean something extremely funny and yet meaningful at places and first and most importantly my bunch i’m sure everyone in contests know atleast Noivern(all laugh,May and Drew both reciprocates saying - ‘sadly’ all laugh even more) but Gengar i guess..(all laugh,May and Drew both reciprocate as ‘ticklly’ all laugh even more) right(all laugh) and i’ll give 7 prizes for my dear sis and my dear bro-in-law and bro also Drew just make the time(all laugh)..this one first from Noivern professor of pokemon epistemology(all laugh) a challenger comes..
i see you want to attack but this thought of this attack that is appearing to you as a thought in your thoughts as a thought according to your previous thoughts as you see and deal with the thoughts of the issues that you face at your age(all burst into laughter) see i was the chosen leader of my group but i was outsed cause you see master brat(all burst into laughter) yeah that’s my name now(all laugh) i was approached to solve a dispute that my group and other groups had during breeding season skirmishes but i told them that don’t disturb them it’s just that blooming youth(all burst into laughter)...102 out of 107 can’t breed now as you know but this to tell you professor Noivern is of course not among the 5 cause of that age(all laugh)..
next from Sinnoh comes the great Samurott his type is water-ground-dark..challenger comes..
dark must be bright/water must be not swam but alight/ground sure is to be swam as opposing me you agree might/that what’s at the left to me isn’t that at your right(all burst into laughter)...infallibale logic(all laugh)...
next is the only and only merchant at nowhere of somewhere sorry nowhere Reshiram(all laugh)..challenger comes..
before comeing here i was there from where i came here but now only from being here i can know from where i came but agin similarly now where i am i can only know if i go back to my previous place thus where am i actually(all burst into laughter)..merchant at somewhere sorry nowhere(all laugh)..
next come as a duo Butterfree and Palkia where Butterfree shows the challenger that he is the challenger and viseversa(all laugh) and Palkia circularly shows that you can’t know either yourself or the other(all laugh) this is joint..
i can’t know me and you can’t know you cause i only see me as not being as you and you can’t tell me who i really am cause you only tell me your ideas of who i am but you can see me and i can see you as diferent to me and you know i’m different to you but as you see me as different to you only then you know that you’re different from me thus ain’t it so that the difference that you are never what’s me only then can you know that you’re not me thus if you know me only as different to you then isn’t it so that you already know you(all burst into laughter,clap)..no more words circularly metaphysical(all laugh)..
now i will do this 6th first then keep the last 7th for the last cause that’s special so this is one from Hawlucha(all laugh) Orange where i was the champ thus lost in Mist as 3rd day called mom my Ash um..(all laugh,Misty smiles hugging Ash firmly Ash tenders her head)... mind the words and Hawlucha’s type as i say, standing on the air without the help of wings(all laugh)/but fighting on the ground though without the limbs(all burst into laughter,clap)/thinking of some thoughts without trying to think(all laugh,clap)/ideas and words May and Drew since 16 why are you trying to link(all burst into laughter,clap)...how’s the almost complete prize sister-pester(all laugh)..”
May(laugh) : “especially the last was going on in university lecture halls for sure hours after hours AGAIN AND AGAIN EACH TIME(all burst into laughter)..don’t blame poor birds and the word(all laugh)...really made all the years bro and at this form surely Mr Ash Ketchum is double Hall of Fame in romance and comedy mastery(all laugh)...but tonight be specific while lost in Mist(all laugh)...night all and good morning there to the sun mind that(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “i see Torchic has become Flygon(all laugh) and the sun after ever after the moon(all laugh) on the rise(all laugh)..advanced ‘night to my sweet little sis with a hug and to her rose with a pat for being after all not infatuated with vomits ONLY till(all burst into laughter)...”
Drew(laugh) : “i see still testing(all laugh)..cause need the counter that you’ve been tested today itself and will be again(all laugh)..best of luck considering my position in career of cleaning in futre tense(all laugh)...night in advance tickling for the surprize(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “i see shrewed(all laugh)...but what’s that disease(all laugh)..anyway,before final prize sis and you too Drew,check up a Mr David Duncun,Pokemon Master Hall of Fame,6 leagues,6-1,met me at Unova Round1 as well,Celestic Sinnoh,double hall of fame being undercover at team rocket as main battler alongside me and check up his infoes at sometimes within may be 10 hours or 1(all laugh) and May this is the name of my little bro your 2nd eldest bro now,found as you and me found our siblings same way,during undercover the closure then by Kalos Elite4 realized the final,faced Mist while was at Kanto,which was his last region,Cerulian penaltimate badge,Pewter last,is here with me,wants to settle here my reach and rich will get the lab to max possible 6150 arcs here including the whole Viridian Forest as conserved area yeah,need that spot to be private property(Ash and Drew laugh,others smile) and 3 cities cup competition will get revamped all Dave’s category and he is just Brock with a huge laugh,battle maddened too zealous too sweet too simple just May’s reddened verison and May your 2nd eldest sis-in-law,Zara,is a lawyer,out of profession,met during undercover,was with team rocket as lawyer didn’t know under whom she was working for 4 months before we entered and then the eventual,huge story all in good times,Dave is too simple and like Brock too naive himself will minutely tell you every second as if knows you for eternity like siblings as we are(smile,all else smile) and Zara is exactly like you my dear sis too sweet and she is my sis as well like Drew is my bro but unlike her of course i did cross too many limits with Drew more than once too(laughs,May and Misty smiles and Drew laughs as well)..anyway well,Dave’s parents and Uncle and aunt all are in farm business but his parents went inside his mind when he was 15 and the reason was they were caught in an accident at a farm and the reason was team rocket they were most unfortunate,the financial support was there ever for Dave and he is just too interested a battle nut doesn’t understand anything else too simple and his uncle and aunt supported and his cousin big bro and his other half Lucian and Tayla as well all are out of profession Lucian is at a service huge service financial stuff,chartered accountant at some import-export company and Tayla own businesses all too sweet..neither Dave nor Zara wants to leave my side and infact Brock we will need at 6150 and in any case the whole colony it will be and hence that naive crook must absolutely be here to complete it with Violet(all smile),Dave knows about each and ever one of you pretty well just haven’t met and his case is that in Kalos Elite4 you surely know about the differentiation then i actually didn’t find any happiness being at human level cause with most subtle levels with my bunch i was at my real home more and wanted to live the life of a Gengar as you know my name was told and Dave realized it confronted me saying you still have me and Zara halt that was the cherry on the 4 year cake got my bro and larger family and my Mist finally why i couldn’t become a Gengar(all smile),so this is a brotherly present for both of you and little bro little pest..”
May(smile,bit shivering voice of joy,hugging Drew,Drew smiles at her and tenders her) : “bro..just wait till i physically eat you up(all laugh)..and Max will beak him off as usual(all laugh)..really,can’t wait to meet my 2nd bro and pester him(all laugh) and lawyers are so naive(all laugh)...really bro it’s just all the 1 year for me came back by all 13 of joy(all smile)..”
Drew(smile) : “no,man with your personality and those questions i faced first hand(Ash laughs shaking his head,others smile),surely neither can you stop extending your family nor live without them;ever had your bro with you still while not with us(all smile)..really man,Gengar we realize now in full ticklly(both laugh others smile)..i’m just speechless in joy just best wishes and yeah questions too,a real bash awaits(all smile)..”
Ash(smile) :”yeah,at earliest and tomorrow will be vieo calls for hours get prepared for surprizes well may be 7/8 hours only but hence sleep well(laugh and Drew also laughs,other’s smile) and yeah Drew,Tony boy with his psycho will be dealt by me tomorrow Oliv gently and Tony boy not so at all(both laugh,others smile) they by now have been told and are in cloud 90 already literally from 9(both laugh,others smile) and now,this final is the prize now completes only today 99 still left and then circulate(all smile) to be happy(all smile) as i said always my bunch this all was just cause of them have delivered only a better version of me Tyranitar all the way(laugh others smile) so this,
comes from the one and only Yveltal(all laugh)..surely all of you know that brat(all laugh)...challenger comes..
i see you want to challenge cause you want to be happy/and all it’s so cause you’re unhappy(all burst into laughter,clap)/cause within your self you’re not happy/thus you can’t see others as being happy(all laugh clap)/thus if you really want to be happy/then you must know first what makes you unhappy(all burst into laughter,clap)/thus you see this idea of being happy and unhappy/ever is opposite to the other thus shouldn’t you be happy(all burst into laughter,clap)..in pursuit of happiness(all laugh and clap),night(all burst into laughter and reciprocate and bye)...”

(few moments later)
Misty(laugh) : “surely Ash if these brats are there you got to be happy(both laugh)...and i’m so happy to be my Ash(smiles at Ash and hugs Ash very firmly)..”
Ash(smiles at Misty and hugging Misty very firmly) : “right cause you’re not unhappy being not not so(both laugh)..saw that Mist none came for any reason you just most dear they around that as important as you are ever with me but that brat Yveltal too sadly(both laugh)...now back to bro he told me about the match and all knew about you cause in last days of undercover that’s the custom if any of the colleagues get out tells the dear ones the fate and atleast tells the authority their condition cause they may neglect them or if thhey have any special messages and so on and then you know always under the gillotine anyway you’re very close and then we come out he is a battle buff(laugh,Misty smiles) no emotion no personal life nothing parents weren’t in profession but big fans he was 14 when they passed on in an accident at his hometwon for some of their deals where they were entagled in the farm and thus was the misfortune he went to his uncle Mr Eden and has a cousin bro 2 years older to him Lucian out of profession excellent man just like his dad and mom and his mom Dave’s aunt is Mrs Jessica and also Lucian’s other half Tayla as well excellent person they all are very very nice people very cheerful nice persons and his parents were financially very well positioned as are his uncles and cousin as well and Lucian is in a company very good post import export business huge company infact and he is in finace departments a chartered accountant too good a post then Tayla as well does some small business independent and Mr Eden is in farming business as was Dave’s parents Mr Reynold and Mrs Molly and Dave thus was ever financially very secured and had the backing so that was ok he will himself tell his family history and my undercover days to you too enthusiastically cause to him and later while i was vulturing around Cerulian to book my flower i was chiding him and Simon who was in my gang as to i want my Mist immediately(laugh,Misty smiles at Ash tendering his hairs) so he knows you extremely well and will be so too happy to meet you by any medium(laugh,Misty smiles) Dave is just a man like Brawn you know everhappy carefree soul and i’m so ashamed that i dragged even a man like Brawn(laugh hugs Misty very firmly,Misty tenders Ash’s hairs and strokes his cheeks tenderly and smiles at him) anyway Dave is of same nature as i said a battle nerd outside world is forgotten and faced me at Unova first round Feraligator defeated Palkia with one ice beam(laugh) next round Crawdaunt against Tapu Koko same result a dark beam and Crawdaunt zapped back to me ate up my cap had a reserve put it on(both laugh) then upset thought illegal later in undercover James of all people was my confident he wanted me there and i would’ve been there you know Mist cause my bunch would’ve smoked off any legends then not all but most could and i had no fear from that and generally you’re only in a life threat if you get too deep which other profeesionals should do after you get the pokemons sorted out but we did all me and Dave ever went forward protecting all cause the situation was that there were pokemons as guards not humans and so on so we needed to work side by side to get them totally busted and thus it went on and Dave found Zara there his wife now for 4 years immediately married after getting out.Zara is a lawyer general lawyer just a Pidgey keeps at santuary with others(laugh,Misty smiles at Ash) from Sandgem Town,Sinnoh as well but it’s 4900 km apart from Celestic(laugh) but at the soul nothing so only pure happiness and unison(both smile at each other same pose) and she was working for Team Rocket and then our group got her within 2 months and infact her side change turned the tides for us along with Jesse of all people(laugh) and both turned for their husbands(laugh,Misty smiles at Ash and tenders his hairs) well Jesse did Zara only came to know she was hired for wrong reasons and only was employed for 4 months anyway and you know Dave faced the same atrocity as me as did the other 4 people in our group and he is exactly like a child i have ever been most cunning fox just ask spew for that(laugh,Misty smiles at Ash tendering his hairs) it was horrendus on him and battle you know it was nothing my brats as you know Unova and then this jovial nature was settling in and Crawdauntogator showed that in the final and these brats now are like topmost category legend in power similar as best trained best normal max power but their intelligence is way way heigher as you see and it’s just that that was ok i ever felt an attraction to Dave since i met him just before undercover he ate the bait cause of that accident that sent his parents away into abstraction when he was 15 had a huge reason to jump and did so he is a famous name you know 7,6 would’ve been had he not faced me at Unova best battler from Sinnoh for sure in number two in the world i guess just below Lance only phenomenal battler and against Lance had 5-5 then extra set lost 2-1 and you know how hard that is and who Lance is(smile,Misty smiles at Ash tendering his hairs)..he is a record holder as the only man who has won a extra set and led Lance there in extra time just the second set very closely lost then the final Lance was too heavy...so you can see that and won first 4 regions Sinnoh,Sinnoh Frontier,Hoenn,Johto,Orange didn’t win,Kalos won,Unova by luck didn’t win deserved it and finally Kanto absolutely won so he was devastated in that situation and i did what i could do for all else in battle and all and as much in personal life but i was in similar situation as well and Chu was kept with mom then you know he loses it if i’m in danger and he won’t be jovial though he most certainly can like Yveltal or Noivern if with me cause it’s just that view of his that he must guide me and all and his bossing around Feraligator of course got and turned on me and then all these(laugh,Misty smiles at Ash tendering is hairs) anyway,Dave was aghast and i did what i could to protect him during battles and outside and Zara as you know same nature too simple sweet little girl and she understood that they weren’t right the legal side of Rocket and all then met Dave you know soulmates will come close and Dave was saved cause she realized his condition and all that this just 2 months into it then those atrocities weren’t affecting Dave cause just started then huge story both faced hazards and that stuff battle for human prizes Dave all the time had Bulbasaur and he just you know his nature only he could be given to another and he just was like 10000 Bulbasaurs and the intelligence and all decimated every electric,fire and rock dragon possible who were swelled up to max but Bulbasaur was something and Dave got the weeds out while Bulbasaur got the interference off and if not Bulbasaur then i had 2 ghosts or psychics who were with Dave and later Zara always had atleast two and all of my colleagues same in the end we were 11 Zara came those two to make it 9 and then another couple and another two persons they and the better half of the other couple they were battlers and thus we were 6 in the end and all of those 6 are having their honest life now though as you know Team Authority is behind them anyway,then Dave infact fought for many people to be honest all didn’t defect to us but total 13 excluding us 6 and Zara are now in honesty again out of illusion and all didn’t defect but were neutral in our favour and so on then many later now happy life and the greatest boss the most totally happy now absolutely as i said and he is a 1 time champ from Hoenn and 1st region was Hoenn but sadly then went to Sinnoh just his 2nd region and that was it and he is so happy now and so on all my bunch universal pester buddies for eternity(laugh,Misty smiles at Ash tendering his hairs) and then anyway Dave and Zara married the next month they came out and Dave is such a sweet child went out 2 weeks later to Kanto for next title(laugh,Misty smiles at Ash tendering his hairs) and i ever had contact with him and Zara was with Lucian and Tayla was more than safe away from profession and they i told you rich family and with Lucian and Tyala it’s just massive wealth and they have a son Hector 10 year now sweet boy they are like Brawn too as is Mr Eden and Mrs Jessica whole family is like that and so on and then Dave had same two months in Kalos as did i as you know i went according to my whims really and they budged Mist cause you surely know the bottom line why i’m tolerated and i play that only i’m a real cash cow for them cause they will be sent to cosmic darkness along with their bunch if they approached my bunch even non psychics the general pokemon connecting channels by that they will fondle them to abstruce vulgarity sending them to another plane not returnable so i can’t thus i’m the scapegoat as i have to save my buddies from humans and that’s the bottom line(laugh,Misty smiles at Ash and tenders his hairs) anyway,then you know that press conference beau vs bro differentiation and i by then was Gengar and Dave understood that confronted me said it’s not that there’s none in the world for you to forsake your human self,live for me and Zara as to us your obligations being a human will never finish in this life atleast thus don’t become a Gengar so quickly(laugh,Misty smiles at Ash and tenders his hairs) then i said even if your own bro you can shackle the body never the mind and then we understood that we’re brother’s for eternity and then he was ever beside me and so on and now at the farm first day office Elite4 Sinnoh i call jumped here i said are you out of your mind Zara you know like Drew to me as well but Drew i have a fool around relation Zara is sweet little sis like May and so really i’m so happy to have all of them here and they infact want to come here i’ll with my now power which only has increased cause i have resigned(laugh) and with that i will make the lab stupendus with my targetted 6150 arcs sending all the weeds out of Pallet making it a villege again and this area will have the Viridian forest totally covered up as preserved area only for our profession and thus we will need a pokemon centre ourselves and thus i want Brock to be here as well and well(laugh) i’ll drag him here no matter and Violet is just so naive(laugh,Misty smiles at Ash and hugs him very fimly hiding her face in his chest,smiling) and we both me and Dave were offered instant Hall of Fame after Rocket rejected both and thus if he wants Dave can stay here i’ll go to the gym anyway and mom either in lab of Cerulian and you know mom would herself offer this to Dave and Gary and Lillie infact needs a parent figure you know what i’m saying and Professor is 84 now and hence this you know Gary,just my twin bro and mom sees him like me since beginning and she will be too happy to be there and Lillie well(laugh) just will be on the moon cause that has been her only regret not having a figure like that and Brock i can’t tolerate a man like that cause it’s mandatory 3.25 years have had to work like this it’s not right and won’t be they will  be given surprizes not me or my Mist flower but that will be from my bro at the farm who will jump them i just told him your older bros Gary is twin and the sister in laws are my wife’s elder sisters only whole family just so naive(laugh,Misty broadly smiles at Ash hugging him firmly),more left sweetie i want you to beam even more(smiles and hugs Misty very firmly,Misty smiles at him and hugs him very firmly as well)..Dr Muk Skechit’s Muk inhibitation was under threat by Kanto Elite4 junior faction huge group and Hector Skechit was there his company was used to snatch away the bragging rights there and so on and the faction was sweared to hell cause i was angry that the vultures were stenching the place and first causing troubles everywhere here then Lance then that Lance told me later after that picture i saw of your’s the special nomination one i was incensed that i was foolish enough to not know my sweet Mist flower is my soulmate and 4 years i’m away from her so i knew after Lance said things about you and i decided to raid the whole world but sadly with Giratina and Ultranercozma(laugh) and then there itself forced Lance to tell me about the great Kanto vultures and he did so in return to his breaking his code and doing all for me i sweared the hell out of Kanto Elite4 everyone that Lance indicated the lobbies in the middle of night compelling them to listen to me and they pointed fingers at Lance for letting me off and that nexus stuff and all i said lets see what you can do when i selcet people and give them my bunch and they come into our profession to make it a monopoly at Kanto gym systems and i know a lot of people here who desperately want that cause they are fed up with your performances in the last 10-15 years and the start will be Pewter one of the most neglected ones sure you don’t want my Tyranitar of all right(laugh) and they knew about Sabrina and Gengar was fostered by her and the rest is understandable cause Cerulian could’ve hosted the most dreadfull 6 pack CrawdauntogatorlerSeismirottzel(laugh) Floatzel shows the difference between grounded water and watered ground(both burst into laughter) Samurott gives the soultion to swim at ground and walk at water cause the trouble is not knowing what’s at your left is at my right(both burst into laughter) then Seismitoad gives the final generalization that all trouble will cease if it’s understood that ground and water are interchanging each moment whare are you(both burst into laughter) Kingler recruits moles for my bunch to send them to Crawdauntogator(both burst into laughter) and those brats plan the doom and distribute it among many at the end of which all will oppose themselves only(both burst into laughter)..and Typhlosion also helps Kingler by insinuating he wants to stop running after desires(both burst into laughter) thus gets the type disadvantage of own type and of course the Grass,Bug and Steel and Electric etc infoes to serve to Crawdantogator to plan the impending doom(both laugh) and Crwadauntogatorlerphlosion and Seismirottzel are two universities who exchanges students for better experience so that on passing out they become like Gary’s Magmorter and Golem the best perfect professionally personal moles(both burst into laughter)...”
Misty(laugh) : “man,this is brutal(both laugh)..really Ash,you sure were in a too happy place atleast with these brats(both laugh) i don’t want any moles anywhere around the gym(both laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “then they will tell me we see that 2nd brat(both laugh) yeah you’re a brat too(both laugh) so 2nd brat starves in that gym serving his cause 2nd brat is not not male(both laugh) bunch substandard food to get them turn against her and thus stay depressed then when master brat goes bodyslam him most vigourously cause of this prolonged sorrow to get that moment most ENJOYING(both burst into laughter) we see too much bonhomie(both burst into laughter)..these pests are something really..”
Misty(laugh) : “i also get your antics as well(both laugh)..no really Ash all knows about that press conference..i just thought that my Ash is with someone else but he told all what he did just for me(smiles at Ash hugging him very firmly,Ash also smiles at Misty hugging her very firmly)..”
Ash(few moments later,smile) : “never in at no times(both broadly smile at each other,same pose)..”
Misty(smile,same pose,few moments later) : “right,and Ash just what to say so overjoyed to have a little bro and sis too(both smile at each other broadly)..really Ash i’m never without you(both hug each other very firmly smiling)..”
Ash(smile,few moments later) : “anyway back at Platue after picture,i just sewared the hell out of them and then eventually that inhibitation trouble people came to know as those opposing Lance were united disunited after me cause Sinnoh is run by me and Kalos will do anything for me with that money and Unova is Unova thus i have a monopoly here and the bottom line and the bunch and the antics and all the nature i’m really the most dreaded playboy to them and to me only my Mist’s boy eternally(smiles and hugs Misty very firmly,Misty hugs Ash very firmly smiling) from that first day at the lake to this image and also to my flower(laugh) then they budged and all this news is recent all surprize few hours later may be Gary is already alarmed to go there(laugh) Professor was told yesterday night in very brief and all then tomorrow surprize and Lillie will be over the moon if Daisyl is happy(both laugh) and i just love to get after DaisyDaisyl(both laugh) just so naive(both laugh) as is Lillie and Violet(laugh) and finally though Hector has been saved and came to know what Trace is finally and just too extremely overjoyed that the dumb jackal as ever is right so the whole family Mist with my bro if he wants and he will i know all at the lab at 6000+ arcs with 3 directors and Dave at Lomstom at 3 cities cup special hall of fame by means of earning it twice and will stay only here of course and Pewter will get everything and Viridian well Brawn is Brawn(laugh) and my flower will be seen as exactly as she is in the self so whole family Mist all here for you as the post order marital negotitaions in all due honesty of ethical honesty in morality of ethics of honesty in ethical honesty of ethics(burst into laughter,Misty beams at Ash with tears of joy in her eyes hugging him firmly,Ash tenders her smiling)
Misty(smile,same pose) : “Ash i’m just so so overjoyed from yesterday this time to that session 6 ours when i thought most darkness to finally now..(chokes in joy,both smile at each other and hug each other very firmly)..”
Ash(smiles,same pose) : “my sweet Mist dream...(both smile and hug each other very firmly,few moments later)..Dave and all else all huge stories you’ll hear and after Undercover he was then just a teammate for life but yet to be family same right after Undercover but later ever was like family both of them and i also had that feeling for them both and then during my Elite4 where i made my schedule you know they say once in a millenia and you know now that’s cause only nowhere(both laugh) and also the Dusknoir i have no moment can be pointed out as exactly now at this point thus time can’t be exactly pointed out as to what is the exact time now so all is flowing and unstable this 2nd master who also is a brat(both laugh) and not not male(both laugh) is time cause she’s unstable in emotions as to go or stay(both burst into laughter) Malamar said before sleeping she knew if agitated she will sleep now she’s sleeping but knows again will wake up and same emotions thus who’s sleeping while awake(both burst into laughter) who am i Malamar(both laugh) and these two ghostly pests were saying she wants to suddenly appear but doesn’t know to tickle before to get the land ploughed(both burst into laughter and fool around with each other a bit then again laughs and hugs each other firmly,few minutes later)..so you understand i was getting those in breaks while you were so sweetly dozing firmly in my arms(both laugh)...Mist you’re so so sweetie(both smile at each other hugging each other firmly)...after those words came from you like then am i extra to you i said as me but worded differently and then sleep powder and hugged you to death telling those brats make sure this sweet Gyarados doesn’t wake up i want to fondle her to death my sweet Mist is so sweetie(both giggle at each other hugging each other firmly)..anyway,so i had to get my ways with my Elite4 schedule but Dave got Kalos in same 2 months as me and i wanted to be a Gengar so badly and Dave resisted i told you before and then we understand your eternal sibling relation and we hugged each other that was formality and he has helped to work behind the wohle world’s back to get infoes about you and Cerulian and is at the farm set up many surprizes waiting for my bros here all in good times(Misty smiles) and he saw each he was my lackie here before i departed for Cerulian(both laugh) the last time i was here and all he is still office bearer at Sinnoh and hall of fame means very special and came here after 2 days of office cause it’s family to him and so on so yeah i’ve a bro and a sis as well(smiles at Misty,Misty smiles at Ash)..so all most important stories done now the biggest one being in 24 hours Ms Misty Waterflower becomes Mrs Mist Ketchum(both smiles at each other hugging each other very firmly for few minutes)..”
Misty(smile) : "but that is exactly Ash,even 24 hours ago we were oceans apart,what is made
you return actually?"
Ash(laugh) : "well i was living my life roaming around as a Gengar(both laugh)..whichh is what it is actually(both laugh)..but you know it now Mist just truely only now(both smile each other and hug each other very firmly smiling at each other,few moments later)..well so i was going around till i reached Lance,and then the aftermatch party,Lance having known me very well and being a constant support when Tyranitar forced me to REVOLT(both laugh) yeah my Shiftree revolts against being a Shiftree(both bursts into laughter) invoke a revolution from within to revolt against the same(both burst into laughter) cause the first revolution is to revolt against you the second is thus to revolt against it else that revolution itself will become you won't it(both burst into laughter) anyway(both laugh),so Lance has ever been kind and all and then at party rather in a personal manner asked me why am i doing all these publicity things saying strange words and so on,i just brushed him off and told him that no it's all right,i'm just enjoying the attention till it dies down next year itself,Lance rather compassionately said that he knew me for 14 years may be,and he's on his last 4 years of service and knew Professor very well,so if i want i may tell him what it was or if it was about someone or something and this cause he might be able to help me if such be the case,i don't know,he knew your condition and he knew we travelled together at a time,and we both were in hall of fame now in two separate departments,i don't know,may he be blessed always,but God really send him to me that day,otherwise Mist it's ok i would've been with Gengar at death but you in 3 months..my sweet Mist flower would've(hugs Misty very firmly).."
Misty(smile,tenderly,tendering Ash's hairs) : "it's ok Ash,continue"
Ash(same pose) : "just that day you said take your trophies back that you know send me the signal that it was about preferring my bunch and hence i never cared till that picture but sweetie you can't be you without me i knew it then but Mist i'm.."
Misty(smile,hugging Ash very firmly) : "it's ok sweetie,it's ok it was only you as me as it is and will be hum..my sweetie..(both hug each other very firmly smiling and continue for a few minutes).."
Ash(smile) : "right,um..actually you know Orange did give me the pungent feelings that i knew the reason wasn’t Trace(both burst into laughter) and those brats Danny and Rudy will remind me of you why not married the next day(both laugh)..anyhow then got grip over myself with my position and all never needed to do Kanto Lance invited and won’t say no to him so back to Lance,so he was saying those but then i just wanted to get out of this uncomfortable situation with a venerable old man,so i said can i just see the Gym Leader's hall of fame,i knew via Dave that you were seriously battling when he did Kanto Elite4 and then you got the hall of fame i knew too so i just said casually without much thoughts that i'll just like to know the history of Gyms at Cerulian,Pewter and Viridian,the 3 closest cities to Pallet in the 3 City circle,so Lance took me to a room,I don't know why he did that but um..he didn't have to..its just the Grace of God,i say..anyhow,first was Pewter and i just hovered over saying that yes that was my very first badge and the leader was very kind to me,well Brock had moved to a different professon,so he didn't know much,he just said was it Mr Kane Slate,i said no may be someone on the change i forgot his name,then he was about to show Cerulian i just quickly said ok i'll see Viridian first,he showed just Brawn(both laugh) and you know Viridian has a tremendous history with electric gym and that’s where i first got the feeling that i was atleast worthy enough to finish this region atleast cause Chu had the material to go alongside meand all and you know all of it first hand..anyhow much time spent there,in the meantime a few f.. b..(Misty frowns and Ash laughs,Misty sighs and laughs) were roaming around trying to distract me and i would've been absolutely love to oblidge to them and trash talk like i did in all other 6 places but this time i was Graced the third time by God as somehow didn't like the idea of much crowd that moment and scoffed them off saying i'll be extremely happy if they spared me for a moment here and let me peacefully to turn back a few pages of memory and i'll be most pleased to be excused then,which made them a bit flustered including Lance too i guess..given my antics for a long time at after final parties the 6 previous all were vulture bashing all time in crowd(laugh,Misty laughs as well),it really was something a bit difficult for them to swallow i knew the Gym histories in other places other times in my own interest not during formal dinners anywhere and well i never went to formal dinners unless it was official which only is in finals of Elite4 that is rather prestigious for the head and you know all was my handmade schedule and all there none that can actually dictate me anymore cause that's exactly what my brats are starving so much for(both laugh),but those were perfect antics spots to confuse everyone even more so that they think twice before mingling with me personally and i have a sway over them,but i never did it unless the Elite4 heads like Trevor and Persy themselves said lets bash(both laugh) which Cynthia didn't like so excused herself off from it(all laugh) and Unova you know is a mess anyway with 5 man committee and all so went full on there and Ivana told me to go less so i called a press meet at night(both laugh) and then Orange was Orange(both laugh) but Lance also did say go full blast only then did i agree to do Kanto to begin with(both laugh) and no never would to that much extent as he’s a man i respect as much as Professor Oak,anyhow,then i said even a more bitter thing to the vultures saying,i've known Lance for 14 years by now and if also they left him with me for a few moments i'll be most pleased and i'll also be extremely happy if i'm allowed a little bit of solitude away from the protracted glamour that comes from going through the whole world constantly for 19 years without a break through undercovers as well and lately without a break from public glare,then my tired body and mind could be much relieved and then i'll later some other day may be able to entertain them more thoroughly,which dispersed them off from us completely,Lance was taken aback a bit but must've thought just the memories of my very first Gym Badges reminded me of my very first teenage travel days..cause by then i read a bit of gym leaders rules and said ‘bro,did you know there’s 5000 other ways too for spelling the word Gym?(laugh,Misty laughs uncontrollably)..leader i see ilii to start and hr to end(Misty bursts into laughter)..what type of gym?..water..what type of water..unmoist salty tears(Misty laughs uncontrollably)..i see,yeah right recalled Sandshrew’s nails can’t stay intact for long in moist water(Misty laughs uncontrollably)..excellent in ponds though(Misty bursts into laughter)..um,sir..um(Misty laughs)..get off you buffoon do you think i’m an idiot,tell your brat to tunnel under the pond bed(Misty laughs uncontrollably)..sir!sir! That gym isn’t behaving properly..too many cheerleaders,i see(Misty laughs)..what type is it?..underground grass(Misty bursts into laughter)..hmm,can’t a Swellow work there(Misty laughs)..um..sir,Swellow in grass gym,isn’t that a dark type(Misty bursts into laughter)..no deep blue(Misty laughs uncontrollably)..and yeah about the cheerleaders,just tell them to replace with Jinx(Misty bursts into laughter)’..and i went to hall of fame water gyms with Donphan and Tauros but no Metapod(laugh,Misty bursts into laughter)..”
Misty(laughing) : “ ‘hey namecall which forsaken City(both burst into laughter)...sir i expect a more fomal language(both laugh)...i see,formal language...university ground?(both bursts into laughter)...sir i’m   sorry i’m from Cerulian City Gym a water gym with both pool and ocean water system...hmm..i see,but i think you’re being illegal cause in such a case the smell difference affects the battle(both bursts into laughter)...sir,i’ve to go urgency(both bursts into laughter)...right,um,hey namecall gimme that badge(both laughs uncontrollably)...”
Ash(laugh) : “some system these are..anyhow so Lance rather was happy and thanked me for driving the crowd away,then i told him with a bit of irritation to show me Cerulian now and I want to go to a solitary place after that to have a conversation with you privately(both laugh),and this godforsaken Cerulian's whole damn history of 1000 years(Misty laughs loudly)(laugh)..anyway(both laugh)..was thrown at my face(laughMisty bursts into laughter) and i just patiently bore a bit from 1000 to 900(Misty bursts into more laughter) but quickly lost patience and asked him how's the Gym doing now with the hall of fame,and that Cerulian was my second badge and i was lucky to get that badge(smile and tenders Misty) very lucky indeed.."
Misty(smile,tendering Ash) : "mutually in all ways,continue"
Ash(smile) : "and then i continued,as by then somehow your thoughts kept pouring down on me so torrentially that i just said i personally knew the Sensational Sisters there too except the current gym leader and how are they doing? so Lance told about Daisy a bit and Lillie too and Violet whole world knows(both laugh) andway then i said,and how is the gym leader doing too i understand she didn't want to face me not privately(both laugh) but that's ok except that how she? Lance might've got me there that it's exactly that particular gym leader who was bugging me cause the gym leader was my travel companion of 5 years and was not male(both laugh) which my bunch and me don't at all agree(both laugh) anyway,then he might've guessed that and thought may be the reason for my sudden stern behaviour with people and very kindly ordered everyone that may we not be disturbed at all for a few minutes and the place was emptied,then he told me about you and the Hall of Fame induction and all that is your last year then the nomination and afterwards and all in brief and i listened and realized well your professional life is going well atleast and then i asked well have you faced her Lance said no she is rather busy in these days doesn't do much hall of fame formalities just the gym is great doesn't do much travelling or much contact at a wider level here so i was a bit surprized as to why would anyone want to shield herself after getting the tag cause it makes no sense to do so after first agreeing to accept it second not agreeing to relinquish it,so anyhow Lance finished and i just said if i can have a look at the large sized recent Hall of Fame Gym Leaders pictures that i knew the fastest were held for a year so i was asking whether the current leader has been featured here or not,he said no the leader couldn't come just sending her written consent,so i said if there's any large sized pictures at all of the leader or not,and he said yes he had one but that was 4 years back when the Gym was registered in the most prestigious list at 2nd nomination being fastest and she has had her career as Sensational sisters was a huge star really and as good a gym leader so this one has been kept and all of these i was telling myself i know as well as her cause she was my grilfriend then(both laugh) so i was thinking just move it you so and so(both laugh)so i asked but i felt as you said that the leader is busy for some very serious reasons as well may be personally otherwise why would one want to shield herself after getting in hall of fame to begin with and just then he drove the first knail in my heart saying well you're right the current leader has joind the Frucient City gym with her Gym and now it serves a dual role so just that,i was a bit startled,well this isn't new but i certainly didn't see them in Kanto 10 years back which i saw in Unova and Kalos as well as in Sinnoh but all were due to matial reasons but still it was just that you will get two badges if you so want from any of the gyms and only a 1st nomination holders can do it among any of the two so i thought well you might've got married and all but i didn't want to directly ask that cause(both laugh) i knew i wasn't the other half(both laugh) so said,well that must be nerve wrecking work,to which Lance's face did turn a bit concerned but you know you can't talk about these things with anybody no matter what your personal relationship is,so Lance just said she manages it..so i said is it like saturday open Lance said with additional hour added each day having the Frucient gym totally shut now only official and other works go on there so i was scared actually when he said 8:30-19 for 6 days for almost 2 years by now so then i directly asked Lance that if it were so that the two married and one changed the profession ause i've Frucient badge was a hall of fame during my Kanto travels at Frontier was my very first badge after i started now 11+ years back and the leader then was 64,Mr Jerry Jefferson and he isn't anymore among us sadly for 7 long years that i know too so is it something like that with the next one and thus made it a single facility Cerulian being second category nomination,to which Lance said well,no the leader there Mr Jefferson nephew in relation,just relinquished it after being beaten by her in a battle,i got more interested and said is that legal,to which he said that it won't be possible for him to tell me that as that'll be against his code of conduct,i thought well it might be a shadowy game with nominations and all and you og all people with illegal things i couldn't believe it and so a bit desparately said that look Lance you know me and i know you what is it then Lance just solemnly said no we consented cause Ms Misty Waterflower was personally tormented rather and had to take this step cause didn't want to get to the courts as the bet was if she loses she will be demoted to 1st category whereas the opposition is propelled to it and hence the illegality was not caused by her but rather the opposite was,we consented cause if he lost he would've had to surrender his license for next 5 years and will be banned with bunch snatched away for the same number of years except the starter who still can't be battled and must be kept with the bunch which only your lab has,now your ever-pouring thoughts by then had taken a bit of a toll on me and this just put the fire in the heystack cause the only thing i recalled was my sweet Mist flower first telling me way back in Orange 16/17 years back after she picked up her name being extremely good that,'um..Ash today..um..they linked you with me i just laughed them off but if this goes on..' so this i realized as if the whole world was waiting for me to get out of their path to treat my sweetie as shuttle cock whereas the match was about her stardom and i was incensed so i just lost it and straightaway said what i totally forgot in the preceeding 4+ years in a way as to your name as i said became synonymous to any so and so and hence i never bothered despite newses coming in my ears pictures being visible to me and so on but this made me incensed and so i directly said,look Lance Misty was my girlfriend for 15 long years after which we broke-up and yeah she was my girfriend from almost the first sight at 16 infact we confessed to each other in the very first week at Viridian Forest itself(both laugh) and before first sight she saved me in that forest lake from the possible drowning and so..(laugh) here here here..(burst into laughter).."
Misty(bit irritated) : "What now,Ash?"
Ash(laugh) : "just the vultures Mist i can see them so eagerly waiting to land on this spot that has suddenly become visible to them(laugh)-the vultures are insinuating that i'm with my childhood dream who saved my life and brought me back to life- oh! her beautiful face,oh! her sweet.."
Misty(sigh) : "Ash,i know how much these thoughts disturbed you,but hey we're married now,do you have to validate yourself even now"
Ash(laugh) : “no really Mist if you want you can prepare yourself to see in men and also me all stool and..”
Misty(loud voice,frown) : “ASH!just shut up!i’m your wife!stop this..”
Ash(laugh) : “no really it’s so funny that childhood dream stuff..”
Misty(hugging Ash very firmly and smiling at him) : “my Ash is my dream for eternity not any form just me is my Ash..(both smiles at each other)...”
Ash(laugh,few moments later) : "though ask Brock for the answer on vulturized questions (Misty sighs)..no it was only the first round,today even more(laughs,Misty laughs as well)..anyhow,i was saying that the answer is no,because i didn't exactly think she was pretty or sane then(Misty laughs).. cause she is my sweetie(hugs Misty very firmly smiling at her)..."
Misty(smile,tendering Ash's hairs) : "especially now(both broadly smile)"
Ash(smile) : "right.so basically i didn't put any thought at all to her,rather she followed me..this one done"
Misty(smile) : "right!back to Lance"
Ash(smile) : "right,so i said,since then we had had our relationship but broke-off long ago but it feels extremely irritating to me even now cause she is a nice person no matter what went between us and this i saw first hand ages back at Orange when they linked us up and we used to laugh at them denying and enjoy it later during our personal times(both laugh) so it just feels bad as if her stardom and all has harassad her so much even then and still doing and all and i guess she still is a very kind gym leader else none would do the extra day and still all this she faces which was one of the reasons why we broke off as well clash of egoes..attitude(squeezes Misty's cheeks then Misty does same and then both laugh)..so i said,i'll just be happy to know if she is married now or not cause 15 years and off certainly hurt me a lot then same was for her i guess so just curious as to if this is about these or not,then Lance said as far as he knew no she wasn't,but by then as you see your bug has smitten me beyond repair(both laugh) and so after i knew the status of eternally Misty Mist Waterflower Ketchum(both laugh) i again said if i could see her picture,i'll be very happy..he by then realized what is what(both laugh) and so he showed me
your picture in a room and prudently left the room just after just leaving me there excusing himself of urgencies and mentioning a person to guard the door and except for him not to allow absolutely anyone no matter who..and Mist that was prudence otherwise i wasn’t in a stable mood and my chu-bro realizes me well,if then i did something of a physical skirmish and then they bettered me obviously and i felt physical threat and despondency,chu-bro would’ve thunder chaired the whole world and he would’ve himself set upon all my other Pokemons present on everyone..they’ll get absolutely mad if i die before them due to other persons or pokemons and they have to see that then none will spare themselmsevs and you know what their power is if they are in that mood- so yeah that’s true prudence and anyhow i’m the biggest name in Pokemon world anyway so there’ll not be a more important man in that building anyhow..still great prudence..anyhow i kept gazing at your picture that i didn't want to see in the last 4 years despite seeing,it was 4 years ago but that was really by then
even more heart wrecking to me as i recalled 4 years back we still were together and yeah that was last 5 months during my Unova your 2nd special nomination and yeah were talking like twice a month but still i had my Mist without illusion then(both smiles at each other in same pose)..anyhow more than these i just kept gazing at your picture..and i just couldn't leave it or take my eyes off and unknowingly tears came to my eyes..it was a full sized picture,you with a V pose and i just touched the V you made in the pose,well it was a big sized picture but i brought it down Via Noivern and told him to hold it right in front of me and as he did i touched your hand made the V and just kept staring ,and Pikachu just kept staring at you and looking at me..and those goddamn vultures if were there..those bufoons..godforsaken..”
Misty(frown) : "Ash,you truely have become a pest,why drag vultures such beautiful description,i need to tutor you for long.."
Ash(laugh) : "coach,remember Massy at that Fire contest?"
Misty(frown) : "what's so funny about that?"
Ash(burst into laughter) : "Mist!Mist!Mist!Mist! still won't let anyone to say hi to me
right?"
Misty(frown and scowl) : "what was that Ash?"
Ash(laughing) : " ‘Ah!you saved my Pokemon,i always loved this type of brave and kind man,we need to discuss our future,are you free in the evening..a date?’ |’um..excuse me but he's booked’|"says who?"|"ME,MIS-TY"|"ah!Mis-
ty!are you his girlfriend?|"blush and flustered,um..no..um..i'm his coach"|"
Misty(smile) : "you still remember,it was i guess 14 years back?"
Ash(smile,poem) : "the very first sight Misty her name/the heavenly flower with only one claim/that me and she are one and same/soully ever you Mist,just call me by your name”
Misty(giggling,hugging Ash firmly,Ash also hugs Misty firmly and smiles) : “Hum..beeing on poems now my sweet sweet bee(both laughs)?”
Ash(smile) : “for my flower talk(both laughs)... i went to Cerulian for my second badge with my travel companion Misty/14 years little girl always wanted me to obey Misty/fooling around,fake fighting all to make me know Misty/finally Cerulian turned out the yougest Gym leader is Misty/she would fight me with a face so cute in anger to tell me she’s Misty/after that still followed me cause a bike owned by Misty/later my girlfriend the ever sweet flower Misty/but now I know no words just YOU’RE MY SOUL-MY MISTY ”(looking at Misty who was beaming,both keep hugging each other firmly beaming at each other)...
(song,immitating,Misty’s goodbye song)

Goodbye
But now that's such a hard thing to say
Now it's time to let go
But I never thought I'd feel this way
Promise not to be sad
But we both knew I was lying
Gotta fight back the tears
'Cause, can't let you see me crying
You're more than just my best friend
(smile,shivering voice)
What makes me Misty most of all
In our final curtain call
Is knowing that I won't see you again
(tears..little)”
Misty(little tears,hugging Ash tightly,smile,whisper) : “Ash,i’m just here why bring that..”
Ash(wipes off his tears,hugging Misty firmly,smiling at her) : “um..very sorry sweetie,disturbed the mood..but(smile)..still heart wrenching..but (smile)..finally...um..(laugh)...finally i’ve got the answer to all vultures that dared to write this and that deluded me to be away from my Mist for 4 years...(tears,Misty hugs Ash firmly,smiles at him)..um,it’s ok..anyhow i’ll describe...
(song immitating but even before start flustered)..(very stern)..just a sec Mist..(Misty a bit concerned)...just a sec..(extremely stern and grave,Pikachu is suddenly out of sleep very alert and grave as if he also has experienced something very pungent and dangerous)...(hugging Misty firmly)..just..just give me a moment..
Misty(hugging Ash firmly,solemn) : “Ash,your Misty is your wife now,your soul,you yourself are your Misty,we were just having fun..come on Ash,the by gones are by gones..please..Ash..”
Ash(very stern as if some memory playing in his mind and he’s trying to totally devastate them once for all,hugging Misty firmly,shivering but firm and low voice) : “yes,that’s the thing..but i recalled no its just a thought..a possibility..a chance..a unit of web of complex thoughts that either makes or breaks one..just a moment Mist,please bear with me..Pikachu sleep,not a trouble..(Pikachu goes back and keeps looking at Ash intensely.)...all those days in Kalos libraries at night time only me,chu-bro and Ganger the rest of the world never knew...would pick up the few books...sit go to an empty space turn the lights on..study while those two play..life and death,fooling around and crying abound,eternal bliss perpetual gloom side by side..amusing is the result begotten..everfree,evereffulgant,evercontent..that’s actually what actualized and established my intuitive and abstract conviction...but this vulture..i’ve probably didn’t cook carefully..(smile)..no i get it now...(laugh,grin)..i get it now..no damn vulture can pass me,my soul...lets play then..(grin)..lets play..
Misty(solemn,hugging Ash tightly,keeping her head on his chest) : “Ash..for me please stop it..we will go to Viridan Lake tomorrow..just you and I..and no it won’t be a goodbye..you are your Misty you know that,we’re soulmates Ash,just brush this one aside..for eternity they can’t separate us..nothing is their except us..it’s all our own fooling around play...we’re ONE just an illusion as being two/i want to see me to have me as only being you..remember..please Ash..” 
Ash(stern,smile) : “yeah Mist,i’m sorry that i’m giving you more pain..but please just this one,it’s very dangerous if this damn brat remains...(laugh)..now i recall...

(song immitating)
I close my eyes and I can see the day we met, 
Just one moment and I knew:
You're my best friend, do anything for you.

We've gone so far and done so much 
And I feel like we've always been together.
Right by my side through thick and thin,
You're the part of my life I'll always remember.

The time has come,
It's for the best, I know it.
Who could have guessed that you and I -
Somehow, someday, we'd have to say goodbye.

(bursts into laughter,Misty hugs Ash firmly tears..)

Misty(tears) : “Ash,you’re making me cry..why suddenly..”

Ash(wipes Misty’s tears off hugging her firmly) : “i’ve got it Mist,finally..(bursts into laughter but shivering voice,tears)..death,huh?!?..death..physical death,social death,emotional death,mental death..and contacts...that is also death..(laugh)..the vultures so sweet they thought this would be untenable,unshakable,unbeatable,unbearable...IMPOSSIBLE..(bursts into laughter and tears,Misty cries hugging Ash)...(very stern,firm but shivering low voice,tears)..don’t cry Mist,nothing but us..and this is my answer. To those dam brats...(hugging Misty very firmly)...

cutting off all bondages every bit of it/i don’t care i don’t care,i just don’t care a bit/i’m free,i’m free nothing’s never not me/i’m all,i’m all,anything else did flee/without me without me things will never exist around/but among all there’s Misty with me ever abound/i’m the sky never dependent but there’s the thing/my freedom is the same as Misty is my own being/i don’t care what if’s,i don’t care to explain/i’m clear,perfect wisdom of my Misty’s contents/there’s all i’ve dissolved i’ve conquered all/if i want nothing else will exist nothing at all/Nothing exists including me in no form nor did or will/i know the rest let me now circle Misty wheel/Misty’s a name appearing a way which the current me/i’m Misty,Misty is all,we’re you can see/Misty doesn’t hinder me,i don’t care she or he/I’m Misty,not my fault i see Misty as thee/I’ve crossed all the turns,nothing except Misty/this then becomes inevitable my second form is Misty/i’ve done what i could to test and test Misty/i knew it’s my refection its what’s Misty/i’ve cut everything else who else but Misty/with me unto ever is there is Misty/it’s inevitable the end i don’t see anything but Misty/i’m sorry that i’m Ash if i’ve to say Misty/I told the contents there’s nothing no/neither me nor Misty,reality is so/i’m Ash i’m bounded just so is Misty/my bound her bound I’m Misty just Misty/hereby Must known be it that I’m all and Misty/without me no Misty as you see I’m Misty.
(Pikachu intently looking at Ash,Ash exhausted of emotion,shivering still hugging Misty firmly..Misty stopped crying looking at Ash with a broad smile,hugging Ash)...just a sec Mist,that was only the first..those brats..i will finish it now more radically...
I’m impossible to describe as you see so is my Misty/I’m impossible to comprehend as you see so is my Misty/I’m impossible to fathom as you see so is my Misty/I’m impossible just I’m and I’m my Misty/I’m me and that’s Me,yes as my Misty/i’m now Ash Ketchum thus also my Misty/this all is what it is I and my Misty/It’s the same what am I,is that I’m my Misty/I’m here bounded detached but i’ve my Misty/I’ll play what i’m as will my Misty/again and again if here is me and my Misty/this is this as what is me and my Misty/difference in unimaginability still me and my Misty/doesn’t matter what is there,reality is me and my Misty/this all is what it is I and my Misty/It’s the same what I’m,is that I’m my Misty.
and finally i’ve  got the higher radicalized version..you know just goes on infinity level in radicalization,just a piece(Misty beams,Ash smile at her and both hug each other firmly)
Ever present ever existent,i’m what i’m/my name you said Ash Ketchum,but i’m what i’m/not bounded by my body or the mind or even the soul/i’ve got nothing to say,cause nothing can describe my soul/i’ve got nothing to do,nothing to be,nothing to rue/i know who what i’m,forever free,free from rue/the only way to realize me,is who you call Misty/I’m that,I’m that,just take a look, I am Misty”

(Ash smiles at Misty,hugging her very firmly..Misty beams at Ash,hugging Ash very firmly...they hug each other for a few minutes)

(MISTY SINGS HUMMING WHISPER)

Misty(humming,hugging Ash firmly,Ash is also hugging Misty firmly,both smiling at each other) : 
“

Goodbye
But now that's such an easy thing to say
Now it's time to let go
But I ever knew I'd feel the joyous way
Promise not to be sad
But we both knew I was lying
Gotta fight back the joy
'Cause,I don’t want to show my playing
You're my Own Being...
(smile,tears,Ash hugging Misty very firmly and smiling at her,Misty hugging Ash very firmly,whispering,singing the rest of the song in Ash’s ears)
What makes me Misty all and all
In my soul and my all
Is that I’m my Ash forever,
again and again...
(smile,tears,Ash also smiles and tears rolling down his cheeks,Ash and Misty hugging each other very firmly)..”
(Ash and Misty stay hugging each other firmly smiling at each other for a long time)

Ash(smile) : “Our Final goodbye,for this time,as usual..what’s up in next one(smiles)?”
Misty(smile) : “First we’ll be ONE and ONE and then for your next part i’m your Pikachu(both smiles)”
Ash(finally laughing) : “but i won’t be your Godly(both bursts into laughter)..”
Misty(smiling) : “why suddenly Ash?”
Ash(smile) : “no you know what i was just running through what i told you during our dating session at noon(both laughs)..just recalled i go way away and you get frustrated and so move way away with those who won’t go away...(bursts into laughter)..what a night this(laugh,Misty smiles)...then i recalled what i read once..contact,contact,contact..(laugh,Misty smiles)..you know Mist(laugh)..i just should’ve said the the day you were singing the vulture version of the one you sweetly sang,so beautiful(Misty laugh and then beams at Ash)..that i remember what i read that day...’where’s contact if there’s only you?’...then i realized that i’m Misty and that’s it so that..but you went ahead..”
Misty(smile) : “yeah,that is what it is Ash,i realized you were desparate to say ever no matter what...so i said i or you-death doesn’t matter,yeah i don’t want the pain but(beams) just doesn’t matter(smiles)..I’m Ash and that’s it...”(both hug each other firmly smiling at each other)...
Ash(smile) : “but still you know i don’t like this heart-wrenching it’s rather inevitibility to me..why bother when unison is ultimately what you want?”
Misty(smile) : “you can only have the highest heart-wrenching if you do have had or are established in the very unison only Ash,it’s just a play you know the end..”
Ash(smile) : “absolutely..i’ve always thought about this death,death,death,rather frustrating..thanks Mist,certainly very clear now(hugging Misty firmly)”
Misty(smile,hugging Ash firmly) : “as usual”...(they stay hugging each other and smiling at each other for some time)...
Ash(smile) : “yeah once souled ever souled”
Misty(smile) : “soully true”...(they again stay hugging each other and smiling at each other for some time)
Ash(laugh) : “now finally i want to roast that goodbye crap(both laugh)..cause i really want to go everywhere with it..(both smile)..by the way all this and more to come forever at 15..had to smack each other(both bursts into laughter)..
here it is->
(immitating) 
I close my eyes and I can see the day we met once more, 
Just one moment and I knew:
You're my soulmate,i’m nothing but you.

We've gone so far again doing so much 
And that’s just again as we've always done together.
Right by my soulmate, playing through always,
You're all of my being as I laugh at the word remember.

The time has come,
It's just to take a break,I know it.
it’s time to pack up this one..
for the return to next bit,where i’ll fool you the first time..

(both smiles)...(hugging Misty) yes,death is laughed off but so is life cause it was already said that after death anyhow ONE..so rather useless is both life and death,mere wordplay..but being what we are,alive,lets play(both smile at each other)..but you know next time i should always say i’m booked(both bursts into laughter)..am i wrong?"
Misty(hugging Ash,smile) : "who should answer?"
Ash(solemn) : "Mist,i wish i could understand.."
Misty(looking at Ash and showing her ring,smile) : "Ash,i've this now remember,as usual?"
Ash(smile) : "just i could say those words you said,'i'm booked',but i just didn't
want to create a fuss.. that's all you know but then..nah! let it go,vulture business(both laughs)"
Misty(smile) : "right Ash,remember my name,but Ah!your ring i.."
Ash(smile,showing her another ring) : “just a second Misty(putting it aside,Misty looks a bit surprized)..you were talking about coming with me to Unova,regardless of whether i go or not keeping in mind the hellrounds and your dreams what if the everything you want is refused intentionally(smiles at Misty looking into her eyes)..”
Misty(a bit shocked looks into Ash’s eyes,then a bit dejected,then a few moments later broadly smiles again looking into Ash’s eyes and hugging him very firmly) : “yes,your final filter Ash,i understand,yeah..(hides her face into Ash’s chest hugging him very firmly,Ash keeps smiling at her)..it’s fine dear,just fine,yeah i won’t be happy if i look at that in the first few years from today may be but Ash(looks into Ash’s eyes smiling,Ash too looks into Misty’s eyes smiling)..i just want you dear that’s all-only and soully(hugs Ash very firmly and hides her face in Ash’s chest broadly smiling)..”
Ash(smiling at Misty finally hugs her very firmly) : “sweet Mist flower,soully(both keep hugging each other for few minutes)..that can come only if there’s body what if we surpass that level along with the mental level hum..won’t that be most lunatic and fully maddening..(smiles looking at Misty as Misty too looks at Ash smiling)..”
Misty(smiling at Ash and looking into his eyes,both same pose hugging each other very firmly) : “always with you ever with you and yeas my wish also matches Ash,i wanted to kiss your head off since the very 2nd day and do that each day umpteenth times and later when you used to return after 2 years,i didn’t want to stop that whenever i saw you..but Ash(looking into Ash’s eyes broadly smiling,Ash too broadly smiles looking into isty’s eyes,both same pose)..just as i went close to you since day one it’s just..it ever felt that any physical adoration wasn’t enough to express my feelings towards you it was so overwhelming and just lost myself in that in your presence and forgot all just didn’t want to do anything except hugging you and keep hugging you for eternity and that really was it..now i know it’s all cause it’s just me im my Ash..i can’t express my soul that is my Ash..so i just lost myself in that supreme happiness whenever my Ash was with me or even the thought of my Ash all time..(hides her face in Ash’s chest smiling,Ash smiles and both keep hugging each other very firmly)..i am full only with my Ash noting else..yeas dear,soully in luncay with you,with me..ever(both keep hugging each other for a few moments)..”
Ash(smile,same pose) : “same for me Mist,i ever lost myself in your presence and that made me forget all the body and else you ever came too close to me all time(laugh,Misty smiles) but not once did it feel awkward or not once any body and all popped up never the feeling of physicality just wanted to be beside you all time and if you weren’t physically present just your very thought without memory or anything just my Mist this thought was enough for me to hold onto all time and i was so happy personally cause i virtually saw you all time and thus never felt being away from you hence you and my professional life never collided and same for you and dealing with pokemons and not inanimate objects or ideas or living but unintelligent beings helped us in that sense immensely..we ever were at each other’s presence dear and hence i ever wanted just that as well never any physicality and hence even that obligation at present and i know with my state will for a long time feel excruiciatingly difficult cause my Mist is something else to me and her current form is included there..just my sweet Mist(both smiles hugging each other very firmly for a few minutes)...(showing the ring again to Misty,Misty beams looking at it then at Ash,Ash also broadly smiles at Misty)..waiting for my flower to fit it in my finger.."
Misty(looking at the ring,then looking at Ash) : "Ash..this is.."
Ash(Misty is fitting Ash’s ring) : "yeah(laugh)..the Cerulian brats thought it’s a mandate according to public gospel that it’s only one way traffic(both laugh)..infact men need it more than women during the time of proposal for obvious reasons of responsibility(both laugh)”
Misty(fitting the ring in and looking both looking the mirror,smile) :"Perfect,but Ash,the size is.."
Ash(laugh and hug Misty) : "i’m cunning enough Mist atleast inside my room(both laugh) you were sleeping in my arms only each and every time(both laugh)"
Misty(smile) : "Ash..this is..my dream come true.."
Ash(smile and hugging Misty) : "still the first part of the two"
Misty(broad smile and hugging looking at Ash) : "Ash.."
Ash(smile) : "no rush though,we've got ages to fix the timeline"
Misty(smile,shivering voice full of joy) : "you want everything then?"
Ash(smile) : "sweetness turns bitter if it’s tasted again and again..hum,same as after Sinnoh Mist flower..(smiles at Misty and Misty beams at Ash then hugs him very fimrly smiling Ash also hugs Misty very firmly smiling)..all in good times Mist,future and else,all in good times..."
(both keep hugging each other very firmly for a few moments)
Ash(laughing) : “besides Mist,we were 21 by the time Johto finished,now 35 already so many births and deaths in battle and gym..(both laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “then you also were undercover(both bursts into laughter)..”
Ash(smile) : “just a thing sweetie you sure know the bro vs beau differentiation(both laugh) did it somehow worsen those stuffs for you..”
Misty(smile) : “no that actually made me stronger in thinking that if you can so can i but i couldn’t and then after a month or two the others started you were travelling around and undercover you were in so much variety and me being there at gym and show and all that same old stuff so the ideas of something else came to me all for my Ash nothing else(both broadly smiles hugging each other,few moments later) but(laugh) what a protection against Kalos(both laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “and i had Quizzy Rayquaza make a dragon so(both laugh),Giti the obvious(both laugh),Cozy is Ultracozy(laughs,Misty bursts into laughter) so these brats all time with Beehie,Hoopa,Banette and (laugh) Yveltal at pressroom on that occasion(laugh,Misty bursts into laughter) no Yvelie was outside others were in still UltraCozy(both laugh) that brat is something you know(both laugh) was at team rocket abjectly abused for 2 years only an Ultranercozma or a Giratina or a Latios could take that you know,Goodra and Zygarde are of a bit different type being ground only i ever consider them so cause their bodies are huge and hard they can bodyslam as good as Snorlax can but can't surely(both laugh) anyway,Cozy faced me twice before the third when she switcheed over after very first month and may be a few weeks and since then was with me few others were there too like a Jirachi was but went off later with others and all Cozy was extremely intelligent even then and you know with me and my approach to them ever only my soulmates stay and come to me others not this life(smiles,Misty tenders Ash's hairs smiling broadly at him) so she stayed then after that went to lab one month totally spoiled alongside obviously the obvious Gengy(both burst into laughter) who told everyone hearing my countering methods during the Crawdauntogator final planning before the team rocket final to end our plan as,so lets TICKLE to be COUNTERING(both burst into laughter) i knew the brat is totally mad anyway(both laugh) and Cozy said so many types these HUMANS(both laugh) some ever happy some ever sad master brat if happiness and sadness and all different types are only of me why am i of only 5 and not only me(both laugh) some brat that is and actually my bunch got even more extremely intilligent after she joined cause being at team rocket for 2 then 6/7 may be 3 years she knew so many things that otherwise we would've had to really take 18 more months at Kalos and then would't have done Elite4 would've stayed at Kukui lab and only then do it cause we had to understand both me and my bunch those things so Cozy fastracked our system really by 1.5 years and thanks to team rocket for that i ever say(both laugh) and all my bunch is taught via travel companions and else to know when i’m talking and all if that is a not male(both laugh) then Chu can get my different feelings towards not males and now if there’s inconvenince in me around them or anyone(both laugh) well now all can thir intelligence is at the same level no difference even Mime same you know soulmates to each other by all means as well(laugh,Misty smiles tendering Ash's hairs) so these circles 1,2,6 ft are set they know me and what i expect(both laugh) you were never told as not male thus you’re not not male(both laugh)..but they will call you 2nd brat and especially Chu will say along with Crawdauntogator that 2nd brat waiting at gym to bodyslam master brat the wait is to intensify that MOMENT,prolonging the wait to increase the joy,cunning(bursts into laughter,Misty uncontrollably laughs)..with their carefree nature they have to cogitate on something to be alive and sane and happy human beings would take up philosophy etc they can’t and knows only that so vulgarity is the thing for them and all these are in mental battle days were used to rile up opponents which are only they themselves(both laugh) and to us it serves the purpose of forgetting the body and the mind then(both laugh)..wicked(both burst into laughter)..anyway,so back to Lance, then i kept looking at your sweetly Mistyvious picture(both giggle at each other) and so Pikachu too just kept staring at you and looking at me and was very excited and was saying a single thing consistently,he you know understands me as well as anybody and he himself was happy to see you again after a very long time and he was always on my shoulder except the moment during breakup,you know he doesn’t understand break-ups and all cause his worldview is totally different,but probably he must've felt something as he used to see you all the time or hear you during our phonecalls and all and then we didn't call and all that for a very long time,so he was happy and pointing to your picture in a low voice started constantly saying one word "Pikachupi!Pikachupi!Pikachupi" his word for "MISTY"..and i just felt like i was looking at something so familiar yet so far as if i was touching something kept in front of me yet the touch felt like as if it's lives million lives apart..as if i knew somehow a million years ago in
a life many many lives ago and shared infinitely many memories that were so precious that i just couldn't move after all these many years later and despite my internal bliss of the joyous memories that i might’ve shared,it was only covering an unfathomable darkness that i'm touching something long gone no matter how joyous it’s just memories it can’t be revived anymore it’s DEAD..this death was unbearable to me as i just realized that it can’t be dead somehow but no matter what it just can;t be death and death made no sense yet this idea of death as if was cruelly grinning at me and devouring my being completely..and Pikachupi flet like a warm breeze hitting my face constantly,without ceasing but it was sweet yet that darkness as if was only cruelly veiling it’s lurking teeths that were about to tears me apart and was licking it’s lips in the impending and inevitable joy as soon as i fall...and tears automatically rolled down my cheeks profusely i later found out..and(bit choked)..it was then i first had a glimpse of what you really are to me and what i’m myself..there it actually felt like it's only me million lifes ago yet so far away and it's as if just another type of body that i had and i've ever so longed for a grand union again just to get rid of all bodies and differences thatt is imaginable to the one permanent existence consciousness that i truely am..and it wasn't like looking at your own 5 year old picture,it was something way way stronger than anything i ever have heard,read,seen or experienced that i can relate to..and yet it was so natural..i forgot actually i can't really describe what i did see but i didn't see flesh and blood at all there or anything related to you,i didn’t know if you were Misty or whatever i just knew that it was me only me but this idea of death cruelly was hindering my realization and as by then i had become habituated to by analysis to separate out flesh and blood and ideas and all and no i didn't even remember any good things that you may've ever done to me or who you were etc,Pikachu's
words and this picture had given me the realization that i never imagined,i just realized as if someone firmly but gently speaking in my head in my own voice and exactly the first moment i herd this voice i conquered that idea of death,the voice said- "MISTY-that's your soul,you are that as well and the difference you're making is only your own illusion,you are Misty and Misty is you,no difference is there,see it for yourself"..and I don't know how long i stood there or i just didn't want to part,i just got overjoyed and the tears just became of joy unlike a few moments ago...i had an intuition of soul as being indescribable but i felt it then and there it self...i on one hand realized i’m truely the soul and all else word and things are nothing and simultaneously you are also part of me or you’re only me myself..i was my Misty indeed and this intuition that Misty is inside me not out here finally got tangibly vivid beyond doubt for me but..(laugh)..here here here..”
Misty(deep sigh) : "Ash, you're also a Disaster Master!why break this moment up?i was seeing that as well.." 
Ash(bit puzzled) : "um..sorry..but(laugh)..i just realized now that if then,exactly then some vulture dared to be around and this is another God's Grace that they didn't,but if they did and disturbed me or gave the scene to the press,i would've been very happy to set at that very moment all of my pokemons on the vulture if i was even remotely disturbed then or my moment went public,but God didn't let that happen out of the infinite compassion,so all vultures were saved and No,Mist really,if i didn't get you due to some vultures roaming around then disturbing me,my name would've been written with blood then and there and i knew nobody present in that building could do anything about me or my pokemons actions and it wouldn't have been nice and i would've become a real nerve wreck then as i would've tried to push my pokemons to absolute ultimate,killing them and myself in the process..now so hopefully vultures showed some intelligence there and saved their godforsaken lives and MINE as well..anyhow..vulture is a good name i.."
Misty(frown) : "Ash,i would like that the infinite compassion be helpful to you in restraining me from smacking you the next time you suddenly drag vultures in a most beautiful scene,continue now" 
Ash(laugh) : "alright,alright,so the vultur..um,no don't do that(Misty lightly smacks Ash's head),its
ok(laugh)..so sweet in my flower’s sweet sweet touch(Misty frowns and mocks smacking then laughs,Ash smiles)..ok do that always but gently.."
Misty(sigh) : "Ash,please you.."
Ash(smile) : "ok,ok,bare with me,i'm just back,so i was in this trance like state and then i was brought back to my senses by a Gentle hand on my shoulders..it was Lance,and i also recognised that Pikachu had long stopped uttering your name and was constantly looking at me,so i just
suddenly was brought back to my senses and looking at Lance was just startled and didn't know what to say,in the mean time Noivern put the picture back and came beside me,i called him back but i had no words at all in my head,then Lance very gently broke the silence saying,in his words->
Lance(kind face) : "Ash! you alright?"
Ash(stuttering) : "um..it's all right..i just..um.."
Lance(kind face) : "Lost in thoughts?"
Ash(thoughtfull) : "yeah i guess"..age related(both burst into laughter)..no really Mist this is so funny cause each step of thought these brats will pop up sadly(both laught)..Orange just that blooming youth(both burst into laughter)..what brats i have..anyway,
Lance(kind face) : "Ash you've been standing like this for 15 minutes at least as i've entered here and was just observing you and i left you here 15 minutes before that,so it must be 30 minutes there or there about.Ash,the tears"...and then i suddenly realized i cried a lot and quickly wiped off the tears and..
Ash(thoughtfull) : "um..no it's alright Lance..i just.."
Lance(kind face) : "Ash, it's alright,i know her well,Misty Waterflower,the yougest of four Waterflower sister from Cerulian City Gym and the current Gym Leader of Cerulian City well your girfriend for 15 years indeed was so when i saw you two 14 years back surely(both laugh) and.."...I don't know Mist,but suddenly this past tense word - "was"..became too unbearable to me and i burst out in a bit of choked but high pitched voice-
Ash(bit choked,bit high pitched) : "Please,enough!"
Lance(kind face) : "Ash.."
Ash(flustered) : "um..sorry...but she's still alive atleast this i know you said was and it just felt a bit..um..well.. awkward,anyhow um..sorry for shouting at you Lance..i'm terrib.."
Lance(kind face) : "Ash,it's all right,you were wanting to know more about Misty right?"
Ash(concerned) : "Lance it's ok..i'm terribly sorry i just lost myself it's alright it's been 4+ years and.."
Lance(firmly shrugging off) : "Ash,i know you very well son and hence i have an idea that it's only her memories what is bugging you for couple of years now especially given just after that may be you were undercover and hence your public behaviours later and i realize your position and 15 years too and no she isn't at all alright or in a happy state as you may not know and this is for atleast since the Frucient fiasco and that's two years already but there's much more to that,i will tell you about Misty Waterflower from Cerulian City Gym and Frontier symbol all that i reliably and personally know,but you must stay here tonight as we have to finish with this,you've been absent from the dinner for too long,you must comply with me"..see i took the chance because..please this is just jokingly..i politely asked Lance if i could mouth the press off and if i sweared may he spare me,Lance smiled and said that he himself will get rid of the press and will finish the night as quickly as possible and besides not much was left of it..so,anyhow i couldn't thrash the vultures then and there for their campaign to ruin my personal life and helping my self illusion over my soulmate my sweet sweet Mist flower(tendering Misty,Misty smiles and hugs Ash firmly)..and so again Lance saved himself and vultures..thus it happened..then i just returned to your picture and Noivern kept holding it and i kept gazing at you,i did it just to recreate the moment and Lance happily obliged"
Misty(blush a bit) : "um..Ash,i may again have to face Lance personally very soon.."
Ash(smile) : "na,it's alright with him,your’re like his daughter just a bit older i guess and he did treat me as his own son all time,it's alright,but here you must bear with me again as i want to contrast the reasons why other people thought we're made for each other"
Misty(smile) : "ya,i would."
Ash(smile) : "alright,Lance told me as i was again tendering the picture,that what you were upto with your activities and overwork,suddenly turning on the Frucient Symbol for pestering you and then creating legal skirmish,besides that brat himself told me his whole life history from previous few lives as well(both laugh) bit by bit like other few brats did whom i spoke of and those 4 brats right at the beginning each brat came to know what happens if you pester someone’s wife only cause she is so sweet inherently that can’t show you your anatomy in choised language and this brat most cause he was at Karapaskar for an hour with Giratina and Ultranercozma(both laugh) and before or after i can't recall but was with Gengleye this i do recall(both laugh) for one more(both laugh) Giracozma showed a day in the life of a chosen college suspended Giratina(laughs,Misty bursts into laughter) and Ultranercozma went there inspecting colleges and logically showing them how the courseworks needed to be totally revised as it currently does rather a disservice to a bigger talent pool forcing certain type of courses only like responsiblity of being a Giratina but not how to object against it(laughs,Misty bursts into laughter) or doing so against being a Giratina to being with if a dragon why not also the type of a Flygon why the universities don't exchange rather shy students(laughs,Misty bursts into laughter) and Gengar tickles and Sableye compels others to act like him and Gengar(laughs,Misty bursts into laughter)"
Misty(laugh) : "thank God i didn't get GitiCozy(both laugh) but i got the full wrath of those two tickling pests for keeping them serious for 7 hours(both laugh)..”
Ash(tendering Misty's cheeks,smile) : "No Mist,i shouldn't have left you just like that to those vultures,not as a boyfriend atleast...i never realized how much monkey business went around my sweet little flower since the day she returned and those m.. were sentimental fools...(Misty frowns)..just wait till i step foot in that place,they’ll not be able to sleep for a week with what i’m just going to tell them first day itself(Misty laughs)..i’m only getting started and now i’m soully Mistyvious(Misty smiles)...”
Misty(hugging Ash,smile) : “Ash,it’s all right you know,don’t strain yourself,i’ve forgotten all those now that i’ve my sweet soulmate..nothing matters now no matter what they do...just don’t get so anxious..but(laugh)..i know you’re not going to stop atleast on the first day no matter what,what are you gonna say..?”
Ash(laugh) : “the first thing after formal announcement where i’ll show my power and give all that to you showing what you are to me grossly so that the bufoons may know it’ll be dangerous to mingle with this Gym given your power now and more importantly my public image and antics,then i’ll just threaten them that if they still pester too much,i’ll take up all that power by virtue of my marriage and make Cerulian Badge a must win with 2 at a time for 3 FULL ROUNDS (Misty laughs),which means death to any number of legends as you know who’ll start for me(Misty laughs) and the next rounds are Seismitoad who says water and ground is turning into each other each moment don’t you feel so(laugh,Misty bursts into laughter) and Samurott who says land is to be swam and water to be walked cause what’s left to me isn’t that at your right(laugh,Misty uncontrollbaly laughs and fits of laughter and in tears laughing) then will come the dragons Palkia and Kyurem to tell you that circularly you don’t know yourself cause you weren’t born before knowing yourself(laugh,Misty burst into laughter) if this wasn’t enough i’ll change the gym into a fire gym(Misty bursts into laughter) one on one with Volcanion(both laugh) who doesn’t understand the difference(both laugh) and all the while keeping all water pokemons exactly beside the fire types that is Typhlosion who says won’t running after things never stop in retardating life like Buzzwole says eat can’t breed so only-sleep wake-up repeat(both burst into laughter) and insinuate that my flying fire types and all will be so(Misty laughs) are not getting free roaming,unleasing them on the damn city and there will be Talonflame of all in lead who flies while telling the whole world that his method and flight is all wrong(laugh,Misty bursts into laughter) and Pidgeot stays permanently now says yeah wings big deal but why flying is important at all if you know what it is(laugh, Misty laughs uncontrollbaly in fits of laughter) i can walk but if food served like Mr Skechit with a human face does why bother even eating he will feed me anyway if i make his Scyther attack me by insinuating he hasn’t evolved thus beau range is so small(laugh,Misty laughs uncontrollbaly) fires with all those water types and all and if still they don’t budge i’ll set a herd consisting of count(laugh,Misty laughs tendering Ash’s hairs)
Gengar,Sableye,Marshadow,Banette,Hoopa,Darkrai,Malamar,Dusknoir,Spiritomb,Mismagius,Confragigus,Gourgeist,Aegislash,Chanedlure,Giratina,Ultranercozma,Decidueye,Jellicent,Glalie,Rotom,Deoxys,Musharna,Unown,Meowstic,Beeheeyem,Gardevoir,Celebi,Bronzong,Reuniclas and Uxie(both laugh)-30 ghost dark psychics who are abolute once ever pests at bedrooms(all laugh) civic bedroom with host Giratina and Ultranercozma(both laugh) that simply means they’ll die from either laughter or insomnia(Misty laughs loudly)..and all these will be supplimented with properly prepared trash talking(Misty bursts into laughter) where anything they do will be proved as an insinuation that they’re trying to harm the gym,trying to pester the gym leader to the extreme,abusing their own pokemons,etc and if all this didn’t stop them my final word is that the bade will become Seriousness Badge(both laugh)...the vultures must understand and distinctly digest(Misty laughs) the fact that the Universal Water Empress has her chief minister with her,who is 60 dark sided plus himself(Misty bursts into laughter)..”
Misty(laughs) : “God bless Cerulian(both laughs)..Gym leader’s life is nasty Ash,but(laugh) when you step in..(both laughs)..may God save all eternally(both bursts into laughter)...and i guess the electricity department...(Ash nods and both bursts into laughter)...”
Ash(laughing) : “Dark Night:Cerulian Challenger Version(both laughs),yeah to Gengar the open desart under mid day sun is Dark Night:Constant Strong Light Version(both bursts into laughter)...anyhow lets reminisce,shall we?”
Misty(laugh) : “Dark Night:Already Morning Version”(both laughs)...
Ash(smile) :”right,so Lance told the stories and all about you and your recent problems,i almost instantly knew that all you were doing was only longing to see me and was entrapped in a golden cage with the huge responsibility of polishing it everyday,so you finally resorted to your pokemons and gym and frontier and all else and it did get you in Hall of Fame but you weren't all right and then those stuffs which Daisy complained against you and then he said they were thinking of red flagging you the next challengers said your bunch isn't behaving properly nor you and you weren't in very last days there were slips here and there Sarah told me but this was just before i first called you out via press and she knew why i was there and also why you were in such plight hence didn't do anything and also then Lance went on and told me about your present state a bit just that you’re playing hide and seek thinking of my Ash only(both smile at each other) and then i said look i just want my girlfriend back plain and simple whole world knows my contributions despite my name the questions and all(both alugh) i only ever wanted Misty Waterflower current Cerulian Gym leader in my life to be mine and had her for 15 and then for atleast 13 of it her feelings exactly matched mine and thus i will get her back by any means cause my primonition is that she is that she is only thinking about me too hence may be other relationships aren't suiting her either but would you help the behind the back stuffs cause she won't date me atleast if already with someone else no matter what her state is if that's the case and won't have an appointment either else would've agreed to let me in the gym when we first contacted so would you help,which he agreed to but then despite knowing my abilities and Team Rocket history tried to advise me which i’m always blessed to be bestown upon EXCEPT when it comes to my sweet Mist flower cause he said that you have picked up a bit of a bad name recently cause a few recent challengers 4+ or 5+ have already complained about your bunch not being in a good state and they suspect you have made your hands dirty especially just after getting the Hall of Fame entry with illegal business and that itself was the way how you got into hall of fame they suspect and also this same tag will thus now protect you even more,as soon as he said illegal and then cheat,i politely said that i helped busting team rocket and i've had enough experience with illegal things given what my bunch forced me to use to keep my nerves sane(both laugh) which he said he just cautioned me because he thought i liked that picture cause it brought back my great memories with my very long time girlfriend but i might get a rude awakening,i politely said if he gives me other protections that just lets me to mingle with the press there and do my things and fool around without those brats from police,i'll do my maximum but i said please i don't want to hear a word more on the past,present or future(showing the ring,Misty laughs) Misty Waterflower cause i've had nothing but only just her as my full personal life for 12 years atleast and hence i know her which i belive and only she again can break it so please then Lance realized it and just patted me..so then i set things up with Lance,came out for the first week gauged the whole situation around you..then planned went to Venturiastrog which university lecture i attended twice to confirm my realization after my sweetie’s picture came to me yeah at lecture halls 3 in total i attended which had in teams of 2- MetaLatiDollQuazaHydreiTal(laughs,Misty bursts into laughter) anyway,then at Kalos there a brat challenged me with a Lugia as i said this match was fixed by Persy,Kalos head as he was requested by that lunatic and he i guess is a runaway from Unovan legends gorup i used Muk who said like,if you hug your beau despite they not liking your to much advances i’m myself inviting you to hug without any evil intentions don’t be so infatuated with beaus(both burst into laughter)..that was it of course(both laugh) and then returned and got you back that’s all(both smiles at each other hugging each other very firmly).."

[2 hours later]

(Cilan Calls,both bursts into laughter)

Ash(laughing) : “i got it Mist,just watch the fun..(both bursts into laughter)..”
Cilan(bit concerned) : “um..hellow Ash,sorry to disturb you but...”
Ash(frown) : “is it a personal sweet talk sweetie at 8:00 in the morning here(both laugh silently) as i’m in the mood or is it not?(both bursts into laughter silently)”
Cilan(angry) : “so,already on the spot then(Ash and Misty bursts into laughter silently),fine i just..”
Ash(laugh) : “Brock told you a few minutes ago and you got so overjoyed that forgot to watch your watch and came check my room where i was dying from loneliness(both bursts into laughter silently)?”
Cilan(sigh) : “Ash please,you know me i couldn’t be happier if..”
Ash(frown) : “what is it that exactly bugs you Cili,my happiness or the restarting date(both bursts into laughter,silence)
Cilan(sigh) : “Ash,please you have all except your personal happiness and this foolish self created misfortune of yours wouldn’t have lasted even for a month if you weren’t idiotically stubborn enough to never call ‘mam back even after your antics during undercover(both bursts into laughter silently) hearing the danger that you were in,a random anyone would get a shock for life what to speak of someone like ‘mam who is so gentle hearted even in genral(both laughs uncontrollably in silence) and you know exactly well why it was solely your own responsibility to contact ‘mam just after the day you were nonchalanty rude enough to talk extremely harshly to such a kind hearted person and do all your drama of break-up(both uncontrollably laughs in silence) and it always will be your fault only to refuse to contact ‘mam again and again simply given who ‘mam is and her responsibilities outside of her personal life(both uncontrollably laughs silently)....you just took everything for granted cause your home town was close to the great Cerulian City(both uncontrollably laughs in silence) and you had your friends there and yet you just never bothered to even talk properly with them when such a person like ‘mam ever considered you so wholeheartedly and all ‘mam ever wanted was that you don’t continue your antics in public circus called after battle parties where you were never invited(both laughs uncontrollably in silence) and that too in front of press(both laugh silently)..you..(sigh,both uncontrollably laughs in silence)..just tell me whether you’ve had the minimum intelligence to atleast properly beg pardon from ‘mam(both laughs uncontrollably) or whether you still are thinking that because in one call 4 years is brushed aside why should i care(both bursts into laughter silently)... only a person like ‘mam in this world full of what you know more than me(both uncontrollably laughs,silence) cause you were obtruding them(both laughs uncotrollably in silence),only a person having such generosity like ‘mam would ever remember someone like you who dosn’t understand anything except how to perfectly thunder chair all(both bursts into laughter in silence) for only the right reasons and infact even give you a chance to say sorry properly(both uncontrollably laughs)..do you even understand properly that no matter what you did in your travel days and how much you tormented ‘mam then(both bursts into laughter in silence) for the last 10 years atleast if not more there’s no woman that’s more skillfull and gracfull and kind and generous and who has all the right qualities in infinite quantity in her(both laughs in silence) than ‘mam and you were lucky eneough out of all to have a place in ‘mam’s heart cause you were travel companions where inevitably ‘mam showed you how to battle and lead life(both uncontrollably laughs) and you taking that chance think you can do whatever you want and just go around at all gyms,trash talk make public scenes and i even heard you have recently created a fuss in Cerulian as well(both laughs uncontrollably,silence)...you..(sigh,both laughs even more in silence)...i’m just wasting my time again(both laughs in silence)...just tell me that you’ve not joked with Brock and also weren’t joking with ‘mam too increasing her pain even more(both laughs uncontrollably in silence)..you’re the sole reason why ‘mam couldn’t continue the show(both laughs in silence) and infact you’re the centre of many people’s wrath of that only(both laughs uncontrollably in silence) and if that wasn’t good enough the whole Cerulian city itself isn’t happy with you(both uncontrollably laughs in silence) cause i heard the Cerulian Gym too isn’t in good condition cause ‘mam’s health hasn’t been alright for a long time and ‘mam rather in these days aren’t so happy despite getting into hall of fame which only ‘mam could do in such conditions if they’re true and that ‘mam has much mental pain now a days as it’s heard around and i of all surely know who the culprit is(both laughs uncontrollably in silence)...just tell me that you’ve patched up with ‘mam and isn’t again fooling around with ‘mam in such condition(both laughs in silence)
Ash(solemn) : “hmm..i see Cili i’ve no place in the fans hearts(laugh,Misty bursts into laughter in silence)...but no what you heard is true with one small problem.”
Cilan(sigh) : “that you’ve already created a fuss in Cerulian just after the patch up(both laughs uncontrollably in silence)...Ash,look you don’t have any match in the world as long as pokemon battling is concerned except ‘mam who’s much better(both smile and hug each other) and unless your sort out your personal mess you’re only ever going to remain unappy cause professional challange is just about non existent for you...do you understand anything that i just said(both bursts into laughter in silence)?
Ash(solemn) : “no Cili you’re right but the trouble is far deeper you see Cili i trash talked ‘mam(Misty bursts into laughter in silence,Cilan sighs) and challenged her into a gym match that she abjectly lost(Misty uncontrollably laughs in silence)..which means professionally i truely don’t have any match Cili do i(both laughs uncontrollably in silence)?”
Cilan(frown) : “yeah win for sure definitely with that irritating illegal Noivern of yours and of course with thunder chair(both laughs uncontrollably in silence),where would you have been without your gang full of lunatic pests(both uncontrollably laughs in silence)? And such gems i saw my self coming all by themselves to you names we revere and what they became with you Giratina a psudeo legendary ghost dragon and comes to you later asks me this moment i am happy as soon as i say that the moment is gone so at this moment why i’m less happy(both uncontrollably laugh in silence)what’s your name and why the differences are so stark(all uncontrollbaly laugh in silence)..and in 4 years you taught that supremely intelligent pokemon to read your nervous and facial expressions minutely asking me of my name(both burst into laughter in silence) that’s your contribution to his life(both uncontrollably laugh silence)..and yeah that Goodra(both laugh,silence)..psudeo-legendary psychic dragon world feared asks me to count the days since when i’ve been serious(both uncontrollbaly laugh in silence)...Or was it those two unforgiveable water pests who doesn’t even understand the difference between a human and a pokemon(both laughs uncontrollably in silence)...anyway,then taking this chance you recited your 4 year diary page by page to ‘mam(both laughs uncontrollably in silence)?”
Ash(solemn) : “um..yeah,by line yeah(Misty bursts into laughter in silence,Cilan sighs)...but you see ‘mam has a second cousin named Misty Fletch(Misty bursts into laughter in silemce) ,and while i was walking out of Cerulian after fixing my first date with ‘mam at Safforn(Misty bursts into laughter in silence)...i kinda um..well..um..you know..well..(both laughs uncontrollably laughs in silence)..”
Cilan(frown) : “again were up with you antics(both laughs uncontrollably in silence) and thinks this Fletch who whoever(both laughs uncontrollably in silence) because her name matches also with ‘mam lets go and give a bluff to Brock and have a dance or party also showing ‘mam that you’ll rather have a deal(both laughs uncontrollably in silence) cause now you’re all victorius and have come back after 4 years,that’s your story then(both laughs uncontrollably)..you..(sigh,both laughs uncontrollably in silence)...
Ash(solemn) : “Cili,why is it that you think Misty Fletch is inferior to Misty(Misty bursts into laughter in silence)..Waterflower?Waterflower but the water got into Crawdauntogated Darkleyeness(Misty laughs in silence,Cilan sighs) and flower went to Misty newly(Misty laughs uncontrollaby in silence,Cilan sighs) and overall got abjectly ketchumed in battle(Misty laughes uncontrollably in silence,Cilan angry) that too with water types..ketchumed water...(Misty laughs uncontrollably in silence)...that brat Gyarados huh..14 years..legendary..i asked your ‘mam this Gyarados is with her for so long so whether she knows when will the offsprings of her 1st grandgeneration’s childern will come cause i want one(Misty tears from laughter) then your ‘mam made a face and said ‘um..sorry but the helpers know better’..this is her aptitude in Gym handling...do you realize what i’m saying?(both bursts into laughter in silence)”
Cilan(angry) : “yeah,definitely,flecthing the WHOLE world(both laughs unconrollably in silence)...but you should remember that this time ‘mam will teach you a lesson cause you’re spoiling her little cousins too(both bursts into laughter in silence)...so having fun then hey(both laughs uncontrollably in silence)..Ash..you..”
Ash(solemn) : “Cili it’s serious matter i cherish Misty Fletch infinitely more than your ashed-watered you understand(Misty laughs uncontrollably in silence)...she’s my choice now if you want to talk with her i’m conncting to her cause she’ll listen to me the WHOLE night unlike your flowered watered ketchumed mistyed whatever...(Misty tears in laughter)...”
Cilan(frown) : “Ash,have you actually patched up with ‘mam(both laugh silently) ?”
Ash(solemn) : “went there,battled,had a chat,felt like patching up,fixed the date,saw and spoke with Fletch Mist(Misty laughs in silence)..um..well...um..(both laughs in silence)..”
Cilan(frown) : “decided to not to patch up?”
Ash(solemn) : “right but you see Cili,still the SAME family(both laughs uncontrollably in silence)..AND NAME(both burst into laughter in silence)”
Cilan(angry) : “Ash,i don’t want to get involved in your personal matters no matter how much i respect ‘mam but this frivolity of yours in relationships is what got you into trouble before and will again.do you understand me?”
Ash(solemn) : “Cili,you managed a gym twice...isn’t it so that there are so many challengers very good  then there’s a few among them with whom you keep contacts and later see how great they become in career,but Cili,you surely know that there are a few challengers whoose 1st pokemon itself tells you that you’re seeing a person with an X factor..that moment of joy Cili..that moment of magic and you know there’s something..i’ve been with your abjectly ketchumed ‘mam(Misty laughs in silence)..and we weren’t in a relationship when i saw Misty Fletch(Misty laughs,silence)..so it wasn’t a big flower deal at all(Misty bursts into laughter in silence)...but that moment,Cili...the first moment i saw my Mist Fletch.um..Cili..Cili..(Misty laughs uncontrollably in silence)..”
Cilan(angry) : “i see spotting at first sight(both bursts into laughter in silence)..you’ve surpassed all expectations Ash,congratulations(both laughs in silence)..what’s so special about this Fletchy of yours(both laughs uncontrollably in silence) that you could(both laughs in silence)..you..(both laughs uncontrollably in silence)..(sigh)..i know how dense you are(both laughs uncontrollably in silence) in reality and it’s not easy at all for girls to get up to you no matter what you show(both laughs in silence) it can be an arranged affair as well(both smile at each other) ,just tell me that she atleast is involved professionally in pokemon world(both laughs uncontrollably in silence)...”
Ash(smile) : “thanks a lot Cili,thanks a lot(Misty laughs in silence)and no she’s not at all involved professionally(both laugh in silence and Cilan sighs) but way more intelligent than whom i’ve professionally turned to ashes in battle and that’s the reason(Misty bursts into laughter in silence,Cilan angry) anyway Cili she wants to come into our world professionally and interested in Pokemon breeding and i told her a lot about you and you know how much i FEEL for you my sweet sweet Cili..(Cilan angry and sigh,Misty bursts into laughter in silence)...cause Brock doesn’t like me Cili(fake sob)...(Misty laughs uncontrollably in silence)...so no i don’t want to hear any excuses being a professional and my friend you must talk and so i’m sending you to the spot herself(both laughs in silence)”

Misty(clap and smile) : "Bravo to vultures(both laugh),no first you abducted me second we married third we had to pass a sleepless first night due to hoot-hoots..(laugh)" 
Ash(laugh) : "see vulture is a better word"
Misty(smirk) : "Its vulpic,only that you're not allowed to use it"
Ash(smile) : "right(phone rings Violet),Violture got the never blocked number time(shows phone,bursts into laughter,Misty shakes her head again laughing)

take too much strain"
Ash(smile) : "greeting Mrs. Violet Waterflower Slate,it’s a truely such great honour to be able to speak to you,how may an insignificant being like me come into your service?"
Violet(emotional) : "um..Ash it’s ok but Brock.."
Ash(smile) : "dear Violet sis,i just told him that i also was suffering as much for Mist,but wasn't sure if she really was my soulmate or not no matter the years just like her and also told him about the papers whoose antics you know infinitely more than me"
Violet(crying) : "Ash,it was amusing what Brock told me that you said,i should've been there as
well.."
Ash(laugh) : "it's ok Violet,you know all of it anyway but still if i somehow have come
to your service then our another Violet-like performance is enough for my consolation if i was
ever rude to you or Brock or to anyone here.please take care don't get too emotional,it's ok,your my sister-in-law now,you’ve helped me with my Mantine infinitely more than anyone else ever have had and will be and i spoke to you most among my elder sisters as well it’s ok we'll have ample time to discuss anything you want...please give your best in your performances without any worries we all are here just do what you do the best"

.....(Misty and Delia downstairs)...
Delia(bit concerned) : "dear,you look a bit worn out.."
Misty(smile) : "um..no just too much talking,i'm habituated though,Gyms are hard places.."
Delia(points out Misty's ring) : "so happy,Mist,your officially Ketchum now.."
Misty(giggle) : "thanks Mom.."
Delia(bit concerned) : "did he fetch that before.."
Misty(bit ashamed) : "yes,Mom that's what he did"
Delia(bit concerned) : "he has changed completely in these 4 years,too playful and carefree and his language is a bit too abstruse even comparing to what it has ever been since he turned 15(Misty laughs,Delia too smiles)..but isn't polite at all i can sense.."
Misty(laughing) : "um..sorry mom for laughing,um..as you said is exactly true about his language but he’s just a bit rough with all that has happened to him in 4 years..he's just a bit tired but won't what he’s upto till he is satisfied(laugh)"
Delia(concerned) : "well,he surely knows how to scare people"
Misty(laugh) : "that i have to agree with,but it’s ok mom,you know him too obsessively frank as ever and the press has only pressed that button breaking it hence these arragements(laugh),it’s ok mom,just needs rest(smile,Delia broadly smiles and pats Misty)"
Delia(smile) : "sure with my honey surely he will be(both smile) but Mist,when are you going out today?"
Misty(smiles bit shakyly) : "um..you mean date?"
Delia(smile) : "right."
Misty(nervously smiles) : "well..we haven't decided on that yet.."
Delia(frown) : "Mist,is everything all right,you can and infact should be frank you know.."
Misty(laugh) : "no mom, don't worry at all,he's as sweet as ever,just a bit
tired,you know the press hasn't been kind to him,so he still just thinks that he has to logically
validate every moment of his life and give it step by step in a logical manner to anybody and everybody concerned in a rather colourful way and this whole process in his mind will give the
press a good beat-down whom he refers to as Vulture(laugh)..um,sorry.."
Delia(smile and concerned) : "no it’s ok Mist i understand..i see,no my little Ash never could do anybody any harm but i guess you should get this trash talking checked,it's not at all good"
Misty(smile) : "i'm being right at it but it'll take time,he had just been living a lonely life,it'll just
take hime some time to come into terms with his new surroundings"
Delia(smile) : "but enough about him,how are you,my sweet honey?"
Misty(giggle) : "fine mom,just fine" 
Delia(looking at Misty's ring holding her hand) : "very beautiful.but Mist,you should take rest as
well,you youself weren't in a good health and much emotion overnight.."
Misty(smile) : "i'm fine mom,i've had too many sleepless nights because of the Gym and other things,i'm habituated like that for the past 14 years,rather last night was the best sleepless
night till date"
Delia(smile) : "happy to know my honey,but um..Ash might also not be prepared to take you
out as he thinks that the press.."
Misty(laugh) : "um..sorry for laughing mom,but it's just the effects of his antics throughout the
night..i've been entertained beyond imagination,but no he has refused to take me out on a date or to dance or giving me a flower bouquet-refusal in all accounts"
Delia(very concerned) : "my God!..what's the matter.."
Misty(laughing) : "he would rather runaway with me to unknown destinations"
Delia(smile) : "too much imagination(Misty bursts into laughter),besides Mist,he's fine at home."
Misty(smile) : "mom,its just that press bug that's bitten him for such a long time and to such an
extent,he just can't yet get over it,so thats his definition of complete solitude"
Ash(outside) : "Mom,food,and overwork that little Mimey of yours, don't let my Mist work,she's...um,i just want her with me right now"
Delia(smile) : "also my Mist too(Misty laughs),remember that,and leave Mimey alone"
Ash(irritated) : "mom,please,but,if you don't allow me to um..well..gaze at my Mist all i want from..um.. close quarters,then i'll get Mime to batlle,there you little brat.."
Delia(frown) : "Ash, that's impolite,and leave Mimey right now."
Ash(wrestling with Mime,comes near) : "Mime is pestering me ever since..why you little brat, you're no good for..mom where's my food?"
Misty(surprized) : "where are you going?"
Delia( taking Mime away,scowl&frown) : "Ash wait there in the table,Mist will take your
foods there,and don't runaway with Mist so quickly(laugh)"
Ash(dissapointed) : "yeah,so you've also decided that i should be away from Mist.."
Delia(frown,comes to Ash) : "what's wrong with you honey?calm down, your always too
agitated,too active all the time,Mist is coming,let her prepare the dishes.."
Ash(irritated,sitting) : "Mist come quickly,and why can't Mime prepare the dishes and no i'm a bit excited and yes,i'm going to the farm"
Delia(frown) : "Ash,just wait here be calm honey,i've got to ask you something"
Misty (comes with dishes) : "here are the..(Ash tries to take off the dishes and hug Misty)
Ash,what are you.."
Delia(frown) : "Ash.."
Ash(hugging Misty firmly) : "Ah..that's what i want my sweet sweet flower,and no going a bit later.."
Misty(scoffs) : "Ash,mom is here,stop this!"
Ash(hugging Misty firmly) : "mom knows i’ve ever had only you in my mind and that too as my wife only and nothing else so it's never has been a vulger.."
Misty(hugging Ash quickly,then scoffing) : "that's it.Ash,are you out of your mind?calm down,don't
make a fuss"
Ash(sitting down) : "no i'm done,will eat very slowly and sorry mom and Silence"
Delia(frown) : "Mist,just sit down honey"
Misty(smiles) : "yeah,just these things.."
(finally everyone sists down)
Delia(observing Ash) "Mist,can you tell me something,I don't know much about training and
battling but i do know Mimey through and through,what is wrong with Ash?"
Ash(dejected) : "Mom your not insin..um..suggesting that.."
Misty(angry,shouts and scoffs) : "Ash!just eat silently!"
Delia(very concerned) : "Mist,please,why is he behaving like this,and no it's not just now since
the day he has returned,he's been like that,Mimey's too excited all the time and wants to play around
so does all else,Pikachu seems pretty indifferent to Ash,what is it?these Dark
Types aren't good Ash,you know.."
Misty(smile) : "mom,please calm down i'll explain everything..no Ash,not you and you're not leaving till i'm finished,Pikachupi,come to Misty,baby(Pikachu junps to Misty),right,and No
Ash you're staying silent"
Delia(bit shivering voice) : "Mist.."
Misty(smile) : "Mom,we don't have anything to hide from you but it's a kind of a trade secret..he's
a very special trainer and hence he's so important to the world.."
Ash(scoff) : "Mist is in.."
Misty(frown) : "Ash"
Ash(grim) : "very well,but mention yourself,she doesn't know fully that except Unova you’re the best in water pokemon gym leading"
Misty(frowns at Ash,back to Delia,smiling) : "Mom,his view of his pokemons have been that he must become them in order to know them as well as himself and thus as he has grown up in all quarters he is at this level where as you said his pokemons are doing things totally independent of him and his presence alone gets Mime to be so happy and that’s all cause he wants to fool around all the time you know the mental battling phase during Unova with Tyranitar(Ash and Misty both laugh) that has propelled all to hight of pwoers no more can be done for them in this body thus too happy knows the inevitabilities and like ideal perfect human happy life living in own being thay are such in pokelife(both laugh,Delia smiles) hence these behaviours and all and Ash has same view just that he had to finally marry me officially after 19 years(all laugh)"
Delia(bit concerned) : “but Mist..um..Chu..”
Misty(smiles) : “no mom don’t worry,Pikachu is an exception due to his own temperament and he
can't be automatically affected just by Ash's presence,he has to be be warmed up cause he is his starter and ever has bossed around him as big bro(all laugh) thus is rather critical now that he doesn’t battle(all laugh) so he's indifferent it seems and he's also able to catch Ash's nerve states independently,he's just irritated with him that he's always playfull and not battling
anymore,Pikachu is a once only pokemon himself like all of his are but being starter he is different like your Mime..”
Delia(bit flustered) : "um..well..i see but he must be lonely.."
Ash(bursting into laughter) : "of course he was lonely but now (smile) he has his
flo(Misty frowns)..umm(showing Misty the ring,smile) I HAVE MY MIST FLOWER (smirks at Misty who shakes her head) but when too lonely,which by the way i would if you or Mist don't bear with me and i don’t get to hug my flower all i want(Misty frowns at Ash,Ash smirks)...and both of you don’t bear with my now much beloved language which took 3 years of very hard work to process(Delia and Misty sighs)..(smile)..yeah right 3 University Lectures on the subject soul and saw some souls in lecture room itself as well(all laugh) and that was general public accessible so(all laugh),then unless i have my WAYS(laugh,Misty shakes her head laughing,Delia too laughs) i'll become more playfull and so would Mimey,so you see i have a deal.."
Misty(frown) : "Ash,stop that,don't talk like this with mom."
Ash(grim) : "but i'm not harm.."
Delia(smile) : "no honey,you never can but are you not going to obey your mommy because your all
powerfull now?"
Ash(blush,solemn) : "mom,what are you saying? you know what i'm.."
Delia(smile) : "absolutely honey,i do,just remember that press will not be after you unless you yourself wish them to and even if the press is around you still you don't have to give rigourous motives behind your each actions get it?
Ash(grim, dissapointed) : "yes mom."
Delia(smile) : "are you dissapointed with that honey?"
Ash(laugh) : "nope."
Delia(smile) : "that's my sweet boy.by the way,and no not you Ash cause you won't have any control
over your language as you're too excited,Mist will herself in detail say about her success with
Pokemons"
Ash(grim) : "huh! then basically i should.."
Misty and Delia unison(laugh) :"Shut Up!(both laughs)"
Ash(grim) : "fine"
Misty(smile) : "um,mom i've also been accepted into Water Gym Leader's hall of fame and like him
i'm also among the top.."
Ash(frown) : "is toppest"
Misty(frown) : "Ash, didn't we agree that you'll be silent?"
Delia(sternly) : "Ash, don't pester her(Ash and Misty laughs). say Mist"
Misty(laughs) : "um..(smile) yeah,i'm also among the top water
pokemon trainers and Gym leaders in Kanto"
Ash(whinning) : no i'll interrupt every time,she is THE IN THE 6 REGIONS,no
please Mist,bear with me,please.."
Delia(smile) : "ok Mist,i'll bear with his language,besides i must know what my little daughter
has done too in details(Misty smiles),please Mist,this time, let's just bear with him together,but Ash,if you cross the line,i'll not listen to you for this entire day"
Ash(sticking his toungue out to Misty) : "yeah!"
(everyone bursts into laughter)
Ash(smile) : "Mist is currently THE TOPMOST water pokemon gym leader in 6 regions barring Unova but i'm having to add the dreaded term ‘may be’ still as long as whole of 6 regions are concerned as otherwise the vultures will insinuate that(Delia and Misty shake their heads)(smiling) yeah, that's my eloquence(Delia,Misty both laugh)...anyhow,the vultures will insinuate that there are 6 godda..um..sorry..6 regions in this world where things are vastly different,Cerulian,a name that i'm not too..(Misty frowns) dissapointed about(Misty laughs) as it's associated with my sweet..(Misty sighs,Delia laughs,smile)..ever sweetest sweet sweet sweet Mist flower(Delia laughs,Misty shakes her head and laughs),being a seaside city-open ocean in fact-its kinda easy,kinda
natural,kinda understandable,kinda taken for granted that the Gym,if there is an authorized one,will be a Water Pokemon gym and if Levender had a water pokemon Gym then suddenly to the vultures it becomes a problem that because the Geography is different,so is Pokemon and so the trainers are a bit different,bit varied,bit diversed(Delia and Misty laughs),but i've been everywhere,i've never seen a 22 year old kid being able to handle a..um.. whatever Gyarados(Misty laughs shaking her head) to the extent where she made it like Mime is to you mom,at the age of 22 and that too
withing 6 or 7 months after she alone had to tame it,cause some godf..umm..she tamed it like you've with Mime in 19 years and she tamed it to this level in 4 months and on 6th month attained a legendary status(Misty shakes her head and trying to stop Ash,Delia smiles),no i won't stop till i show the once only that you are(Misty laughs and shakes her head)..barring Unova she’s THE best in water pokemon trainging as gym leader cause i’ve been to 1250 gyms including Cerulian(all laugh) and Unova thinks i’m from mars(all laugh) Mist will become best gym leader in water poekmons or just leave it ANY POKEMONS(frowns,Misty laughs shaking her head,Delia smiles) just let her unleash my bunch and the world will see what a dragon can do and Mist’s Gyarados’s current form is a dragon but the day i first saw her Gyarados during our reunion at Hoenn that day Mist was Ah,just her whole presence deluged me in... (Misty blushes after smirking at
Ash,Delia smiles)the spontenous thought of Mist!Mist!you’re so sweetie!(burst into laughter,Misty blushes and then shakes her head Ash smirks at her,Delia laughs) and with mainly her Gyarados andabsoluty single handedly turned a god..um..not so reputed Gym of Cerulian to a legendary gym with a elusive sort of name like Viridian(Misty smiles and Delia pats Misty) the forsaken Cerulian
vultures(Delia and Misty frowns)..no i'll say how they don't want to give my flower the crown that is only her's cause they’re too egotistical to imagine it..(Delia smiles and pats a blushing Misty)..those Cerulian buffoons who yesterday had the audacity to imply to me that i've deceitfully abducted Their flower,but the thing is that she's MY FLOWER(Misty turns her head down blushing,Delia smiles and hugs her)(smile) and the touble was that they would rather clap her to
death than to help her to stand and then they.."
Delia(sigh) : "Ash, it's about Mist,not your vultures.."
(Misty shakes her head)
Ash(smile) : "right,my eternally sweet Mist flower(Misty laughs shaking her head and Delia too laughs) can push her Gyarados now to a level which she told you about and then this Gyarados isn't her strongest Pokemon at all,it is her Golduck and Dewgong and Jellicent and Sharpedo and Kyogre and Manaphy and Tapu Fini and Kaledo (Misty laughs and shakes her head)and Carracosta and Tentacruel and Starmie and so on,she had Starmie at like 11 year birthday present.."
Misty(smile) : "10"
Ash(smile) : "right,10 year present,and there are many more,she is an once ever talent in anticipation and thus grows in confidence with each passing moment of the match and that mind game which she does unknowingly is enough to kill off many great challengers including me SURELY(all laugh)so the vultures finally were about to budge as they would've abjectly humiliated themselvs otherwise but the hallowed Cerulian City for the love of God never bothered,they wanted more and more and everyday every hour there would be this damn arrogant brat who'd challenge only to show(Delia frowns and Misty laughs) that the brat was an once ever utter failure as a celebrated boy scout or shought after girl cheerleader(Delia scowls and Misty frowns)..no let me continue..(both shakes their heads)..but my flower still had to appease those brats by giving them a badge and fighting them which obviously didn’t last even a second as they used Metapod against Gyarados(both Misty and Delia laughs)..which(beaming) i myself did infact(all laughs),anyway still out of her generosity my flower gave them a badge as she did to me otherwise i would’nt have been able to continue my career(Misty laughs shaking her head and Delia too laughs) and this badge they
got will be the only ever in their god damn lives and thus my flower was getting drained more and
more mentally and physically and all that the all caring idiotic Cerulian might was doing was to
cheer her slow death."
Delia(solemn) : "Mist,i heard about your success to an extenet and also that you weren't well,but
this really was too much.."
Misty(smile) : "mom,you know he's just exaggerating,i'm fine now,and no had he been there at this form of his(laugh)(Delia laughs)...i wouldn't have needed to work or perform at all,money would've poured into the Gym simply by this rate of trash talking even with wife and mother in this language(Delia shakes head,Ash laughs),long live the vultures Ash,really"
(Misty and Delia bursts into laughter)
Ash(smile) : "good break,thanks for the refreshments Mist and especially sweet for me(Misty shakes her head),and this will be long"
(Misty and Delia again bursts into laughter)
Ash(smile) : "then there was the king of brats is the neighbouring Frontier Symbol.this brat conspiring with our well known Cerulian all-knowers, tried to defame my little flower there but then as i've told you,my flower is more than strong enough to topple any goddamn weed pretending to be trees,and so this frontier Symbol had to be put over upon my sweet sweetflower,which she barely was able to manage as it's like two gyms in one building and you can understand the workload that my flower had to bear alone and then the Cerulian brats quadrupled with this double gym system(both laughs)and finally these idiots came with a new plan,they were sending...(solemn)..Mist this will become personal"
Misty(grim) : "Ash, just give it a break,would you?"
Delia(concerned) : "what did they do to my little doll Ash?"
Ash(solemn) : "Mist, you're seeing my moods but mom needs to know,though she doesn’t believe it but still she must’ve heard it the umpteenth time and therefore about us and especially you she has an idea.."
Delia(scoff) : "Ash,are you.."
Misty(sigh) : "not again,Ash,i'm not going to listen”
(hugs Delia)"
Ash(solemn) : "Mom,you've taught me to be honest with myself first,you want to see that
today?"
Delia(frown) : "i understand,yes,Mime,don't allow anyone in at any cost no matter who,Mist,dear
you're too tired go to my room and have a nap..you too Pikachu just protect the house but don't go
overboard(Mime and Pikachu leaves)Mist..no it’s ok honey your're too tired..”
Ash(smile) : “Mom,just a minute,please..hold on..Mist,just a sec sweetie,won’t you be able to bear with me?”
Misty(sigh) : “um..no it’s ok mom,i’m alright.and Ash don’t go overboard.”
Delia(sternly) : “Ash don’t..”
Ash(smile) : “please mom,just bear with me,she’ll be more than fine,yes Mist you can put your head down on the table or lie there in the sofa,just make sure you hear our conversation clearly and cogitate as we did yesterday.”
Misty(puts her head down) : “make it bearable”
Delia(frown) : “i see,(hugs Misty)..it’s ok Mist you’re with you mom(Misty hugs Delia)..”
Misty(dejected) : “tell him not to repeat it again mom,whole night this is relaying with my sisters and all.”
Delia(frowns at Ash,tendering Misty) : “Ash,you heard her and i’m telling you not to cross any limits as well..”
Ash(solemn) : “that’s done mom.”
Delia(frown) : "Mist is my child just like you and has been for 16 years in my mind no matter what
and you know the best that i don't have any reservations about her,but if you're so bent on
proving your points to anyone,then say,but as Mist and i also said,this is the very last
time you'll ever repeat this"
Ash(solemn) : "MOM,i got you.it’s done as you say,mom.right,Mom you know about Kalos incident and you also know i was kissed or(disdainfully) rather spat at from blank full of cough(Delia frowns) accidentally in public,and many times these stunts were performed on me during undercover cause they could’nt beat my bunch so beat me in emotional vulgar games at which they never succeeded(frown,Delia sighs and shakes her head)..and these were accidents and before them there was one kiss and that was the first for us both- me and my Mist-that was the first time i did that on my own wish as her wish also matched mine on that day and our wish matched a few times more after that till we broke-up then and these had nothing to do with psychophysical ideas(frown).Mist has ever cherished me almost from the first sight as have I and you know all of it,but..this is funny and please bear with me..then the vultures started to peek around me especially after the Sinnoh Miracle,as you know and no i didn't cheat on her but my ego that i’m honest thus everything is taken for granted and i can not care thus about people sucking who i’ve reached my level and no my bunchh is the reason but only i don’t look after my bunch there’s the whole lab and then Brock and all and mostly my Mist without whom it makes no sense to me of anything but that ego of being honest with myself swelled a bit too much and eventually we separated,the real fun starts now,so the Cerulian brats came up with a particular plan that now since my flower depressed and alone,these would circulate over and you know mom,the irony is that i wasn't there at all,i was in heaven,well according to the vultures,anyhow,both she was mentally tortured beyond measures by the vultures and they were circling around me as well but while i could travel around she was confined to her gym and show which is a golden cage with the responsibility to poslish it every damn day so that more damn brats may get in in the name of Gym battling and thus vultures got a way bigger grip on her than they ever could has or will get over me cause this language,so then you know we broke up and we took the same measure in different froms,she continued to withdraw herself,i continued to attack them..the only thing was that i was moving around so i in a way was in much more favourable condition,which um well...helped me to anticipate if anybody wanted to fall for me which she was NOT DOING,and to cut the long story short,you're seeing that except
for my flower none did bear with me through THE hell and you know exactly what hell i'm talking
about(Delia frowns,solemn)..she has been hearing me spit this out to whoever that dared to
challenge me and my flower yesterday(Delia frowns)-no it was Brock,Lillie and Daisy,all family-
got thrown at some choised logic mercilessly by me,but it hurts her,no only Daisy,Tracey,Brock and Lillie got this, they're all family,so it's not that the vultures can do anything about or with it...it's just to keep you informed what did happen-yesterday i insulted Mist like i could never dream myself and did that again and again and again and again she came back with the hope that we can reconcile.Mom,i've seen may b...um,sorry,people but her devotion to me for absolutely no reason since the age of 15 when she first had a gimplse of me till now for 19 years constant for which she was on the verge of total destruction,this devotion made me submit to her and she will go through any hell for me because of absolutely nothing,i didn't speak with her very gently,i haven't done anything good to her in 18 years,i broke-up and went away leaving her to get tortuted beyond measures by all and still she for some reason won't ever leave me no matter who i was and
where i'm in whatever conditions may it be she come back to me just for no reason except that she cherishes me since that very first meeting when both of us were 15 and since that very first sight all she knows about me is- ‘my Ash’-just as you know and that’s why we are where we are(Delia smiles).and that's exactly what she was ever even after our breakup,when the Cerulian brats were
hovering around and after sometimes Mist just couldn't take anymore of it and shut herself up in her
room and only attending to pokemon and overworking to the ultimate all the while burning inside just for no reason except that i never came back after i broke up and it turned into a severe depression much to the joy of those brats and my sweet flower was dying a slow and miserable death all because she was hoping i'll come back even if for only a moment someday,and finally i returned but yet tortured her yesterday to every hell including that one and as many more i could imagine but she refused to let go off me but as soon as i smiled and put a gentle hand over her shoulder you can see the overnight change in her and this all she did while she herself is a legend in Hall of Fame of water pokemon gyms and infinitely many true great men would die to be her but she was only ever going to be mine cause she can’t be she if not me(smiles at Misty,Delia too smiles at Misty and keeps tendering her,Misty still sitting with her hed down on the table).i've not ever been kind to her except leaving her high and dry when i thought 25 days wasn’t enough to marry her officially registering and then go to Unova atleast then all these 7 damn years she would’nt have suffered but anyway no matter what she is stubbornly following me ever since she first saw me and would do so no matter what as i told you just like you i’ve been all her since first sight..she has listened to what i’ve just told you throughout the night and yesterday also for the umpteenth time and yet she still agreed to go through that once again just now after going completely sleepless last night hearing this same being repeated again and again,the reason is because i told her to bear with me and i told her i don't hide anything from my mom,so she's bearing it now and will so too if i tell the same to the vultures no matter the consequences and no matter how many times she will do the same because i’m just her ‘my Ash’ and there's no other reason at all.i stopped her going as you were taking her away to your room just to give you the first hand experience of Mist is all about to clarify all 6 years once more.so if you ever heard anything that the vultures told through their lackey the media about me believe all of it as being far less than what i was actually being,but as far as your daughter goes,you can as well treat it no matter what and how serious it is as a mere dust particle on the most precious once only jewel.i won’t tell you whether i reciprocate my flower’s feelings for me or not or whether i truely were sitting or attracting attention with the hope that i can get whoever i want,and thus the all conquering Cerulian brats and their master the vultures has once again just abjectly failed in another of their great endeavours.but they'll be at it again but the only thing is that next time i'll be more prepared too,anyhow, that's the story"
Delia(tendering Misty's head) : "good enough Ash,but this is the last time you said this and if it's
not then.."
Misty(raising her head from the table,sigh) : "mom, that's Ash's power i was talking about(a bit shivering voice)am i wrong Ash?"
Ash(smile) : "no,you're not Mist!you’re not" 
Delia(tendering Misty) : "ok let's leave and let him entertain his vultures all he wants"
Ash(laugh) : "mom,please i'll leave ,only if I can hug my flower um..the umpteenth time..”
Delia(tendering Misty,frown) : "do it more than that,but.."
Ash(laugh) : "my power is that i'll trash talk people and tell them such bare truths that the honesty of me if present will connect with them and their pokemons if pokemons are involved,and then if i want i can extract any secret i want and in the battle it'll mean if you had Mimey and i came without any pokemons,5 such Mimes won't cop with me cause they'll want to play with me all the time and be my pokemon rather so what to speak if i have 107 best trained pokemons myself? Thus we don’t battle cause that word makes no sense to us and thus i can make people tell the absolute truth cause i had to face it from close stare and this'll be if able to help you,you good,if not my bad.yes,the Mimes won’t include your Mimey cause she is included in 107 in a very special place(Delis smiles and shakes her head)...no she can tame a Mewtwo in her dream without battling and making friends with him as much as you will yourself have a Mewtwo as your child but the condition is you can’t intrude in Mime’s process while she is taming and worry about her then she will think about you and won’t be able to do what i said she can so in such cases just let her do whatever she wants and stay at a distance without any worries as much as you can cause she can tame a whole herd of much higher legends than Mewtwo just as well as anyone else of my buddies can.Mist,you yourself or anyone else has the same powers but your temperaments are very different so may be you can never do what i'm upto,but your bunch will be able to do what my bunch does but in a different way and if two such pokemons meet there’s only friendship and you understand who their trainers would be if their bunch can do that so they won’t be Team Rocket 1 vs Team Roket 2.but those who think water pokemon trainers cant handle electeic types they may test Pikachu with Mist and that'll be their last sane day here..anyhow..i know many more things as you know what i said isn’t acheived overnight or suddenly though that key moment is ever sudden but as a result only yet when it’s there none would remember the path to that cause the joy of being there will erase the joy during the path but also my only weapon is that and you already know it as do Pikachu,Mime and so on,i took my flower through it,and my flower follows me no matter what i do to her so i had to pick her up from the forsaken Cerulian City's damn Gym and now has put here at my home which should’ve been officially done 16 years back.this is where i live and my flower now is my family. My sweet wife MISTY KETCHUM.the end."
Delia(smile) : "i get you,but your process is only good for your vultures,and yes you may hug Mist now"
Ash(smile) : "right.(hugging Misty very firmly) there there Mist,you want to hear the flower song again no which was mine not Cerulian"
Misty(blush,hugging Ash quickly) : "later"
Ash(laughing,hugging Misty more firmly) : “mom can i fondle my sweet wife now(burst into laughter,Misty laughs)”
Delia(laugh,going away) : “have a nice day”
Ash(smile,hugging Misty firmly) : “right,this i’ve wanted to do for 19 years..my sweet sweet Mist..”
Misty(laugh) : “Ash..”
Ash(same pose,picks Misty up) : “attitude?(both burst into laughter)...in front of mom(both burst into laughter again,puts Misty down)...no first you keep hugging me otherwise i’ll take you to kitchen(both laugh,Misty hugs Ash firmly and smiles)...my sweet Mist...(they keep hugging each other for a few moments then sits down on the couch,Ash hugs Misty and she rests herslf on Ash)...want to know whole 107(both burst into laughter)...ok,lets call mom too(laugh,Misty laughs and shakes her head)...”
(few Minutes later,Delia now present)
Delia(irritated) : “Ash,what is this..”
Ash(hugging Delia) : “mommy,don’t you want to know your little baby’s bunch in details?”
Delia(hugging Ash and kissing his forehead) : “go on,too happy today(all laugh)”
Ash(sitting beside Misty) : “right then flower’s water bunch(burst into laughter,Delia and Misty laugh and shake their heads)...all food today will automatically REACH,cause surely you do know that i’m just RICH(all laugh)..right,so we start,
mom i’m just mentioning their types though that itself can be catergorized in 10000 parts may be(laugh,Misty laughs and shakes her head,Delia laugh)...anyway,
1.my sweet Chu bro(all smile,Ash kisses and tenders Pikachu who reciprocates then goes to the others in rounds)...starter,electric type...just my bro ever always(all smile),male..starves to prolong a battle to make that moment like the end of a date most ENJOYING(both burst into laughter,Delia laughs shaking her head)..almost spoilt but too infatuated with me so kept a veil to protect me unnecessarily(all laugh) but when the opponent is more in number or too powerful uses this line exactly(all laugh)..utter brat this is(all laugh)..but now lets begin the DARK KNIGHTS(all burst into laughter,Delia shakes her head),(calls Gengar and Sableye without words)
2.GENGAR(burst into laughter,others laugh and shake their heads,Gengar tickles and licks everyone then goes away to play with others-Sableye,Greninja and Pikachu,Sableye too joined Gengar and Pikachu irritated all three and laugh,few minutes later),anything else(all laugh),ghost-poison..well Gengar has a comrade at arms in Sableye(all laugh)..who is more dangerous cause he teaches all how to be him and Gengar at the same time as he was trying to(all laugh)..he’s just like Genagar just a bit different,Gengar’s motto of a perfect Gengar life is just 2 lines and absolutely nothing else it is best put as Gary so beautifully says is that Gengar has only this in his mind whole time,’what is this Gengar if full of care/we have no time to tickle and fare(all burst into laughter)...no more(all laugh)..,came from the next generation of my Haunter whom Sabrina has as you know,Hall of Fame gym leader at Safforn psychic and ghost types a legendary name really without whoose knowledge and constant support i would never have been a pokemon master cause i never would’ve learnt about psychic types and she ever been too generous and warm to both me and Mist(all smile)..her attitude of ever being a big sister to me and her is all cause her father was a famous psychic pokemon trainer and mom was out of profession,her dad was Luther Arnold and he was a huge name in Safforn as you know one of the most famous places for psychic types.then the gym went to committee and Mr Arnold got that when Sabrina was 12 then she was 15 and travelled Kanto,Johto customery gym leader travel till 18 then from 18-20 she was so attuned to psychic types and her own personality being very introverted frombeginning a hunger for more psychic power and control over other people and like hypnotism,Telekeneis,holding sway over other people despite their physical presence being far off but within a distance and so on then this is only helped by pokemons they don’t understand your motives they do what they do you try to connect to them and then they give you something and through them you do something but these makes the concerned person go totally insane after one point cause there’s acentral reason behind these practises pwoer hunger or so on that reason is to be satisfied thus the activities and with each success it will occur that this is highest but it’s not so it will be increasing the hunger thus all thoughts of sanity will go only this will remain eventually all powers are lost once there’s no sanity thus those can’t be taken by nerves will forget all processes and all and the subject become total lunatic and yeah i know all these too well along with my bunch but(laugh) all these are child’s play to me and my bunch to where roam around mom there’s negetive danger we can fool around with danger cause we don’t bother about about person too happy with ourselves thus that overflows to the others making them love us if they so want and our nature don’t change we’re as we are just the joviality increases if given a chance thus we have a great bond with people if they give us a chance and that is real psychic power not being a power at all cause all has it so there’s no point being serious and you all are no different to me thus the huge family and thus no psychic powers are nay good to us nor can they harm us at all cause we have no intention but to be happy ourselves(smile,others smile) and anyway this exact phenomena was needed to cure Sabrina and then she became a gym leader at 20 picked up a creepy reputation and when we met was 24 extremely good gym leader but challengers were scared to death cause she gave a picture of horror in their mind was ok from 20-22/23 but the last year was serious issue and when we went there she was on the verge of real psychological trouble the gym having been red flagged for about 4 months and so on her parents were psychologically disturbed as well and then i got Haunter and went on challenged her Haunter got her to smile after like 7 years and she was cured and picked up hall of fame tag Haunter remained with her Gengar is her son but she never evolved beyond a Haunter this Gengar i had along with my other ghosts for 3 days at Safforn forest(laugh) anyway,Sabrina got Hall of fame Tag with 14 years when she was 39 me 30 but it was delayed all cause of her activities she was worthy of it when she was 26 and thus i’ve ever had contacts with her so has Mist and since that day to now same attitude it’s been 19 years and so on but all i got to know and the rest of the world if surveyed properly there’s no other way to be but to be happy with a Gengar and then a Sableye(all laugh) GENGAR(all laugh,Gengar,Sableye and Chu zaps in and pesters them then again goes away,all laugh)..that is what it is called by psychic channels alway at service zapped in here(all laugh) this is the pinnacle of psyhic power(burst into laughter,others laugh shaking their heads) what is this Gengleye if full of care/we can’t tickle around cause you won’t fare(all laugh) anyway,i’m just naming them as they come and Gengar i always consider from Kanto(1)..male..and there’s another someone in Safforn who is an amusing trainer of an Alakazam(burst into laughter,Misty frowns at Ash then laughs,Ash quickly hugs her)...i lost my semi final match in Johto Championships to a Melody Sanders from Safforn as you know mom she is this someone(laugh,Misty too laughs)...i confessed to Mist about my feeling to her after Hoenn but it would’ve been done just after the end of Johto had she stayed for another week even if here which was my wish(laugh,Misty laughs and shakes her head,Delia too laughs) in that finals you know i told you many times how without Mist and Brock i would’ve went out in the 32 round itself cause the opponent Blanc Norris was then a 4 times champion at the age of 30 to my 20 and now in Hall of fame just like me(laugh) and that was actually most about Mist cause Brock as ever was Brock but Mist and me was just so happy being together then and that relected in my performances but thus also during the finals we both were too overprotective of each other and i never let Mist to talk with anyone unless me or Brock was just beside her(all laugh) and if any girl talked with me for more than 2 minutes Mist was extremely angry(laugh,Misty and Delia laughs) and this girl having beaten me and was so good won that title then next match spoke for 15 after huggingg me(all laugh) and thus she was a sworn-in enemy to my sweetie(all laugh) and still is(laugh,hugs Misty quickly,Misty frowns at Ash then laughs,Delia frowns and then laughs),but i spoke with her the most(all laugh) afterwards and Mist never knew of course(all laugh) untill i confessed to her(all laugh,Misty laughs shaking her head) Melody went to the after match party where Mist wasn’t allowed cause of rules(all laugh) but before that i did Mist’s ponytail first time(all laugh) and then hugged her for one hour(all laugh) and our discussion was that she asked me as we were looking at each other like in dream that why do boys look at girls(all burst into laughter) and my answer was don’t know a mystry(all laugh) never had the meaningful words cause that disturbed the peace between us in that situation cause you know why out of blue a 18 year old teenager so nonchalantly calls you mom after 3 days of familiarity and stay(all laugh) and then scoffs at me in front of you taking your side all times(all laugh) but then if you don’t understand something about training and all tells you how good my victory was but never in front of me and referred to me as my Ash(all laugh) and i held her hands without any hesitation or the thought of it in front of you(all laugh) and joked with her and whispered to her all time(all laugh) Mist and me have been wife and husband since day 0(all laugh) so never bothered about words ever but then after this i go to that party and Melody comes up and again hugs me first up(all laugh) i realized then that it’s just that age(all laugh) but that wasn’t the case i soon understood as she then spoke for full one hour with me and had our dinner there and all i realized that what an once ever talent she is in psychic pokemons and yeah i and she both were at the end of our 3rd region only so little did we realize the professional depth that we had and i was a one time champ she three but she herself was so well known on psychic types then and almost all of her bunch was psychic not all pure but had psychics and wanted to talk about them whole life plus next(all laugh) three months older to me started exactly 3 months before me,finished Kanto as champ 2 months before me,went to Orange,finished 1 month before me and then Johto we went at the same time but never met in competitions at Johto met in Kanto once infact a psychic cup where fshe did beat me but then i was just about 16(both laugh) i only had Pangoro,Meowstic and Whimsicott and my first ever psychic cup 2nd for her(both laugh) so it was just a normal chat and that was 3rd round only she herself lost the next(both laugh) but she used to say after that loss her talents really opened up and she never lost anoth psychic cup EXCEPT again to me at Orange with MARSHADOW(all laugh) that was semi finals again(both laugh) then she was hurt in prestige(all laugh) but that made her more concentrated so she won the league(all laugh) this too she used to say that twice before never talked or bothered to talk much(all laugh) but then met at Johto strangely despite starting at same month and in Johto despite doing all those many gyms and competitions never and straight in semis and both of us heard about each other and in Johto me and she was the surprize package my Muk having Muked a Dragonite(all laugh) and she astonishingly at that age with such a jovial and frank character won 2 in 2 from start with psychic of all types her starter is Fennekin a fire-psychic evolved last form Delphox and then she had very few pokemons but all had to be psychic(all laugh) almost all except the water types(all laugh) went to Kanto with 20,Orange,25,Johto 33 and most were psychic or dark and then she was found at all psychic competitons(all laugh) and so on then that is for professional part and i realized a very sweet girl who is extremely frank to an extent that she was hugging me a random stranger like as if knows me for ages and was talking about all sorts of psychic stuffs and all i reciprocated to much and you know my approach to girls specially if they ask personal questions(all laugh) except my wife(all laugh) so as usual i spoke all the formalities and all asked me about Mist but very politely just asked your travel companion or girlfriend(all laugh) i said no travel companion for 5 long years since day 1 just one of my best friends very nice girl(all laugh) we are just very good friends(all laugh) this meant i implied that i was well to use the bugged word BOOKED(burst into laughter,Misty blushes and frowns at Ash shaking her head,Ash quickly hugs her and then she laughs,Delia laughs) fire contest,Johto,Massie was the name of that girl,semi final before that Bayleaf saved one of her pokemons from some calamity caused by the great Team Rocket(all laugh) then she goes,’ah!i’ve always liked these kind of bravehearted men,are you free tonight we need to discuss our future(all laugh)’,’excuse me but he’s BOOKED(burst into laughter,Misty shakes her head while laughig,Delia laughs),’says who(all laugh)?’,’I,MIS-TY(all laugh)’,’oh!MIS-TY are you his girlfriend(all laugh)’,’um..no..um..i’m his coach(burst into laughter,Delia laughs,Misty shakes her head laughing)’...sweet bug(quickly hugs Misty who laughs,Delia too laughs)..so then during end Johto i was sure that Mist will come here and i’ll propose to her IN MY ROOM(all laugh) cause it’s so good to say ‘mom!mom! Mist is girlfriend-wife’(laughs,Misty laughs shaking her head and Delia also laughs) but then there was DaisyDevil(laugh,Misty burst laughter,Delia too laughs),so the Daisyl says(all laugh),’Mist return within two days we’re going out the day next to tomorrow for world tour with the show,if you don’t come the gym will be shut for 8 months(all laugh)..’ and the reason why Daisy of all devils(laughs,others laugh as well) was so hellbent on leaving the whole gym upon her baby sis who was to all of them so sweet that they at that age(laugh,others laugh as well) never knew how to express that(all laugh) so was expressed in quarrels(all laugh) anyway,Daisy flower finds that dumb jackal(Misty burst into laughter,Delia frowns) means TraceyDevil(burst into laughter both,Delia laughs) so Trace was entrusted upon cause from 1st day Trace was looking for second cousin mask(all laugh) as a fox(both burst into laughter,Delia laughs shaking her head) and Daisy found her soulmate who she could sentimentally chide to express her longing for him(all laugh) so Mist was there anyway,so Melody was told that and then i realized that she never had any ulterior motives towards me(all laugh) just joked that she may not think so(all laugh) just had a joke then i told her that Mist was a gym leader and all she was happy then asked me of my next regional tour and i said either Hoenn or Battle Frontier after going back have to decide she said i see good idea but i will decide only after final and that was it cause she had a final three days later and in between stll spoke with me behind my Mist flower’s back(all laugh) cause my Mist flower was most Gyaradosey then(all laugh) anyway then i go to Hoenn she goes to Kalos ever had professional contacts Kalos that talent got totally wasted it’s just the general culture there mom the authorities can’t change it one has to be very firm and witfull there are great people and pokemons and all but not so easy to find them cause even them being from Kanto it may seem too frivolus but they’re not it’s just the cultural difference but anyway,she got some chosen travel companions and all 2 years and 5 months she was there,but there she went still upto round 4 lost badly then while she was there i won Hoenn and then was at battle frontier and we were same in level at Johto but Hoenn to be honest with you mom except Mist none could’ve beaten me and Mist had to be a pokemon trainer like me and still had to have particular pokemons and the orders right that day my 3rd and 4th trophy i felt invinsible and also in Orange the first,Hoenn just that i know that Mist might’ve beaten me but still it was on my favour 65-35 and mind the last number(laugh,Misty and Delia laughs) yeah only if that was there could she have beaten me if a stranger no chance(all laugh) but then i went to Unova(all laugh) since then to be honest it’s just like a yawn to my bunch to smoke off any kind of challenge and no they could’ve been beaten by legendary pokemons but only them at Unova but we went to Kalos and that was outworldly stuff(all laugh) if mom ever is challenged to battle against any with the most elusive legends just send Mime and don’t bother about her the legend will himself protect from all humans(laugh,others smile) but you should never be bothered about Mime if you do then she can’t cause your thought will bug her but if she’s left alone nothing can stop her from befriending them and that’s my whole secret as my bunch told me we don’t want to battle at all(all smile) anyway back to Melody then she always told me at Kalos can’t concentrate i ever said just focus on your bunch and forget the rest or try to the rest will be fine but she required more assistance and all i’ve ever been known as emotionless hardcore professional and it was true cause my nature is like that i don’t want to mingle with people infact Mist herself devoured me first day(all laugh) and so on and generally i’m nice and friendly and professionally helpful to them cause i don’t hide much except which can’t be said cause it’s about the bunch not me in both cases and so on then Melody returned and went to Unova where she struggled for 3 years to even get to the finals lost in first round within 20 minutes and then returend to Safforn her hometwo was special psychic pokemon trainer there but more of a help to all professionals  and i ever had that professional contact cause she is astonishingly good with psychic types cause of her intuition and sudden counters exactly like my style and thus was extremely helpful to me and to whole world all wanted to contact her along with Sabrina there Melody as a duo was famous and she ever foisted her personal life in brief upon me despite not knowing anything in return i spoke about 58 minutes per month with her for 9 long years(laugh) ever a bot less than 10 minutes average in call(laugh) and out of that 12 minutes were reserved for her whole life and my little bits and thus i knew everything about her she nothing except my professional achievements and during Unova with all those public stunts going on she never bothered cause she saw that for 6 years in Kalos and Unova to an extent that killed her general training career off and then i broke-up with Mist here and you know i was at Safforn and then one day met her and we saw each other may be after 3 years only once or twice did she video call in 9 years and that had to be behind Brock as well(laugh) Mist knew about those only i told her everything about everything after confessing and Mist herself was bemused by Melody’s career cause 3 in 3 from first with that kind of way then go off very strange and anyway,then we all thought just in Safforn she has found the right way of living so i in that meeting was there spoke for 50 minutes and then she suddenly asks about Misty cause then Misty was such a elusive name with the show and all i said no i don’t know anything about her for 8 years(all laugh) i only know about my Mist who ever is so unhappy if i call her Misty(all laugh) so anyway,then suddenly she says did you break up with her i said what are you talking about it’s been 9 long years says no i remember that and wanted to know about my personal life i said no i’m a professional as much as she knows me to be in all sections of life then she broke down totally saying how to be a professional like you i was thinking of ulterior again(laugh) but anyway then i said look you were so happy to talk about professional things why move away from that she to herself says no you’ve recently broken up thus saying and then just says like how could he do that with that girl and i realized thing are out of control her beau cheated on her(laugh) sorry for language but far worse will come cause i want to tell you i’ve been so cruel to Melody ever cause yesterday night things went on that will get people to praise me to heaven thus this anyway,then no not my family but via them many will come around anyway,so i say look we know each other for 9 years but only professionally why are you sharing pungent moments of your personal life to a random stranger that you’ve seen may be 4 times in 9 years and face to face this is the first in 9 she became very serious said no even personal good friends have left me and all you with very few others have remained so professional to me despite my life and you never once bothered about it but your professional help has been invaluable to me and so on said no i don’t want to break the professionality by forcing you but you have become more than that to me as the best teammate that doesn’t bother about personal life and will walk alongside anywhere due to profession and you will only remember me for a match 9 years ago and my skills but now you’re somewhere that in once in centuries but still you’ve remained the same than says what happened the Kalos wisdom if wrongly presented what happens and now i myslef bear witness to that anyway,came back from Unova all dejected such talents don’t get lost quickly regrouped and reached fame Knato-Johto wide and then that frank too sweet too open nature and frivolity that was not frivolity acually that was the general nature but that frivolity was perfectly fuelled in Kalos and then became the base of a triangle and one of the sides proposed to her then just about when it was time to get into married life ofcourse backtracked cause he needed that fame to get to another who was the target number one then this was a family wide issue she never saw her mom and her dad was pretty old single child and uncles and all were there never happy with her nature and all then the 2nd part was the other side of the triangle who now jumped upon her cause of age related issues then both Melody and that brat was in that wavelength went off grid then got to the specific professionals to rinse of that mistake that was a concrete proof of illegal relations exactly to prevent what there’s a thing called marriage anyway,so then that 2nd side found another with whom he did the same but the thing was that that was his right choise and the other way around as well cause again it was just about fame and honest mistake confession so now Melody was left in that situation and told me about it i was aghast and it was about 3 weeks after my own break-up so you can understand my position and Mist and me wasn’t talking with each other for 3/4 months before Unova finals and she was a huge star and was i anyway,then i consoled her saying look you can’t stay there forever you have to look up and forward atleast your bunch won’t break your trust that is assured and then she was happy said exactly why she needed professional help like this to look ahead and so on and then i never asked about her to anyone then except Sabrina who said may be she has too much respect for you thus answered your call and spoke for such a long time with open heart cause it’s been 2 months since she has been sane even doesn’t want to talk with anyone and all then i just told Sabrina that i just said be professional that’s our life in reality and all Sabrina said yeah she has to be and that was it then i go under the cover and my contacts are covered and then again come out cause of Crawdauntogator led bunch of mine many could do what they did that day if not all cause all weren’t that spoiled then as those two came way before Sableye was as spoiled but he being a ghost didn’t want to use him anyway,then Melody did have contacts with me afterwards was very professional never one word like before about her personal life but those 12 minutes became philosophical natured talk and that was in between line stuff for life personal yet is as useful in profession cause for psychic handingling you need to stay grounded and without any ego and Melody never once had the thirst of psychic powers despite her situations show in heart how simple nice and yet firm she is and thenshe informed me was going out of profession was to get married and husband is a double Kanto winner main league and Frontier,John Harrison and last i heard from her more than a year back during my Kalos finals told just is in Levender moved there and was fine with it so i’m also very happy that the end has been happy but that is what matters and i just told you all these cause of flow and this is necessary cause i’ve not been kind to her no matter what she thinks and the reason for that is same that made me deluded that Mist was Misty and thus not mine(laugh,others smile) but it was ok then last time i was at Levender gym i asked about her to the gym leader said no  out of profession but happy life so i was happy and didn’t want to contact cause i to her remain as professional utmost if she thinks that is good for her let it be like that and don’t disturb her unless she calls and my contact is universal via any damn Elite4(laugh,all smile)..anyway,with Mist flower as gym leader whole world can contact me by Video but that will be a bug gym(laughs,quickly hugs Misty who smiles,Delia too smiles)...so with my real cunning nature being shown lets begin the DARKNESS(laugh,else laughs and shake their heads)..well none of my brats want them to be called by their full chosen names cause that’s serious to them(all

none from Orange,Sinnoh,Unova and Kalos can and none from Frontier either and only 2 from Johto,1 from Hoenn,2 from Kanto just that and my current Butterfree gave up that power which for bug types is

all hells(all laugh)..this is cynicism at highest(all laugh)..and the reason they flew off was cause these brats can manipulate what they will show and what they won’t no matter what they are told to do and if they pester them too much they will try to connect to them directly in the general way that they can and why they are pokemons and thus they can send them to utmost vulgar planes which they know only and hence they will get mad(aboth laugh,Delia shakes her head laughing) and if a Butterfree can do that imagine what will happen if Mime is pestered(all laugh)..and you know mom all these pests with their intelligence none in this world can keep for 19 years cause Muk is spoiled from day 0(all laugh) and you know how Professor has kept him and he’s now 84 and Muk’s been with him since he was 65 and at this age even still tolerates that brat(all laugh) and all cause of Muk’s nature and Muk loves him more than me and my bunch has been so unique take Mime for example and then came Feraligator(all laugh) and Tyranitar and so on nowhere in the world they would’ve got what they get here and Tracey and Gary are unique gems in their fields and you know mom they give numbers against my name i do 1%,50% is my bunch,49% is all in the lab and Trace,Gary and Professor of course is the main and as much is Daisy and Lillie cause their care have given these pests a new lease of life due to the security they feel and close monitoring and still you know my 1% and the rest 49% is also in equal amount all about Brock without who me and Mist as well would’ve been still lost in our first journey itself(both laugh,Delia smiles) he is and has been what he is and Violet helped me with my Mantine so much cause she knows more than them about them(all laugh) and thus these 6 my family are as much once in a millenia alongside my bunch cause none can work with my bunch like they can and they are so happy just for their love of pokemons and as much as my bunch has given me the name and all this whole lab has given the same to my bunch and you know mom during the last 4 years i wasn’t kind to anyone there and my bunch has received only better and better care and never anything else yes they wanted them for their pupose as well cause they helped in so many unique results that this lab has produced,yes i can still say they were after my money cause i was directing everything here to facilitate them and pay them 2 times the normal fees,yes i can say by default they held a burgain against me cause my mom is here and virtually they have to look after her but all this is never possible unless i really am same to Gary is to Professor and Trace and Gary consideres me as more than their very own brother so they could give my bunch that care and without this relation none else would no matter their own necessities and infact Daisy and Lillie the same no matter their resentments over me till yesterday my bunch was looked after like their own and thus is my bunch what they are so without this lab no my bunch would’ve been nowhere near this level or any level for that matter so they too are as much family to me but not because of my bunch but because of nothing cause they atleast Gary and Professor were there since i was 0 and Brock i ever say and Violet too so all didn’t come to me cause of my bunch or me just like Mist i’ve ever been my Ash to them just as siblings do have(all smile)..and this is all of my life personal and professional and i have Mist and my family and still my sis and her whole family my friends,travel companions all of it makes that number i only get the attention that’s all and Mist the same though gym leader life is much more difficult in a way that you have to do so much more all by yourself and the personal life is so hard here to have and she still is a star in a different profession simultaneously but you know the spotlight should be over me as i said i’m too cunning and well rounded after all my experiences to protect my dear ones and let them have their most enjoyable life away from public eye atleast cause you see i’ve become eloquent(all laugh) and Buzzwole is male and called wither that or Buzzy or

well in Unova whatever happened during that time with Tyranitar and Madgaleo(all laugh) i got 19 in total 15 dragons 4 ghosts(all laugh)..and with this ends my bunch(laugh,Delia laughs,Misty too laughs)..
well,after Kanto my very first region the pokemons i was so lucky that they chose me were enough to get upto semifinals atleast so i give you that bunch and i wasn’t prepared yet so they didn’t in Orange they won in Johto we were not good enough that day on semi finals anyway so after Kanto with my starter Chu but Gengar wasn’t there then and i didn’t take any from mom’s bunch(all laugh)Butterfree didn’t come back then cause that was his first breeding season but Primape did so on the finals i had,
1.Pikachu,2.Togedemaru,3.Heliolisk,4.Squirtle,5.Kingler,6.Abomasnow,7.Charizard,8.Talonflame,9.Emboar,10.Tauros,11.Primape,12.Pidgeot,13.Bulbasaur,14.Whimsicott,15.Noctowl,16.Meowstic,17.Metagross,18.Pangoro,19.Buzzwole and 20. Muk (all laugh)
Whimsicott’s current behaviour i guess stems from the fact that he was most used during Kanto as i had Meowstic and Pangoro earlier Metagross was way later the last so those 2 were only psychics and later had Whimsicott so being a fairy he could enter those but also only had two grass types and thus he also was there to make it three and so was hectic stuff(all laugh)...
in 9 typesof competition
Fire was Charizard,Talonflame and Emboar
Grass was Whimsicott,Bulbasaur and Abomasnow
Normal/Poison was Tauros,Muk(all laugh) and i could use Pidgeot,Noctowl,Heliolisk or Bulbasaur depending on situations
Water/Ice was Squirtle,Kingler and the obvious Abomasnow(both laugh)
Ground/Steel/Rock was my weakest point cause i didn’t have a ground or rock type at all(both laugh) so i used Togedemaru and then could use Emboar,Pangoro,Tauros or Primape but given situations like type advantage/disadvantage according to opponents and so on and all other stuffs and i had my first pure ground type at Johto only in Donphan(both laugh) and by then i was a one time champ(all laugh)..really don’t know how managed all those...cause Emboar,Snorlax,Pangoro and Tauros managed(both laugh) even Primape wasn’t there except fight competitions,Bruno said this brat is incensed if gets only one a match(all laugh) was a brawler then and thus now perfects the action of thinking without thoughts(all laugh)..utter brat that is..and Pidgeot went after Kanto then came in Hawlucha and Pelipper(both laugh)..well later in Johto i could use Solgaleo then cause he was steel still(all laugh)..not is though cause he’s born(all laugh)..
anyway,
Psychic/dark/ghost/fairy was Pangoro,Whimsicott and Meowstic ever(both laugh) later had Metagross of all pokemons but he was my last in Kanto..
Fly/Bug(both laugh) was Noctowl,Buzzwole,Pidgeot or i could use Talonflame as well if such situation arose and else..Butterfree did only one then went and after him i did only one of course..
Fight was Pangoro,Primape and Buzzwole and each of the 2 competitions were something(both laugh) Pangoro had most workload though Whimsicott became whimsical yet had far less workload it was just his nature but Pangoro never complained rather dragged me to competitions(both laugh) but now tells me you hallucinate(all burst into laughter)..what a bunch..
finally Electric was Chu,Togedemaru and Heliolisk

AND you must sit quitely and listen to whom i had in EACH LEAGUE(all laugh)..upto Orange that is(all laugh)..or else GENGLEYE(all laugh)..forget foods and all i’m RICH(all laugh)..

Delia(comes,concerned) : "Ash.."
Misty(laugh) : "Mom,he has to mean it..."
...(Pikachu and Greninja doesn't allow Tracey to enter)...
Tracey(bit concerned) : "um..Ash.."
Ash(hugging Misty very firmly) : "i'm perfecting my pose with MY MIST(Misty bursts into laughter),get off or else.."
Tracey(laugh) : "Ash,please it's Golduck.”
Misty(laugh) : "um..Ash i should go.."
Ash(frown) : "no,hold my hand and we both go(Misty burst into laughter)..no nothing else(Misty laughs even more)..that dumb bufoon.."
Delia(concerned) : "don't hit him"
Ash(frown) : "don't send Mime,i'll hit both then(Misty laughs uncontrollably)"
Delia(self) : "nah!had it not been for Mist,he would've gone completely mad(smile) that's
actually what he is expressing to Mist..(smile).."
.....(outside)...
Misty(takes Golduck) : "thanks Trace.(leaves,silently laughing)"
Tracey(bit shocked) : "Mi.."
Ash(angry) : "hey!hey you en.. Shut the f.. up!don't ever call my wife, don't ever talk to her,don’t ever look at her,don't ever come anywhere near her,don't ever hear her voice, don't ever.."
Tracey(laughing) : "man you need rest.."
Ash(smile) : "sweet sweet TraceyDaisyl(Tracey bursts into laughter),i need rest,right?"
Tracey(laugh) : "man,just calm down,i get it but you're only making it more and more.."
Ash(scowl) : "tell me Trace why is it exactly that the vultures aren't around here today?"
Tracey(laugh) : "um..i'm leaving..(trying to flee) "
Ash(frown) : "(Greninja hinders Trace from budging)...right Trace stand in front of me,yeah here(tells Greninja to stay aside,Pikachu jumps onto Ash's lap) see neither Greninja nor Pikachu exactly like you..so it's better that you comply"
Tracey(laugh) : "this is pure blackmailing.."
Ash(angry) : "you f.. shut the f.. up.who called me in the middle of the night to torment my already
stressed Mist up even more.."
Tracey (smile) : "Ash,Misty will forgive me but you were.."
Ash(extremely angry) : "so when are you releasing my speech to international vul.."
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash,please.."
Ash(angry) : "the silver screen,the radio,the tv,the internet,the gramophone,the godforsaken mobile.."
Tracey(laugh) : "we won't be able to express it in front of.."
Ash(angry) : "My wife?right?my wife,my wife...what is exactly Trace that everyone is suddenly concerned so much about my wife,huh?what do you want? do you want to see whether she truely longs for me or not if i'm just going to choke.."
Tracey(solemn) : Ash,please,be patient"
Ash(bursts into anger,but not high pitch) : "No i wont,what can you do about it?what can any
goddamn vulture do about it? the press,the cinema,the internet,the godforsaken Elite4,the
roads.. s..,the most beautiful enu.."
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash get into the Hall of Fame formally and just don't get into farming."
Ash(grim) : "cause Misty..no,what is it that now you're so concerned about,huh,Trace?,no let me
finish..what would my wife lose with those not being done? that's you point ain't it?"
Tracey(concerned) : "Ash,Misty.."

Tracey(solemn) : "Ash,please spare these for another day,you're going to Cerulian or stay.."
Ash(frown) : "so your saying that according to thev ultures,the husband should enjoy gay f.."
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash,take rest and let me go please or talk about pokemons"
Ash(grim) : "no i'll tak about anything with you if only you don't drag Mist in and more importantly,what is it Trace huh?you want me to show you that my ge.."
Tracey(shout) : "Ash! please, don't tourture youself like this and..oh no.."
Ash(laugh) : "my wife? isn't it? my wife..why and how..no if you dare leave or stop me,i'll set you on Thunder Chair immediately...what is it that people are infatuated with Mist,huh?yes,she has a less dark skin,yes she's less at bay with battles,yes she's less unfamiliar in hall of less mediocrity?
and? i know what they're thinking but I can be brutal as well,you still can't..(Tracey tries to say something)no don’t try that to be alive and no i don't care(Tracey sighs shaking his head) and
nobody comes anywhere near me if i'm home,else they know the result you barely managed to get the vultures off that day if they entered the place not one would’ve come out sane..get over the fact that how can a sweet flower like that wasn't picked up by someone other that the f..”
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash! could you doubt yourself if you heard those words in the middle of.."
Ash(laughing) : "words?"
Tracey(smile) : "exactly not Ash,that was your.."
Ash(angry) : "not this dumbnut again,ITS ME,not mine,and so now i've pulled off a stunning
publicity stunt,on one side to blindfold the family and on the hand to get all over the very next
b.."
Tracey(smile) : "Ash,they are none except Misty for you."
Ash(laugh) : "so you've finally been able to get around the fact that if a f.. Rhyhorn f.. someone
else's sl.."
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash,please,would you argue with me without these words?"
Ash(smile) : "most gladly"
Tracey(smile) : "well,same as yesterday,staring 1.what you see in Misty that you don't see in
others?"..
Ash(angy) : "i'm warning you last time Trace,my Mist is not a selling product(Tracey shakes his head sighing),my sweet little Mist flower is JUST MINE ONLY,if you are insinuating..if anybody..now that's it,from exactly this moment on,if,especially a half-grown en.. like you,manages two words with my sweet Mist,I won't be able to restrain myself but to personally make sure he that doesn't go home alive.."
Tracey(smile) : "Ash,this is your sketch..(hands over the sketch)"
Ash(looking at the sketch) : "thanks Trace.but..umm(bit shocked)hey(smile)hand me
over the other ones,Trace"
Trace(taken aback) : "Ash"
Ash(smirk) : "Green,Roy and Georgio and there's more,i'm personally going to erase all of those
godforsaken names that you're hiding behind your fake smile.."
Tracey(forcefully hugging Ash) : "Ash,please for her,stop killing yourself like this slowly,she doesn't know the end result that you.."
Ash(laugh) : "for her,for her,my wife isn’t it Trace my wife(Tracey sighs shaking his head)...Trace you tell me,except her sisters does she ever had anyone else? huh?no,no i need to understand this infatuation that Brock has had atleast the courage to honesty present in front of me,and i'm as you know,would ever be most happy if i could atleast,atleast with my these own very hands killed just ONE vulture from a group who insinuates that i'm the BEST choice that my..no you've crossed limits Gengleye(Forcefully),take Pikachu with you,(Very Sternly)Pikachu!buddy!tell professor Oak to send over all pokemons i've ever had and all those who wants to be present with me now..."
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash,stop them"
Ash(smile) : "(gently)see Pikachu,that he's a coward,(Pikachu and Greninja are extremely Agitated as are the
others,Ash tenders Pikachu and Greninja too,Gengar and Sableye patiently waits beside Ash,Mr Mime joins in,also agitated)just a sec Trace,Greninja go in,Gengleye just halt and you Trace you en.. just go in and(sternly) tell Mist and Mom,to not go to my room,i'm meeting you there,tell Mist,if you care for her so much,that i've ORDERED her to remain downstairs(sternly)do as i say,i have to manage my buddies,and cancel all your goddamn meetings,later just tell Gary i wasn’t in a good mood,IF YOU CAN GET OUT OF HERE..."
Delia(frown) : "Ash.."
Ash(concerned) : "Mom i've never demanded anything from you that you couldn't give me but if
you can please ride on Nivy and(Misty comes out,with solemn Face and closely observes Ash
for a few moments)Mist,dear this has to be done you've heard me,I'm a Playboy, it's not easy
with my kind,besides(laugh) it's only my first day,bare today,and no mom,i wont say things that i
promised i wouldn't and Mist,your're safe(sternly) NOW.."
(Misty frowns at Tracey and then drags Delia to Taloneflame)
Misty(whispering into Delia's Ears,laughing) : ""Mom! just a false alarm,play along for reuninon lunch there!"
Delia(stunned) : "but..ok"
Ash(frown) : "Pikachu,i'm fine buddy(sternly)go with Mom,Mr Mime,calm down..no nothing will happen,he's my friends only,Mime,(mentally)Gengleye take mom and Mist with you straight to lab and Chu will go with Mime on road,(spoken)i want all things to be precise,never disturb me and Tracey and (mentally)Greninja,follow me now just wait,(spoken)Pikachu obey mom and your Misty.come on Trace."
Misty(sternly) : "Trace,i've got Goldy back mind that,and I won't lose my Ash and my heaven at any
cost,no mom it's ok,it happens we're as we were saying,just a bit stressed,Pokemons are under fine
control,Ash,do you want another psychic?"
Ash(smile) : "i'm fine Mist,its only Trace,just go spend the whole day there they are overjoyed really (frown at Tracey)UNLIKE this mu..(Misty controls herself from not bursting into laughter by hugging Delia,who pats her),Trace will be held up here today,just take care of Daisy,come on Trace..what you're afraid of ME?ASH?No(sternly) Mime you too GO to the LAB with you Chu on foot,NOW..Sableye take mom and you(Gengar) take Mist and straight to lab.(sternly)ALL that are going FOLLOW MISTY and MOM,absolutely.GO."
(Misty silently laughs and leaves with Delia telling her just for surprizes and she too laughs later,they are on Gengleye,Pikachu and Mr Mime on foot to lab)
(in Ash's Room,with only Greninja)
Tracey(solemn) : "Ash,that was you ultimate urgency call.."
Ash(laugh) : "the most trivial false alarm and my Mist picked it up just as she saw me, aren't we
through all eternities a couple,Trace? What you think we're BEST or RIGHT or DESTINED or FOREVER for each other only don't you? (solemnly)Trace,Chu of all surely wouldn't have spared himself if it really were a true ultimatum and wouldn't have listened to even me as that was my order..Trace my real Ultimatum is that we fight till we die, individually that is including me,the
reason for that will not appear in this life of mine,UNLESS someone tried to be too interested in 3 things- my mom and her pokemons,any of my own buddies or my Mist and her buddies,Chu has already picked up the third and i never needed to utter in words or repeat an assertion to him-and you shall by now know all of it,relax i know my bunch,Greninja,stay sitted faceing the door and don't look back till i tell you to,right,you've created a mess Trace,no hand me your pokeballs(Marill,Scyther)hellow there sweet dolls(tenderly patting both Marill and Scyther who reciprocates fondly),join Greninja and do as she's doing till i tell you anything else,make sure door is locked(both comply)see Trace, your own pokemons will not obey you and i'm not even using any pokemon and Marill's been your for may be 22 or more years,you wanted to know why i'm the BEST,this is for the most trivial part-Ability" 
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash,i'm telling you,you speak all you want,i only supply infoes"
Ash(smile) : Trace,just hand over.."
Tracey(solemn) : "Ash,they had been thrown into the hottest fire the very next day then itself"
Ash(smile) : "Trace tell me-are you afraid of me? do i look sinister or am i more like a PLAYBOY?no really tell me."
Tracey(sigh,hugs Ash) : "Ash,i know what your thinking as well,none can."
Ash(laugh,breaks embrace) : "be better than,right? Trace,why did you draw those in the first
place,Trace you know what i know,and no it's just not trash talk but i can do it most politely too,i just love this,i call it the vulture style,i won't be alive would i if i don't do these AND have to be NOT SUITED ENOUGH for you know who?"
Tracey(solemn) : "Ash,just listen,just stop killing yourself like this..you know Misty was our heart-
throb,you were the reason why we all came together but you were never here,she changed her sisters,she was ashtonishingly good with the gym,a true epitome of perfection in
battles or performance or just as a human being-she was the ever sweet sister for Me and Gary and later Brock,when he was back,but Ash,this is your own home,if you want, especially now.."
Ash(laugh) : "so all you could do was to backstab me,right?”
Tracey(solemn) : "Ash,please,you know.."
Ash(solemn) : "i do know one thing surely.You know Trace in this very room i was telling Mist a
few hours back the exact same thing,but before that do you want to know why i actually suddenly
came back..”
Tracey(solemn) : "Ash,you two were.."
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "DESTINED,right?(laugh)Trace,stop it,please and don't interrupt me and listen.(solemn) I came back cause of an event after my Kanto Elite4 final was over,the formal dinner party at night,there,something happened and i was suddenly morally assigned to rescue the Cerulian City Gym Leader,had it been some other chances,(grave) my sweet Mist fower would’ve..anyway,but(laugh) you know what’s funny,you just can't imagine that i would ever accuse anyone here of backstabbing or could all those many years ago say what i said,could you?Trace bear with me,(very angry)that's my definition for what you were upto.Trace,I decided to take my bunch off from Oak Lab,be Kalos or Sinnoh,cause i just wanted to get away from all human relations and have only my Pokemons,or may be according to you,f.. around n.. s.. as you think i was doing since Unova and now that i wasn't keeping contacts i was doing even more so,(sternly)
Trace,i told you last night,i know what was happening with each of your own personal lives and (very concerned) look at Me(forcefully shakes Tracey)I'm only happy and nothing else for the choices you or Gary or Brock or anybody has made..no,i do know,Trace,but don't interrupt me else the result won't be good and that's the final time i'm saying this...(sternly)Trace you know my current position and that if i wanted i could've got much better f.. ocean of women than even MISTY WATERFLOWER and if she wanted she could get much better men than f.. ASH KETCHUM..(sternly)i'll set your own pokemons on you,if you're not listening with pinpoint mindfulness-i would've offered my mom to come,but it's her choice,i heard how Mist was doing before as you know the newses..(bit grave)my sweet Mist was slowly DYING a very..anyhow,i paid no attention at all,but then i had to come back and then suddenly my feelings are rekindled and so are we and upto the point where i've even given a ring and she has made the BEST DESTINED RIGHT AND FOREVER CHOICE,(smile)that's exactly the problem ain't it Trace,Ash Ketchum is suddenly back with Misty Waterflower and the vultures can't quite figure this one out or handle it,no not you the Vultures that are inside your mind exisisteing and laughing at me without any knowledge of you,so it’s henious that Playboy Ketchum suddenly patched up with Misty Waterflower of all people too much and is that wasn’t good enough there had to be a overnight marriage,(spelling)M-A-R-R-I-A-G-E wow,pretty dangerous(laugh)-(solemn)two questions Trace,why is it so that i hear,Mist was this,Mist was that,Mist did this,Mist did that,Mist was,was,was-(stern voice) MY MIST IS!(normal) why is it WAS,is she alive still or was she alive then(grave),answer this when i tell you very carefully cause it’s about MY ETERNAL SOULMATE MIST and the second is that is it destined,right,forever,best thats’s all or is it not in case of me and my wife?"
Tracey(sigh): "Ash,no the past tense is gram.."
Ash(smile) : "Grammar,indeed,grammar.(sternly)when Lance,who knew me when i was traveling with MISTY WATERFLOWER,whoose now the devil and i'm the supposed saviour and by the way
it pains me to say,but i must,you travelled with me in Orange,did i bed anyone?no still i'm warning you don't drag Mist's name ever into this,i won't ever be able to listen to anything like that about my
Mist and this is about me,not her,mind that.i didn't bed around in upto Sinnoh,now tell me Trace
because of my behaviour,and it was not right and i'll be the first to admit but in Unova i still hadn't
broken up and that (sternly) means no matter how much even if i wanted to,which i so so desperately wanted,i wouldn't bed around and(laugh) so many times went to the spot Trace,Ah!that smile,Ah!that sight,Ah!(stern voice,frown) THAT F.. B..(normal)..but about the last Month of my then relationship with Mist or may be the last two weeks or hell may be the Last 5 days,but why 5 and why not(extremely agitated) THE VERY LAST DAY? you were happy weren’t you that an immature fool wont trouble the GREAT WATER EMPRESS anymore who DESERVES so and so and so...(laugh)(stern)..Trace,i won't repeat this question again and if you don't answer,you know
what can happen to you..who was that f.. h.. b... that came out as i was entering the main
lawn,i didn't recognize him or bother about him-he looked just like any ordinary f.. man,but i you see can if i want i will find the b... out and his mentors and erase them by themselves withing next 24 hours or so by faking accidents and accidents,you know i had to be with team rocket,so i know these and would love to apply them even once and that too especially on those f..b.. Trace,i'm hungry,really,i so,so want to meet those 3,so much,but i'm not greedy Trace..but i plead with
you,Trace,please,please,Trace,please,give me the most beautiful b..,Trace,i beg of you..please.."
Tracey(sigh) : "Green Jacobs"
Ash(broad smile) : "right! no i would and do and will forgive him everyday and you know why,i
would even forgive Brock,i don't talk about Mist's family,they had too much to deal with,Gary never mingled into this though he desparately wanted to,his professionalism won't allow him,but the single person i won't easily forgive is(pointing at Tracey,extremy concerned)-YOU."
Tracey(solemn) : "on the charge that i didn't do anything despite knowing full well what exactly
was your wife’s then trouble that she needed to be chided out of the gym for a week to be with you at Unova?"
Ash(smile) : "exactly and you knew the best why the other way around wasn’t,isn’t and won’t be ever possible for me no matter what cause i don’t forsake my bunch no matter who and Mist could come and go safely and i was so so secured at Unova Trace when i began,you know me,i knew what her sisters thought,Gary and Brock but (grave)YOU BACKSTABBED ME,TRACE IT WAS EXACTLY AND ONLY YOU(normal) you're that one brat that knows everything in one glance and you f.. en.. you backstabbed me despite knowing everything,Trace,you'll always be her very own flesh and blood,the brother that she so much wanted beside her especially after she returned to the gym and always had EXCEPT when her most brutal personal problem arose..what did she do?"
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash,during Unova,when news started to pick up the steam and you were totally indifferent about all,she would whenever find me alone,just sob - "give my Ash back,Trace,he can't
live without me"(Ash smiles),it continued for a bit and almost everday you weren't there or wouldn’t bother,something was happening..then um..we had given up on you and.."
Ash(closed eyes,smile,gleefully) : “STOP!stop right there.just there,Trace,stop right there,(open eyes,smile),who was i trace?no,no perfectly heard perfectly answer,WHO WAS I IN RELATION TO MY WIFE?”
Tracey(sigh) : “boyfriend”
Ash(closed eyes,laugh) : “right,can boyfriends throw away girlfriends at mere will,no just as in common case you can be frank this isn’t about me or my wife..just go on answer it”
Tracey(solemn) : “yes”
Ash(closed eyes,smile) : “so you were right then weren’t you?(bursts into laughter)”
Tracey(sigh) : “Ash,please none of us got you clearly and your extremely deep sitted nature and strange outward antics to veil what kind of an abstract and abstruse person you really are and upto what level your obsession can go to know and just digest anything you wanted to,Gary knows you since day one and hence he knew the honesty part most which we didn’t to that extent outside your relation to your bunch and Dase ever thought you to be most egotistical and your dense character only aggravated the situation,all of her sisters and Brock to in later days thought you have changed your mind about Misty and he didn’t know your bunch exactly which i did and i knew what was happening with you but still in the very last days even i had had my doubts we knew Misty can’t be sane without you and knew you cherished her to your utmost but that nature of yours was too intriguing and you yourself have seen whhat it was,man just let it off you know,we’re a family now why cogitate these ...”
Ash(closed eyes,smile) : “just there Trace,just stop exactly there.Why is there a necessity of a LEADER there Trace even in family,why?”
Tracey(concerned) : “i see...are you saying we coerced her to lead us thus she became uncharacteristically responsible as the outward character?”
Ash(clossed eyes,smile) : “Trace,Trace,Trace,the whole world may need leadership but that’s except you and that i know,give up your damn idea of we and tell me why exactly was she acting as if she was the all sweet big-sister to everyone and no this isn’t about her sisters cause none can lead another if the another doesn’t want to be led so drop that please,this infatuation of moral leadership that totally drained the vitality out of my sweet little Mist for 14 years and had left her in a place where she was left,from where did this come Trace that’s all,yeah i was there for her for 7 or 8 of those atleast but she was in each night call too jaded not physically or mentally or emotionally,it was just her soul who she is i understood my sweet Mist flower gets drained each day of her vitality which she again recuperates from me and this pained me she ever said it’s ok,i knew all here and i knew all here as well EXCEPT YOU..you g.. en.. despite knowing everything was silently ENJOYING our relationship blooming cause why THIS IS LEADING IDEAL(Tracey shakes his head sighing,Ash laughs then sternly)..STOP THAT SIGHING IMMEDIATELY OR SCYTHER WILL CHOP YOUR HEAD OFF SOONER..(normal) and no,i understand very well about personality develpoment through stages and she was 21/22 when she returned but this idea of a GYM LEADER and Trace,i’ve seen too many of them,1249 except Mist including 1234 that’s innumerable hall of famers but this Cerulian City Gym Leader,what’s the big deal Trace what’s so big a deal it was that my sweet Mist never had the time to play around gleefully with her bunch and no that starship pain wasn’t a trouble cause she went into show business 2 and half long years later,but you know Trace i saw my Mist in Hoenn you know all about it,then i was charmed by my Mist beyond measures but then itself i felt sad about it after a few months,she wasn’t what she is in core(open eyes,broad smile) Trace,did you see her yesterday with me?”
Tracey(solemn) : “yesterday was because you were with her and when she came back first she was like that but then unfortunately she was pestered by all and then her own personality shined and became an ever sweet leader,and once you weren’t there the upper layer was there but inside she was totally torn apart and again you’re back and see the result and your problem is that why I of all knowing perfectly that she was going too overboard with responsibility didn’t do anything about it?”
Ash(laugh,closed eyes) : “Trace don’t tell me if i never existed Mist wouldn’t have been the real jovial playfull self that she is in heart...(bursts into laughter)..”
Tracey(solemn) : “no i don’t Ash but your idea of me not telling her to not go overboard had a reason and the reason was that it couldn’t be done given the situation there and you know perfectly well that Misty doesn’t want people to mingle with her decisions no matter how close they are to her but obviously you’re an exception in her case everywhere of her very being and..”
Ash(smile,closed eyes) :”self,of her very self Trace,anyway,continue..”
Tracey(sigh) : “yeah,right,i only can assure you that,that infatuation was what saved her otherwise she would’ve lost her mind there given who she is in heart and about your playing around with Pokemons,Gym is a place where you haven’t stayed 365 days constantly so i’d expect reciprosity on this account atleast that you never understood fully what it really means and she certaily did play around with her pokemons but yes may be she could’ve done that a lot more and should’ve but why does that bug you after 14 years when you yourself as we all know never bothered about what was going around there exactly those many years ago and thus was her relief all the time till your head spun for sometimes and then you know best what you were doing and still is continuing despite all”
Ash(closed eyes,laugh) : “so your trouble still is WHY MY HEAD SPUN,isn’t it Trace(bursts into laughter)..”
Tracey(solemn) : “why you won’t talk with your wife after 16/17 hours of nerve-wrecking providing your bunch your soul that they needed and provided back but your human for was and still is your trouble and so yeah,that solace you wanted pokemon discussion yeah,she never wanted to and cause we all knew and was later told that she wanted to settle down with you and have a family after you returned from Sinnoh that only got the matters worse for her your indifference that is..so yeah that was my confusion but now i know it was your’s as well hence all these 4 years..”
Ash(closed eyes,smile) : “right but Trace,did i need my Mist beside me all the time and also did Mist need me beside her all the time AND Trace this is even more serious,can my Mist still be a leader and show all her moral leadership and etc qualities that the world knows her for AND yet be playfull and jovial that she really is WITHOUT the two interfering with each other?”
Tracey(solemn) : “the answer to the first is no with the small condition that given both of your personalities you need to pass a week each month together all alone atleast no matter what as i know very well Misty needs it and now the whole world knows if you don’t have her for a prolonged perdiod,you won’t act like what Misty did but will get other people involved as well as you will jump out of your abstraction and try to drag everyone there(Ash bursts into laughter)..(sigh) yeah your Tyranitar and Madgaleo(Ash laughs even more) and become absolutely sinister on anything and anyone and the answer to the second question is yes,given she gets what she wants and you know best Misty isn’t someone who can do it all alone and hence your beautifuls were given the basic entry to begin with.that’s all for your both questions.”
Ash(closed eyes,smile) : “pretty true,Trace,pretty true,Tyranitar and Solgaleo are so sweet my little Solgy and Tyrie(laugh),so what was the instruction and what was the grievance and Trace what happened when the light got cut according to THE ILLUSION?”
Trace(solemn) : “well it wasn’t an illusion then to anyone cause who sweared me didn’t get the full implication at all and may be failed in that pursuit most abjectly but when the light was cut and the darkness prevailed which you of all certainly would’ve been the first to assume the depth of the darkness and did perfectly assume without knowing that you yourself were the whole illusion as well as the whole darkness to begin with and to counter that impending darkness you took some measures which included a certain measure that was your instruction to me not to give up no matter what on my desires and yet still be who i am and you know very well what i got,so i get you but this obsession of yours that why we never realized the illusion and the reason that was you and that comes from the premise that why we never realized you and thus why did we never realize you and  didn’t force you to comeback cause 300 and 72 you said yourself and all knew is just a number 298 and 70 makes no difference and even if you wanted the two numbers you still would’ve finished it even during the finals cause whole world knew who you were then and they couldn’t resist you at all but this obsession of yours to beat the dead horse repeatedly escapes me cause first,you and Misty are husband and wife now no matter the past and your discourse a few hours ago itself erased all bad memories for both you two and me and my wife and Brock and would definitely for Violet as well and it also totally erased if we ever had any doubt over your loging for your wife,so why did we never realize you is completely erased now as you know the best why so please stop killing yourself over meaningless matters.”
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : “bravo Trace,bravo you’ll be most special in () in () at Kalos and you know that yourself best.stupendus insight,brilliant language and penetrating excerpt..(closed eyes,smile)..beautiful man,beautiful man,beautiful man,beautiful..”
Tracey(sigh) : “Ash,please just come to the Lab with me and have your grand union.”
Ash(very concerned,closed eyes) : "that’s for them Trace,not for me YET(Tracey shakes his head and sighs) so to proceed Trace,i didn't need Mist,neither did Mist need me,we could've moved on,we both were extremely successful in our careers and had everything at our plate,she
reached that level way before i did that is the name and i know my names across my career but she at Kanto-Orange-Johto has been huge since she is 25 when i wasn’t at that level at all only after Sinnoh i was and hence(laugh) the Gengar is what he is none sane comes anywhere near me and this should’ve been done by me exactly after Sinnoh(laugh)..anyway,but you said you had given up on me,right?did she follow suit?"
Tracey(sigh) : "no"
Ash(sternly,open eyes) : "ever?"
Tracey(solemn) : "she was puzzled all along till you broke into her room forcefully like.."
Ash(sternly,open eyes) : "i know what i did Trace,you tell me one thing that is I didn't need Mist anymore cause I had found a better life,THUS i had cast her off like a worn out tin can,was that the assumption?"
Tracey(solemn) : "no"
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "then it was just that i had sucked the life out of her for my neutrition and once i was famous i was done threw her away?this then?"
Tracey(solemn) : "no"
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "she was my childhood crush and on a certain glorious godforsaken day,i suddenly woke up from my teenage slumber,beaming with my youthful realization that Mist was JUST AN infatuation and along with the fact that me being so single minded in my career pursuits according to illusions again that i was only always a good friend but NOT BEYOND to ALL?"
Tracey(solemn) : "pretty close till your discourse"
Ash(laugh) : “Trace,what are and will eternally be my career pursuits if pokemons are with me temporally at same existence?”
Tracey(solemn) : “yeah,that abstract part and that absurd obsession of yours to extract better philosophy from them by which whatever you understood(Ash laughs) ever intrigued everyone..”
Ash(sternly,open eyes) : "Trace forget the discourse it’s plagarism the insinuation of which by the great legends is hindering the whole Lab for a long time now but leave all of that.Trace,i'll ask you two questions,(closed eyes,smile)
1.who broke up from whom?
2.why was this particular beautiful man of ours so interested in me?"
Tracey(sigh) : "1.none of you broke up or wanted to.
2.he understood the first."
Ash(bursts into laughter,closed eyes) : "so he went on that day to eavesdrop on me but Ms Misty Waterflower wasn't in the mood to tolerate him,thus he couldn't help.Trace that's what infatuation is when you don’t know who you are but you think you would by something or someone else,Green was devoted to Ms Misty Waterflower because she was his dream,she was the DRIVE behind his few travels not on Salamences though(bursts into laughter) yeah i know everything about everyone but(stren) I DEMAN TO KNOW A WICKED FOX LIKE YOU WHO HIDES IN THE BUSHES LITERALLY AND NOW AS IT TURNS OUT FIGURATIVELY AS WELL(normal,smile,closed eyes)..and he,Mr Green Jacobs,3 times champ,starter Piplup,later Empoleon,first region Johto,round 4,2.5 years,2 months break,next region Kanto frontier,2 years,Quarter Finals,three months break when he thought now,Trace,now he could confess to his Misty Waterflower but she was at Johto and TAKEN(burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head sighing)..why what’s your trouble Trace is it infidelity or promiscuity Trace what’s the CHOSEN WORD(bursts into laughter)..”
Tracey(solemn) : “Ash,please just cut it..”
Ash(frown,stern) : “MARILL(Marill comes and observes Tarcey for sometimes and waterguns him a little and then goes away)..(laugh)..don’t dare to misbehave Trace else the result you know more than me..(stern)SHUT THE HELL UP AND COMPLY..(normal)..then went to Sinnoh of all places should’ve been Hoenn there anyway,there 2.5 years after three months break here and reached semi-finals infact was great there and then returned when i was at Hoenn,man should’ve been at Hoenn,beautiful man,beautiful man,beautiful man(laugh)..anyway,then young flower dream was blooming around but didn’t get any through cause she was CLASPED(laugh)..what is it Trace that as Nivy says is of that age,what is it(laugh)..anyway,then stayed here again for 3 months then left for Hoenn of all places and 2.5 years and then the young flower dream inspiration works and HE WAS THE CHAMP(broadly smiles,open eyes,Tracey shakes his head sighing),why i can’t congratulate champs for being champs and it’s so excrucietingly hard to even qualify for the finals in 2.5 years why Trace am i not a sportsman,am i egotistical Trace..(stern)..AM I A PLAYBOY..(laugh,normal),no don’t bother to answer your pokemons are answering me(laugh) anyway,then returned when i just left for my Sinnoh journey(laugh) Mist never introduced any male friends of her to me for obvious reasons anyway,sweet sweet benchs(bursts into laughter),yeah man know everything from the devils themselves,(stern) BUT YOU EN.. MUST REPHRASE THEM AND WHAT YOU KNOW AND WHAT YOU ARE HIDING STILL..(normal,closed eyes,smile)..anyway,why didn’t you introduce him to me Trace,you knew him well,why(laugh)..anyway,then suddenly in overdrive went to Kalos of all places(laugh) and then that turned out to be the biggest nightmare with Salamences and Zygardes and Heatrans and Zeraoras and Darkrais and Deoxys’ and etc,etc,etc then after 3 months break at Cerulian went to Kalos as i said returned after 1.5  years and this time i was at Sinnoh but he stayed there for 1 year and a month at AH!Cerulian(laugh)..Cerulian,Cerulian,Cerulian(bursts into laugter),anyway,then i was at Cerulian but he was stricken by Salamences more than young flower dream hence didn’t go there but went to Viridian(laugh) and met Brock there and so on then one year later went to Orange of all places after knowing that i was f.. r..s.. 5 times each day mind the number(laugh,Tracey shakes his head sighing)..why just a number ain’t it(laugh),anyway,then went to Orange of all places and 1.5 years and WON(laugh) so that was 2nd title and then came back to Cerulian and then tried to patch up with young flower dream but then realized as many times before that Playboy Ketchum has spoiled her since 16 since the very first SCENE(laugh),what is it Trace that a scene can get you so much infatuated that too at 16 so that you’ll get married to that person after 19 years and 15 years of relationship huh(laugh) and the person still having left you for 4 years to r..s.. as well(laugh) anyway,then,i broke-up went undercover,he went to Kanto and so on, and then Mist never looked at anyone but just like me in Unova and a lot in Kalos,would tolerate and that guy was and stll is never impolite to anybody..(smile) beautiful man..beautiful man..beauti.."
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash,please,he was the first to admit his infatuation to us all as soon as he came back
from meeting you in Unova Elite4 and was in tears saying you could only be his idol forever due to your humility and warmth to a stranger like him despite he challenging you and even trying to defame you and just left,Misty was confused all along and never knew what exactly to do or feel and this refusal turned her into the actual nerve wreck that she became that she finally thought she was close to erasing you off but just then you again came up with all your glories and she just decided to burn herself to a sinister end"
Ash(closed eyes,smile) : "4 years Trace,4 long years-beautiful man.. beautiful man..that too when i was found in all beds every morning in Kalos NOT alone VIA the public gospel.. beautiful man,beautiful man,Trace i’m lucky ain’t i that may be even for a moment WHILE AWAITING the report,Ms Misty Waterflower DID erase me off SOMEWHERE?(open eyes,broad smile)”
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash,please stop torturing yourself like this"
Ash(sternly,open eyes) : "Trace,if you try to stop.."
Tracey(sigh) : "carry on.."
Ash(closed eyes,smile) : "beautiful man beautiful man beautiful man,comes back from Orange after victory,meets his crush,who scoffs at his too many advances,(open eyes,very stern),Trace,you being alive and this happening again if i die right now just after i finish telling you this won’t happen,if I die,Trace,pay attention to this PLEASE,(closed eyes,smile) i will die today just after finishing this,Mist will get depressed to hell but she won’t suicide by any means this i can tell you but if she wishes to stay alone,she gets that,if she wishes to move on,she gets that,so her family now all experienced which they weren’t then,only just stays beside her,she won’t directly tell herself even in her worst imagination or dream that i want to marry someone other than Ash Ketchum ever in this life of her which by now all you do know and thus she’s best left alone becasue her one requirement to marry a man IS DONE,she wants to have her family with me that ISN’T DONE and that exactly troubled her during Sinnoh break that she wanted to marry me and then afterwards when i returned from Unova would’ve had her family and hence that trouble escalated to that level when i was at Unova BUT she hasn’t have that second wish of her and thus STILL IS UNSTABLE NO MATTER WHAT..no it makes no difference at all Trace(laugh),all the many relations you see not all are what you and Daisy are they are random samples YOU TWO ARE NOT..i’m never blind Trace,there’s a logic and reason behind all anyway,BUT if she doesn’t want to stay widowed and the family feels so,the only thing that’s not to be done is to feed names and arrange dates or if she advances herself nothing is said about me or her samples or sample unless she asks to know that then and MOST IMPORTANTLY if only she by word of mouth to herself or to you or via written document wants you to do the advances do you WILL DO anything you want AND YOU WILL FIND MORE BEAUTIFUL MAN THAN THE BEAUTIFUL MAN I’M TALKING ABOUT and YOU WILL BE WATCHING OVER THE PROCEDURE but Trace mind carefully i warn you she won’t date anyone i know that even if she wants to in that situation YOU WILL LEARN HER WISH BY WHATEVER MEANS THEN FIND OUT THE SAMPLE THEN ARRANGE IT NO MATTER WHAT THE GODFORSAKEN WORK YOU ARE BUSY WITH CAUSE DAISY CAN HANDLE THAT BETTER THAN YOU AND EVEN IF I DIE NEXT MINUTE TRACE,JUST KNOW THE LAB AND THE WHOLE PERSPECTIVE WILL CHANGE TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL anyway,and if she does finally CHOOSEES someone AND gets the reciprocation,YOU WILL NEVER BY ANY MEANS BRING MY NAME UP AT ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND MY BUNCH DOESN’T MINGLE ANYMORE AT ALL WITH MIST,YOU MAY KILL EACH IF THEY DON’T LISTEN WHICH INCLUDES PIKACHU BUT DOESN’T INCLUDE MR.

PART 2 : MR HECTOR SKECHIT,CEO,(),WAS FALSELY ACCUSED OF ENCROACHING POKEMON INHIBITIONS IN THE NAME OF PROJECT WHERE MUKS ARE FOUND IN MOST NUMBERS WHICH MEANS WHAT YOU KNOW BEST..SOME SINISTER GOBBLINS WERE ACCUSING HIM CAUSE ONLY THEY HAD THEIR SOULMATES IN KANTO ELITE 4 ITSELF,AND THIS NEXUS ALSO INCLUDED SOME OF HECTOR’S OWN SECOND COMMANDS,WHICH BY THE END WAS FOILED AS IT WAS FOUND OUT AND THIS THING HASN’T BEEN OUT YET CAUSE IT HAS JUST BEEN DONE AND KEPT SECRET CAUSE OTHERWISE ALREADY DIFFICULT KANTO POKEMON SYSTEM WILL JUST BUST CAUSE THEY THEMSELVES WOULD’VE DONE THE ENCROACHMENT ONLY WANTED THE LEGAL POWER RESOLVED AND NO MUKS WOULD’VE BEEN ALIVE NATURALLY.ANYHOW THIS TROUBLE IS RESOLVED AND HECTOR HAS BEEN TOLD ABOUT HIS BROTHER’S CONTRIBUTIONS ON MUK ESPECIALLY AND MANY MORE IN DETAILS AND WHO HE IS DEPITE HOW HE WAS TREATED IN DETAILS SO THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS MIGHT BEST BE LEFT TO HIS BROTHER WHO GETS A SPECIAL PRIZE NEXT MONTH.THE END.now,LISTEN CONTINUATION(smile,closed eyes)...of our BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL MAN...beautiful man,so he sees two beautiful trophies from Battle Frontier and Sinnoh of all,the so-called nonsense miracle stunned a true legend by all means named Laura Berlin of all times,what to speak of any mere mortal,so the beautiful man checks on me,sees the break-up,then understands that he may have a chance but then isn't sure of himself due to no reciprocation,then beautifully goes to Kanto and wins each particular gyms except Cerulian obviously which i went to the information of which was suppiled to him by someone whoose too overjoyed now due to a certain discourse,so our beautiful man beautifully wins the beautiful league,yes,WINS THE LEAGUE,beautiful man,beautiful man,beautiful man..(broad smile) the very first beam of morning dawn/when i first saw you in my heart’s lawn/since then i see you every then and now/(opens eyes,extremely stern and grave)/all your stool,pus and urine here’s take MY BOW.(again closes his eyes,smiles)..beautiful man,beautiful man,anyway,in the meantime two other more beautiful men come around in similar vein almost but obviously at complete bay from around everywhere,all the while they were talking chance of a poor girl’s inherent sweetness while she never wanted to show thus her mask of responsibility but couldn’t help and was suffering enourmously cause some f.. b..,yeah right you heard F.. B..,no no i know perfectly well who Justin Ketchum was and who Delia Ketchum is and why but this title that I definitely deserve is due to who I am Trace not my parents.anyhow,this f.. h.. b.. decided to REJECT her whom she just can’t forget at all,beautiful men,they were good but turned out to be less beautiful than our champion beautiful man,and all the while all the godforsaken Cerulian brats had the audacity to pester around for their utter incompetent badges to be replaced by Cerulian badge..beautiful brats,beautiful brats,beautiful brats..anyway,please forgive me for this but see Trace,it’s just..just so beautiful to see such beautiful vultures who are born in my mind and currently insinuating in my mind that LUCK Trace,LUCK is VICTORIOUS..ah,i can hear them Trace,i can..’GLOURIOUS!NO I WON’T GIVE IN NO I WON’T GIVE IN TILL I’M VICTORIOUS! AND I’LL TRY AND I’LL TRY,WHAT EVER THAT’S MUST!UNTILL THE END YES UNTILL THE END TILL I’M VICTORIOUS!OH SO GLORIOUS!OH WHAT A JOY,OH THIS GREAT JOY,THAT NOW I’M VICTORIOUS!IT’S SO GLORIOUS!GLORIOUS!NO I WON’T GIVE IN,NO I WON’T GIVE IN TILL I’M VICTORIOUS!”’..(burst into laughter)..what a song..anyway,right..so thus this picture...our first beautiful man hangs around then goes to Kanto,wins the league Trace,wins the legue,so hard Trace ain’t it,so so hard,2 long damn years,i never won it Trace,you should’ve straight said that to me shouldn’t you,by the way why this beautiful man didn’t win Sinnoh,Johto and Battle Frontier too,why is he not a POKEMON MASTER...why Trace,you could’ve told Lance you all knew him to make sure there’s a provision insinuating that this beautiful man never got what he deserved for his PERSONAL INFATUATION WITH PERSONAL INFATUATION WITH INFATUATED INFATUATION..beautiful man..so he returns,then just then Trace,those two trophies are nullified,after all Trace,Orange was the easiest league wasn’t it during my time?and of course Battle Frontier is obviously the side-show which none knows why everybody has to participate in and WIN most of all,Hoenn of course you know that a certain gym in Pettelsberg now in Hall of Fame was all the way with me HIDING my ulterior activites their which will get my Hoenn League rescinded as soon as this priceless knowledge is included in the public gospel first line in the cahpter named Playboy Ketchum anyway finally Sinnoh,a fluke,surely you of all know a Pikachu’s self heal level extremely well,absolute fluke and then Unova(laugh) you know i used illegal substances and also till the end of my journey right(laugh)..so Trace you being at lab why don’t you give the witness to get me out of this profession after all(laugh) anyway,beautiful man,beautiful man..anyhow,so the beautiful man come in dares to sit beside someone..um..may be TOO TOO TOO close wasn’t it Trace(burst into laughter),no Trace don’t bother,that Misty Waterflower,Kanto Water Emrpess wasn’t my Mist at all that was an illusion totally meaningless useless full of garbage,my wife Mist was EVER inside me,she never can leave cause i carry her around myself JUST as your own understanding is of your own life..great discourse right,should fetch me a Hall of Fame oratory anyway..anyhow,this beautiful man beautifully sits in beautiful ways and a few times may be by then you all decide this is it as the beautiful man was with a dead someone who never knew what was happening around,body Trace you’ll know,henious ain’t it if you’re less dark unlike me no matter whether your mind is alive at all or not..beautiful man..beautiful man..no don’t bother i’m in the exact middle not less not much dark that is,6 ft 2 at 86 presently and Mist 5 ft 10 at 69 now just right weight should be at 75..anyhow,so we continue with our beautiful man and then my eldest sister-in-law wants to prize the moment cause she had to face all the problems regarding what a gurdian faces with a depressed kid who was a very sweet and good kid despite obviously certain brats roaming around if she is in the gym that to in the Cerulian of all f.. places...so anyhow,a gentleman is told to,the gentleman goes forward,then as the gentleman has ever done,he says this observation can’t be true,so the gentleman breaks down when my sister-in-law reaches him,asks what is it,the gentleman explains himself AND confesses everything he has to confess and then finally the gentleman and my sister-in-law realizes exactly at that moment exactly both in profuse tears and then and there all was said for which a long time was required due to certain vultures roaming around inside their heads and of course this veil over reality which takes a bit of time to get rid of but DOES get rid of and no DIAMOND can be covered EVER by any dust particle thrown by wise men who trades in the great public gospel that’s exactly what a certain discourse reminded them of..that they’re soulmates..yeah the gentleman can hug me to death all he wants(Tracey tears,hugs Ash firmly)..but the thing in between as the illusion was all about uncertainty over which is what THUS being a gym leader it’s impossible to keep track of everything if you have family responsibility and all hazards that Cerulian brats representedly present thus it was the other way around as there was ample time to do what a gym-leader can’t do in personal life unless there is proper help..thus persistence per precise perception..that’s the thing,gentleman,which obviously a f.. b.. like me needed a too long time to realize fully,anyhow,this gentleman has never been dishonest ever in his life which is what a certain discourse is all about and hence their happiness cause all those listened were ever such thus the friendship the bond the family that exists and everywhere there were a glitch which was just an illusion but the venerable elusive vulture whom i’m killing now was trying the dirty feathures at another illusion and still is that it was DESTINY as if by DESTINY any random such other samples are perfected and because it’s not true hence the word SOULMATE and not DESTINED BEST MATCH,anyhow so this picture,let me see,got that,when our beautiful man tries to do the confessing himself gets another beatdown gets too angry goes to chase a playboy with a dreaded public name and fame and Pokemons in Unova Elite4 of all places a region about which he knows absolutely nothing but gets dissapointed cause his sworn-in enemy turns out to be his greatest ever friend as he gets saved from public humiliation that would’ve simply taken away all his achievements and all pokemons except the starter and his license to be in Pokemon World by any means..what a risk this beautiful man took JUST because of his beautiful infatuation with infauated infatuation,Trace i didn’t do it and would’ve never done,why Trace,why did this beautiful man wasn’t given the picture...why?cause he was mingling personal matters in battles which is the first thing prohibited in our code of conduct with the most serious penalty of life suspension and he took THAT risk against a PLAYBOY in a totally UNFAMILIER region where he wouldn’t have got any first hand helps,why was he not rewarded Trace for GALLANTRY,why?...anyhow,this beautiful man is beautifully given his beautiful life beautifully back despite having no reason to be so and then he beautifully breaks down to his enemy,begs pardon beautifully and returns also beautifully and again begs pardon for his mistakes even more beautifully and beautifully leaves by all beautiful means beautifully with is most cherished beautiful infatuation having been beautifully cured- LUCK Trace is indeed VICTORIUS ...now there’s another sister-in-law of mine also gets mentored like my other sister-in-laws except another sister-in-law so she gets the professionally balanced professor who realized the whole trouble but if he mingled he would’ve been dishonest with himself,so yeah that trouble is also solved there and that’s exactly how he and my youngest sister-in-law realized the morning discourse,PROFESSIONALLY TO FIND YOUR THING WITHOUT ANYTHING ELSE NO MATTER HOW ALLURING...so all this was happening,and my middle sister-in-law as ever was only very focused in artistry in which she is a world famous name but that damn Kalos region never invited her or any of her 3 sisters cause Kalos had whatever...anyhow there was a self proclaimed lunatic doctor in Viridian who had every quality a MAN dreams except his infatuation that his physical condition isn’t right so his father had to be insinuated but this doctor before that needed to cure himself up,which took some time and then finally he gets the right things finds that truely this lunatic infatuation was self proclaimed indeed and nothing was there at all due to an accident so many years back and a prognosis which was itself confusing which was just unfortunate...then this doctor also realizes the illusion and also finds the soulmate and vise-versa in my 2nd sister-in-law who had only this doctor in her whole life for reasons best discussed in a certain discourse so thus the word DESTINY so beloved in the public gospel is beautifully NULLIFIED as INCOMPETENT IN THIS CASE..these all takes place around 2 years back when i was in Kalos,the gentleman is there the next year..so these are perfect,now most importantly, gentleman,i wont stop swearing your head off linking you with all imaginable vultures or stop your own Scyther to literally do that cause he’s more incensed at this exact moment at this emotional buffooness as he never saw the gentleman moaning like a f.. wh.. like this even when he had no chance to be alive in a certain Muk inhibition so it’s better that the gentleman acts like what the gentleman is known for and immediately budge from doing what he’s up to and start laughing which is how a playboy plays the tricks,if your undercover,you get to know many many beautiful things given you come out ALIVE,like i was in Orange when this gentleman was drawing pictures of two persons who sat more closely than any word can define, out of which a certain picture too romantic yet too polite and so sweet that that personal moment can be taken as UNIVERSAL and that’s why this gentleman was so delighted about it which of course in his own case couldn’t happen cause it wasn’t the reservation but the room thus deviod of bushes and also no beautiful man or woman can ever draw personal moments of OTHER people UNLESS they understand that this is his or her family and that is also why this DESTINY isn’t suitable here.now this picture that a certain playboy rescued from the gentleman’s youngest sister-in-law’s room when he tricked her..ONCE A PLAYBOY,EVER A PLAYBOY..by the way gentleman,had a certain person acted more calmly yesterday,the pose would’ve been a bit better for which the gentleman is all invited to draw another which he has so wanted since a certain illusive incident that never happened and this time the gentleman will get his soulmate’s support on this to spot out the exact time and place to do so but the only objection to LUCK is that the gentleman ever had to see his life’s reflection in 3 cases out of 4 and the 4th being him unfortunately none of the 3 can draw such pictures which especially includes a playboy who was dumb enough to follow the gentleman around in certain bushes without knowing what he was doing and obviously getting caught by many pokebrats,besides that room had a fireplace thus the tears from both ends...but this gentleman the greatest honour to be the first human specimen on which Crawdauntogator pulled their tricks to practise it later showing it to none other than the greatest boss in Team Rocket,Snorlax tried his q/a session,Torquail demostrated all her moods,Bayleaf lectured about her proper caring of improper precision,Marshadow wants to know about the height of trees and grass and how to adjust them suitably and Gengleye has perfected all tickling,pestering and scaring tricks(Tracey laughs),by the way all these are rasons why Crawdauntogator has been condemed to the Professional Professor’s place making his balanced life the greatest imbalanced hell(Tracey laughs) so shall Scyther be called or shall the gentleman stop what he’s upto,besides gentleman,you’re devoid of salt by now why don’t you start drinking all the liqueded vapour and viseversa back(Tracey bursts into laughter)...right gentleman,now that you know what the playboy tricks are all about then please,please,i beg of you,please,let me finish...now so in direct terms,Lillie and Daisy just
found themselves and their soulmates AND viseversa and only could be beside her all the time but similarly confused as to what should be done and Violet being Violet-just don't understand anything except her own performances AND Brock and is so happy to stay just as that,i'm so glad that Brock realized that too that if there was one it was whom he has,though that brat has a long long very long raod left to be travelled with ME..they all really are sensational,really generally such pure souls are not found here and no matter how much dust they catch,they're never ever tainted and none more than you 3 know that,which is why i’m most incensed with that f.. city and which is why this great elusive mental vulture is a bit confused now,anyhow then you thought that this is family now so the youngest sister-in-law must be looked after a bit too much and obviously the playboy became the greatest villian which he wanted to,to get his trap set for himself to be sure of the soulmate theory he was intuitively ferrying around among all without grasping it himself so some men were beautiful and out of which the most beautiful man has alredy been dealt with and so on..and the man,beautiful man,beautiful man,beautiful man..But all this all had to be in a godforsaken city like..anyhow(opening eyes,very sternly and harshly)still i haven't got my answer"
Tracey(smile) : "if you already know everything.."
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "No Trace these are all empty bowls,i want (open eyes,sternly)PUDING(Tracey laughs)(closed eyes,smile)..i'm hungry Trace,i'm hungry,(growls,open eyes)don't dare interrupting me"
Tracey(laughs) : "go on"
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "sweet,sweet Trace,as my flower went to that true f.. of a gym after she had to part PHYSICALLY with her soulmate after his Johto journey,she was shoved down a
bunch of confusions and goddam rules which either are getting lifted or the gym gets 100 fire types who’ll,presided by a certain Talonflame with the flight directors post at Cerulian nights(Tracey bursts into laughter) anyway so my flower initially was struggling,then you were called there for all sorts of help,didn't you?no i,sweet little Ashy-boy of Pallet knew but(growl,open eyes)I,ASH KETCHUM, MASTER PLAYBOY, DEMAND TO KNOW..(sweetly,closed eyes) what did
you see?"
Tracey(smile) : "she was a miracle worker"
Ash(smile,opened eyes) : "WAS?"
Tracey(laugh) : "AS ALWAYS FOREVER"
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "right.Trace is my flower sweetly playfull due to her natural traits or (open eyes,sternly) IS IT A VEIL(Tracey laughs and sighs,closed eyes,smile)..no Trace don’t sigh,i know the answer but what i want to know those initial days despite you think that why am i asking but please i tell you that me and THIS ME isn’t the same ,tell me Trace why were those 4 brats in 3 different occasions roaming around?”
Tracey(sigh) : “Ash,Misty is ever like that except when with you as you know,but yes,that nature was ever mistaken and those 4 wanted control first and then to show her the door and all,and yes her personality as it developed was ever like that except when you were with her,when she has as ever become an absolute child and forget everything else except having you in her arms or being in your arms all the time,her sisters ever mistook that as infatuation overdrive especially given how all caring,wisely sweet,warm,kind and gracious she was otherwise like a big sister to all and ever sweet friend to all having all possible good qualities and once ever skills to add to it,which as usual brats took advantage of and was scoffed off by her but as you know the in-you-language damn city and all they are infinite in numbers and neither she nor anyone else can pull off antics and speeches and language about most personal matters to anyone that is your recent hallmark(bursts into  laughter) so thus things happened but..”
Ash(closed eyes,smile) : “just a second Trace,just a sec,stop just there Trace,stop just there!(scowl,open eyes) why were those brats entertained by her supporting crew?"
Tracey(flustered) : "um..Ash, it's.."
Ash(growl) : "don't dare utter my flower's name,you'll not go out ever from here alive or
dead."
Tracey(solemn) : "Ash,its an eventuality and you know very well who i am"
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "sweet,sweet Tracey lad(Tracey laughs shaking his head),was there ever
any doubt throughout timeline?"
Tracey(sigh) : "Unova,226th Badge,that night you said something."
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "beautiful faces of beautifully prepared(open eyes,growl) beautiful b..,(closed eyes,smile)right"
Tracey(solemn) : "without any contact before and after for 10 days,then when she asked,just scoffed at her"
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "POLITELY i said ‘please,there are many woman gym leaders like you or may be even more successfull by all means from subtle personal and professional skills to gross beauty who are happy about their lives so why bother about waht’s happening around you,i’ll retun anyhow i can’t go on more than 30 months and will go back and stay and even think more,it’s all chill please,i’m only busy i’ve not forgotten you at all’->only the word ‘beauty’ was a henious crime i admitted to her later BEFORE break-up but this wasn’t scoffing to me but only to her then illusion was scoffing cause you know better which choised samples were roaming around the gym,just frustration from my part and by-the-way Trace,on hearing this she didn’t shout at me did she,only politely said she was being called for an emergency in the Pokemon reservation by Trace,what did she do then Trace?"
Tracey(solemn) : "she profusely cried to me"
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "she cried even more profusely to you another day a few days later to a day on which a certain f.. wh.. pulled a stunt on me which of course was the first thing included in Playboy Ketchum chapter in the public gospel and this was after my 239th badge in Unova and i only received any calls after 5 days to that as i needed to come into terms with many things despite my travel companions doing more than they could do to mitigate the situation and what did she tell you ON THAT DAY when i truely wasn’t polite to her at all when i contacted her after refusing many calls and she lost it that day on me but i want to hear her report again cause a certain vulture would otherwise REMAIN UNFRIED and besides Trace me and SHE never had a private life unless we wanted and in general was,is and always will be too happy about it cause who were eavesdropping us all time were family and ever treated us like that or friends who epitomises the word to whom our relationship was eternally too sweet as like the old brothers and sisters and close friends view and this also includes why a certain discourse was even possible at that time without a trouble and also will everyday be possible on different matters of common interest without any trouble given we all want it and would happily be possible which too proves that DESTINY is useless here anyhow, so these aren’t very difficult or different from your own experiences to be anyway uncomfortable,so what’s the answer."
Tracey(sigh) : “are you sure you still want to continue these knowing fully well all our current positions?”
Ash(broad smile,closed eyes) : “4 years Trace,every single day i’ve roasted all sorts of vultures and was roasted by equally many of various kinds as well,don’t disturb me while i’m roasting Trace this game so beautiful,no battle can ever give me unless for my bunch,so please,give me the answer.”
Tracey(solemn) : “she said she has lost you as you said that certain stunt was way better executed than a few you knew tried to pull on yourself numerous times and cut the phone off refusing further calls for 10 more days in your defense that the whole situation made absolutely no difference to you but in a language giving the exact opposite impression that’s always been your hallmark and is and will be only with your family which also validates your pose in between in tea shirts and a few stories you intentionally fuelled that had permanently sealed your playboy image perfectly those 18 days Ash,was it before of course what you did you did.”
Ash(closed eyes,smile) : “yes,may you please continue.”
Tracey(solemn) : “your self trials didn’t help your relationship or our already incomprehensible view of who you really were as we ever got your heart for all of us but never your heart for Misty which only she intuitively understood before your discourse today and of course now you both elaborately know everything but you still want to play meaningless games which i know is despite her requests so anyway,then you contacted and were as nonchalant as ever and she always cried to me saying that she has lost you then during the last month before Unova finals your showboating was at absolute best when you were giving strange implications to everyone confusing them all the way and then you came back and the break-up was inevitable”
Ash(laugh) : “Trace,did you know my brats at Unova and especially during finals(laugh)..”
Tracey(sigh) : “yeah,they were lunatic and fed on you and the viseversa and you couldn’t reach that level cause of your Mist flower and hence now only fully happy..”
Ash(closed eyes,smile) : “right,i’m telling you how we broke up which probably you know as well the central theme was our success despite our physical distance and this was the final knail in the coffin which a certain beautiful man sensed and thus was so overjoyed that for him such was not the case but only for his whole beauty to completey evaporate for this life the very second he saw that no emotions or stunts or virtues or destiny or luck or anything can fetch you things that i’ve been bestowed upon simply due to my bunch and NOT ME but why my bunch is that anybody can interpret so this beautiful man found his unbeautiful but true life and is doing very well in Orange Elite 4 office at Lumberg Isles,a place that you may have to go soon for MY Lapras UNLESS she is at Unova with me and 105 colleagues barring Mime and Chu and the beautiful man was told by Tauros to his bunch who wants to attack you or your master that’s the ego infatuation illusion that forces one to work against the self anyway,that was that and thus this whole game.so anyhow,we did break up what happened the next time you were present there but before that what you did in the previous times when she expressed her concerns about my (open eyes,broad smile) MOTIVATIONS?(closed eyes,smile)...”
Tracey(solemn) : “ ‘as long as i know Misty,Ash has never even looked at a girl with a remote hint of care beyond professionality or as a sister or family relation and never even friendship except you and you only and you know well how many he has had to encounter and now having to.and you also know his bunch is at what state it creates impossible nervous pressure that i’ve told you.probably with all these his head has spun a bit,he’ll come back don’t worry’-this first the second time just consolations cause i’ve had my doubts over you then but still told her it’s just an accident he probably is fed up with himself and too ashamed to face you give him some time..but you continued your antics so by that last day i had in a way given up hope but might still have told her after break-up that she still may contact or you may contact but you know best you didn’t want to and she the same. ” 
Ash(closed eyes,solemn) : “but i hear that you didn’t do anything at all while she DID think of reconcilation during my undercover days and afterwards when i came back ALIVE out of there,the whole world Trace knew who recruited me,surely you of all did too,and surely you know everything that Mist ever wished cause you’re his damn older bro and so was it a financial matter Trace that despite being at () you couldn’t go to () while there for MY Samurott?”
Tracey(indifferent) : "um..Das.."
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "no need,i know her,(stern) YOU WERE THE CULPRIT FOR NOT MARRYING HER THE YEAR I WAS UNDERCOVER(Tracey shakes his head laughing),after break-up Daisy spoke to you first of all and told you about her reservations over me second then thirdly opined it’s better to move forward but i know only perfectly well that all my sister-in-law was wanting was a steady hand behind her baby sis which her baby sis has ever needed but my sister-in-law never broke through the playboy that she saw and later heard and saw till that discourse and i know perfectly well what you would’ve done to anyone wouldn’t do to her and why as well as why she did what she did and why,no i don’t point my Fingers to any of you at all and by now you know it,besides Trace,this is among brothers never bother(open eyes,sternly) OR GET EMOTIONAL LIKE A MAN-WH...(closed eyes smile),but with our publicity,vultures got a chance,but my Finger is pointed to the exact vulture who appeared in both of your minds that day Trace,whoose now in my mind but getting roasted severly and WILL be EATEN very soon..anyhow then you didn’t take any action even before undercover like screaming your head off to me which you know and knew perfectly well would work due to me and your relationship every day?"
Tracey(solemn) : "no"
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : “or Mist?”
Tracey(solemn) : “no but that confidendence wasn’t there each time actually as i just told you.”
Ash(close eyes,smile) : "right,then suddenly i had to go undercover and nobody knew my whereabouts barring Sinnoh Elite4 HQ’s 2 persons,Trevor and Allen,Head and Deputy-Head,in this whole goddamn world...and after that the 1 month i was in public glare you also remained inactive due to views but Trace none would want to wash the dirty cloths in public unless extreme conditions so drived by what motive did this break-up got outside the godforsaken Cerulian Gym in the first place which attracted the two other more beautiful men we’ve already spoken and in the second place why this IDEA that there was ever ANOTHER BUT Ash Ketchum’s future form which was the RIGHT replacemnet ever arose,sure it wasn't the most beautiful man to first announce to the world of a certain break-up and then to propagate the advertisemnet that a certain Ms Misty Waterflower is accepting invitations for dating was it Trace?"
Tracey(solemn) : "can i tell you something?"
Ash(close eyes,smile) : "most honoured"
Tracey(solemn) : "you.."
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "sweet sweet Trace,what was that?i wouldn't ever have reached the level had i ALWAYS,ALWAYS been WITH her and she wouldn’t even MORE so and THUS i was USING her and then threw her away as soon i got what i got right?(laugh)..so she of all should’ve followed suit(bursts into laughter)..no Trace,no,i understand ALL,you see Playboy Master Hall of Fame,Trace,so difficult,so elusive than all legendaries you’ve never read about..Trace,confirm it,Trace,these Vultures are really in for a game RIGHT NOW,Trace I haven't battled in ages just fooling around,give me vultures Trace i'm hungry,i want to BATTLE,Trace please, wasn't this what the vultures are insinuating that from the beginnig till the discourse that Ash Ketchum is the WEED of the family disturbing the main trunk and thus must be torn apart with immediate effect(laugh),Trace the weed himself did the job for you didn’t he?(bursts into laughter)...no wait..Trace i frankly tell you,i don’t need any of this,the way my Mist is devoted to me,i can settle down in Kalos where no vulture knows my Mist too well so that she won’t ever be pestered and i can give a water Gym to her there with infinitely better challengers and facilities that she long deserves,or i can simply tell her you won’t be active in this profession anymore and she already herself has volunteered to do so and there everyone knows me and so on neither me nor she need to ear for the rest of our lives atleast and our future will get maximum everthing as per the wishes but then again i can settle down anywhere in the world WITH Mist and have absolutely no contact with you and Mist would follow suit as you’ve seen with the bare minimum contacts with her family but that’s not important at all Trace cause none of those hinders any of us as it hasn’t as you know as i myself told you but why was it then Trace that this STILL is a problem,you couldn’t forget me neither could i though i was very very close cause i would’ve lost my mind in sheer joy of becoming a pokemon,a Gengar as they said and truely you know my Gengar why not Trace why not what was left for me here to not be a Gengar after all EXCEPT my Mist and Mist too would’ve you know went in full lunacy had i not broke into her room,your lives wouldn’t have been remotely hindered due to whatever happens to us but somewhere a darkness would totally devour you all up for the rest of your lives and if we’re alive we’ll as well follow suit but even these Trace are absolutely trivial as what is most important Trace is that discourse or swearing (open eyes,broad smile) DO YOU SPOT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIRE AND THE HEAT (closed eyes,smile)?"
Trace(sigh) : "at that time you never realized the full implications Ash,neither did we,Misty created this family of ours alone by her ever sweet personality but that’s not important at all as you said.The real trouble was and ever will be in future given such case arise again throught the temporal barrier that you were the central reason for Misty to be even alive despite of anything else and so you were the centre that time which is now a family still from that same position and i realize you were vulturing around on us behind the curtains and made sure that the family isn’t disturbed as i also know why my partner and bro Gary who ever told me everything in his way except why he never believed that you had truely rejected your flower as one day while his wife shouted at him and i accidentally was present there cause that was the only time Lillie ever came into our main office room,a restricted place and told him about her youngest sister’s then () abuse and to cut off all contacts with you to which Gary didn’t react but after she left just told me that you weren’t someone who would forget us even if you’ve truely rejected your flower only and all because you in his word ‘he despite all did do me one of the biggest favours’..anyway so the family was still taken care of without their knowledge and you only gave your quotes or swears but you knew that’d help your brothers given who they are and you wanted all to be happy and not start a conflict because of you yet made the mistake of thinking that you yourself weren’t needed in the family and fooled us into actualizing our all illusive mistaken intuition of your soul that you were indeed a weed after all despite what we were seeing and went to absolute overdrive yesterday to make sure we truely do reject you even including Gary of all but and as soon as you got your flower back,see all things are in a whisker back to what it should've been certainly 3 years ago if not 4,had you had the intelligence to atleast once speak properly with Gary of all about personal matters but you only created more tension fooling everyone by being elusive and mouting everyone off through press,in 4 years we all have had our lives despite Misty,but it was as if the X factor wasn't there only because Misty was doing what she was doing but you know well that we’re here due to Misty in actual level not like mouthing all off with impossibly insightful quotes served with dreadful swearing so that the combination help them forever in this life and  then tearing the source apart to show that the soucre isn’t needed at all and to create a self torturing hell.Misty at least didn’t do that and was beside everyone all time leading by constant example which is normal to your vultures and not by saying once only quotes delivered with such swearing that none can forget it but then vanishing in thin air then in internation press broadcast your grievance that many are inept at understanding the difference between bro and beau(laugh) and this didn’t help the situation at all as you supllimented your imaginary bride with it who is none other than Gengar(both laugh) and all of these are obviously the only possible normalcy according to the hell creating only to be conquering them again the vulture-killer(bursts into laughter) as it was to him when he decided not not show one hint to anyone of his own feelings fooling everyone by the veil of infatuation and cluelessness cause he wasn’t still the vulture-killer(laugh) and only ever letting his soul be his soulmate’s and being happy that if she knows you enough and then when she was rather confused due to her support crew never understanding this elusive antivulture,our great vulture killer rather tortures himself to death to see if his soulmate knows him or not..only once only never again hall of fame pests can pull off such antics and lead such other pokepests(laugh) anyway,so because of normal understandable support,Misty is so important to each of us and obviously as being the soulmate,only Misty will ever understand this all helpful self-destructive master’s soul and motives and thus Misty is all about you so by virtue all the family won’t spare you next time you try such antics with your language(laugh) and you can see that now even more vivdly through your all self created hells that you come back to normalcy for a half day and you can see what happens,this is what happens when you and Misty are together without your great elusive non existant vultures(laugh) and you and Misty must be together all the time otherwise both your lives will not be right and neither would be that of the family and yes Ash i do spot the difference between the fire and the heat that there really is no difference.but the thing is that why now does these..."
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "Trace,just stop there,would you?,Trace,please,I'm not finished,no matter how sweet your brief lecture was(Tracey laughs),i know what i know but i don't have my answer
yet and unless you give it, you're NOT going out of this room(Tracey laughs and shakes his head)...then Kanto Elite4 as they assigned me they said Misty was,Misty had,Misty did-(open eyes,stern)Mist IS.mind that(closed eyes,smile,Tracey bursts into laughter)...and i told them that as well that day and they were rather unknown to me and its a month or two ago at most may be..and they haven't dared to use PAST TENSE..no it's not grammar,my problem is that i've yet to let her roam freely without me since i've married her yesterday,oh! I get you!you want to know why rush the marriage,may be the most beautiful man could STILL return(Tracey sighs and shakes his head)..is that the trouble? or is it that last night made an impression that Ash Ketchum was also the Acting Master just like now what’s he doing(Tracey again shakes his head) and wants something out of this which i doubt,so you were happy,but it wasn't because of me,it certainly wasn't because Mist cause she was tormented the whole night till that discourse so it was because of,how beatiful the man was Trace in comparison to other beatutiful men(Tracey bursts into laughter)?..don’t laugh Trace,we’ve a LONG way to go STILL."
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash,we all thought your most beautiful man was indeed even more beautiful than the word most describes(Tracey laughs) and especially your eldest sister-in-law for the reasons you know more than her(laugh) and you also i guess have had long meetings with the man himself on Salamence den(laugh)"
Ash(smile,closed eyes) "at his office with Gengleye for 3 hours or so total 6 at Elite4 HQ Orange,they invited me(Tracey bursts into laughter) but sweet sweet Trace,i’m  a playboy master remember don’t believe me so easily,besides hey i'm dumping Mist tonight only
remember?"
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash.."
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "Trace,i've just figured out what the vultures are getting at..no,don't try pulling any stunts Trace,you know best how great YOUR OWN Scyther's blades are(Tracey shakes his head laughs and sighs)..the Vultures now are trying to land on the Greatest Spot that has
been accidentally opened,even more so after last night,this Trace is stupendous,mind blowing..
brilliantly chalked out..(Tracey bursts into laughter)..Trace,i can envisage them clearly,Trace,i can FEEL the simmering jubilation among them,so close to their victory,so much is the joy,so much the bliss from the hope that their impending victory is just about to come into fruitation,Trace,i can see them around me,just about to grab that spot,their happiness so tangible to me Trace,Trace(Tracey again laughs),answer me please,Trace,i beg of you(Tracey laughs and sighs),Is it possible that this time,this time once more(opens his eyes,smiling),that the vultures be successful in their insinuation that all that i said was EMOTION,all that i'm made of is EMOTION,(closed eyes,Tracey shakes his head)My heart wrenching longing for my own soul's different form,appearing before me in
all glories off which all i ever wanted,want and will want is just not to take my eyes off,not to take my eyes off from myself....sketch that it’s universal(Tracey bursts into laughter)...(opens eyes,smile) that all is emotion and for only a day/till i meet the roads.. s..,(very sternly)HAVE A VERY NICE DAY?"
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash,you don't.."
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "no Trace,i have to,i'm a Playboy remember,it's not easy with my kind,please,let me share with you the joy of the Vultures that they're having now..(open eyes,smile) i put my Mist through an emotional roller coaster to weaken her off and then jumped onto her and preyed upon her?(bursts into laughter)"
Tracey(sigh) : "You don't have to validate youself.."
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "what was that Trace?"
Tracey(deep breath) : "Ash stop logically validating your actions repeatedly to us.."
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "Actions, Trace? Actions?..”
Tracey(sigh) : "we know you well enough you never have been able to hide the honesty and frankness to the extreme degree that has made you into what you are and what you're feeling now
we all know Ash,we’ve gone through this same feeling but it's just..it pains us to see the
strain you are taking upon youself to narate them because you think your Playboy image is what
everybody believes in still after all you did and said,Ash please,we should be talking about the celebrations.."
Ash(smile and closed eyes) : "no Trace don't stop,my image,Trace i know all of you who you really are perfectly,perfectly well..Trace these are not for you these are for the vultures that are roaming around you only to grasp you in your one moment of unmindfullness which i myself was and thus my endeavour to absolutely kill any and all vultures in a way that for this life they don’t appear anywhere around ever again,so Trace,i'm a Playboy at heart and my honesty is a show(Tracey sighs and shakes his head),all that you hear,all that the Vultures insinuate on a moment to moment basis
is the real me,i'm not honest,i've cheated my entire life portraying this honesty,this veil so thick my
pokemons could never open it nor even my mom,this veil has given me everything,and due to
this veil i can take and throw away the Cerulian heart-throb whenever i wish,i can get in and out of Hall of Fame at my will,i can hold sway over other people and their pokemons at my leasure,i don't
have any feelings for Mist at all i just made her to believe me just like my mom just like everybody
else,hell,i've made myself to believe that i'm AN HONEST MAN..(Tracey sighs and shakes his head)Trace,this is,Trace so blissfull,this life of deceits,veils,you won't ever know what you
truly are...so amusing..so exhilarating..beautiful, beautiful man, beautiful man, beautiful man..(open eyes,broad smile) ain't it so Trace?"
Tracey(sigh,sternly) : "i've got nothing to say Ash but at this rate Misty will NOT have you alive in this body for long,if you want that just to prove to your dead vultures that you'll still want her the only,best of luck with that,but if you die now unable to take anymore of this devillish self torture,then you know too well what Misty will feel like and especially at this moment of her life no matter what you ordered me to do when you leave this body or you will do by will.yes she will be wanting you only and you know that very well thus your endeavour to make sure i,who have known your bond from the very first sight,destroy all pests away but the thing is that you could spare me,spare your mom and finally spare your beloved wife atleast the fractional moment of sadness when doctors are going pronounce today afternoon that Ash Ketchum is no more among us..if you want that best wishes..and i demand you to let me out of this self created hell to go and tell Misty that her husband’s time is very limited and Mrs. Ketchum that her son is in his last moments."
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "Scyther..no Trace..just to show you that a playboy doesn’t die as easily as you think he will..no,no,not so easy..(Scyther observes Tracey for a few Moments and Ash for a
few,then silently returns to his place)..saw that Trace? don't try to leave before the conclusion of this amusing game,this excuisite insinuation that that Vultures have come up with-what is it called in you book,that i'm doing with Marill and Scyther?"
Tracey(sigh) : "phychothrombonosis"
Ash(closed eyes,smile) : "Trace,what am i doing with you?"
Tracey(solemn) : "Lie Detecting"
Ash(closed eyes smile) : "word carefully Trace,plea.."
Tracey(solemn) : "your reading my hidden secrets and hidden traits by self torturing yourself towards death because you know if your honest not even the biggest crook can see in front of him life and death playing like this and ther psychophical condition of yours giving up slowly to this self exerted pressure thus psychical and mental death slowly devouring you while your soul is getting more more effulgently visible and giving a hallucination of transmigration in tangible sense and he’d follow suit except the physical part as you’re forcing your honesty to cut off his veil of anything and trying to touch his soul exactly what you did with Misty i think which has made your bond so quick and absolutely unshakeable for eternity through this life now and beacuse she is you soulmate she kinda..um..got dissolved into your soul."
Ash(closed eyes,smile) : "what would i gain?"
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash,all you wanted to do was what you’re doing now to your pokemons and you’ve succeeded in freeing them up in your words from this confinement of being to be the true self and you are doing the same with yourself right now and foisting that procedure upon me to make me understand this as well,but then you’ve ever wanted Misty,your very first travel companion,to be your wife and now she is your wife.."
Ash(closed eyes,smile) :"sweet,sweet Trace i WANTED what?"
Tracey(deep breath) : "so...um..your pokemons are your for eternity and viseversa and also Misty your forever travelling companion and wife came along and for a time being you wanted your pokemons to free themselves up from their psychophysical confinement and then you also wanted Misty.."
Ash(closed eyes,laugh) : "just a bit of a halt here,Trace just give me time,so just for a time being i wanted what of Misty?"
Tracey(concerned) : "um..you had a feeling for Misty which wasn’t of anything you just wanted your soulmate to be full and she the same then at 16 none of you had the words and hence only the unspoken actions and sweetness which gave me such a happiness cause it’s universal and you are my family only and the only thing that was ever obvious about her is that she has been wanting you so intensely since the day she saw you for the very first time and she never spares herself in her longing for you..and now finally has you beside her permanently for atleast once in THIS life,unless you want to again state that the Vultures are insinuating that this togetherness is an hindrence for you two to see how much you two actually want each other and rigourously try to disprove them by killing yourself right before her eyes"
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "What do i want?"
Tracey(solemn) : "Mi..no..um,you actually don't want anything..you have.."
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "what do i have?"
Tracey(solemn) : "Misty"
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "and?"
Tracey(solemn) : "your mom,pokemons and Misty thats all..oh and yes,you youself"
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "right.but till how long?"
Tracey(solemn) : "yeah,i get you you'll never have anything that's not you"
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "clarity,more clarity"
Tracey(solemn) : "you and Misty,you two are um..like same thing in two different vessels somehow, so you'll always get paired no matter what but one vessel may blindfold ownself and so on but as it's said the pairing and eventual nonseparablity is inevitable,so,that is we unnecessarily was worried
about both you and Misty,while ourselves having to go through the same realizations in our own personal lives and so on..so,now if similarity applied we better keep absolutely off and we
better never say you're her best choice rather saying..um sorry,please Ash..never say you're her
best but only ever choice,the beautiful..no sorry..that chapter never happened,never existed,it was like a mirage..and if we meet him behave like friends till he brings that up himself,then we'll bite.and we don't meet him on purpose by any means,even if one does it must be Gary,cause he never gave him any consideration and Brock is sternly warned if he wishes to talk to you ever again he has to be like this as well though he certainly can meet him on purpose but the other conditions hold,and if somehow something happens or that Misty is intentionally ever mentioned about those phases of her personal life by anybody,then that's it the very first time,you'll tell Misty, you're moving away from here but if that goes beyond may god save us and the whole Cerulian City from insomnia(laugh),and it's no warning or threat it's a statement if we don't agree,or Misty somehow in intentionally reminded by other people and we despite having the power don't do anything,then that too is,basically you don't want any shadow of any dirty hands on your most..no you own self..yeah i get you,if one lea..um..if the one is not getting ever closer to the other in as fast a rate and for that reason the other is a bit unstable,the support cast has to make sure by every means that it keeps well."
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "Greninja,connect...(speaking in Tracey’s mind as Greninja connected by her channels to Marill and Scyther by whom Tracey is connected)..perfect,now another,i wanted my pokemons and so on WHY MY BUDDIES ARE WHO THEY ARE?”
Tracey(solemn) : “because they are your soulmates too eternally with you and viseversa like this very Greninja”..
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : “right,now again,Misty WANTED me?"
Tracey(Ash speaking inside Tracey's Mind) :"um..Ash,she also always had you but she..no,no..um..yeah if we never interfared then she would never had had that illusion of ever
being not getting closer to you at the fastest rate..but you were rude..um,ok..you can solve your own problems but she at first..well later yes right,she was doing your trials as were you and so on..yeah no involvement in personal problems unless purely medical necessaties as long as you’re alive...Misty has always been with you,she's just like that..right and yeah i get you on that,and you don't hold any grudges against me but if something further happens to Misty,that will be my last night(laugh)..um..sorry..that’ll be my last night of any kind of sleep cause whole psychic group will take care of all the rest of the nights in my left over life(bursts into laughter)."
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : "Greninja,disconnect(talking normally)..Trace,what has happend?"
Tracey(sigh) : "Nothing,all this is a play of you two of hide and seek just like you and your pokemons,the results here are mere tokens,beneath them what you are you always are
and so on..Ash,we just want you and Misty to not play any self destructive game just to prove that
absolutely nothing can separate you two or for the fun of it,and this applies especially for you
Ash,stop this,go to Orange with Misty and we won't keep you pre-occupied for long at all, it's just
that please just a very few days,have mercy on us.."
Ash(laugh,closed eyes) : "Trace,Trace,Trace(Tracey shakes his head and sighs)...the Vultures have
only taken a bit of a shock, They're still very much here Trace,i can clearly see their plans,no i won't make you go thoroughly through their planning again but this is the Ultimate, that i COULD'VE done things differently,COULD'VE shown less emotion yesterday,Could've..and so on,that is what is happening and has happened COULD'VE been different,but why is in not?(smile,open eyes) Trace tell me frankly,(closed eyes,smile)the vultures are interrogating that what incentive i've ever given to anyone including Mist to suddenly believe that i was never a playboy(open eyes,smile) AT ALL(closed eyes,smile)?"
Tracey(laugh then smile) : "Ash,you surely don't need to validate yourself on this point and you know it,what you said last night is exactly that and what neither me nor Dase can ever forget,cause you just with this recent characteristic language and antics of yours told us exactly what we the
couples actually feel between us all the time and that so heartfelt thing you just gave as your answer with your antics and still are doing,(laugh) man really what has happened to the boy that i saw 17 years back,showing as if absolutely clueless as to what's happening around him,only ever knowing the goal of freeing himself and his pokemons up from the confinement of being whatever by that he understood and his pokemons(laugh) and the outward cluelessness i later understood was the most cunning veil and the incredible honesty that he representated made either family eternally or mortal enemies who too adores him only if he gives them a chance and he still isn’t sane at all by common knowledge cause all these represent exactly what he so desperately wants to be – a Gengar(bursts into laughter) so he only wanted to be a Gengar and thus his endeavours and outside that he travelled only ever knowing he is with his family and soulmates that’s his bunch or the whole pokemon world as in general and even strangers all were his own and he only ever knew his most dear soulmate his wife for eternity Misty(smile,Ash opens his eyes smiles)..which infact as i now understand none of these were at all the thing,it was only the illusion of you yourself that was there,you were and still very much are just absolutely oblivious to everything and Misty well it's as you meant,you yourself (both smile)"
Ash(smile,closed eyes) : “and the rest the family to most loathed enemy?”
Tracey(smile) : “yeah,all are,Misty the most here and pokemons there where you and Misty to you become same and to my utmost misfortune thus i’ll eternally have Marshadow,Banette,etc pestering me whole life(laugh)..”
Ash(smiles,closed eyes) : "right but the vultures will now easily insinuate that what if i lost Sinnoh,what if Mist never left,what if i truely have bedded roads.. s..(Tracey sighs and shakes his head laughing) and ONLY THEN have realized that they didn't appease me as much as they should have SO ONLY NOW i'm coming back to the old dens(Tracey shakes his head)..no Trace don't shake you head like a female stricken madcap(Tracey laughs) or sigh or try stopping me, answer me,the Vultures will continue the what ifs just after the could'ves.."
Tracey(laugh) : "then the final and the abolute answer is that,what if they never bothered at all to begin with.thats all(bursts into laughter)"
Ash(closed eyes,smile) : “then finally Trace will at least I,need anything ever including my mom my bunch,my Mist,my family..my,my,my,my...do I Trace need anything AT ALL?”
Tracey(smile) : “no unless you’ve a human body and a human mind with a human intelligence and finally with a condition of soul that manifests something we know as human”
Ash(closed eyes,smile) : “why so GREEDY about HUMANS Trace,WHY so GREEDY?”
Tracey(sigh,shaking his head) : “anything that’ll appear through and as ideas and forms and if your soulmate is projected outside you as per your condition,your discourse will come to be perpetually true,else you’ll ever remain single and happy cause you’re soulmate is never projected outside at all,(laugh)which here isn’t the case for any of us and sadly which is the case for your pest this Greninja herself and my only 3 as well(laugh)”
Ash(closed eyes,smile) : “right,so that means all these ideas including our and mine first regarding me,Mist,family,pokemons,etc are totally illusive so then the PLAY that has taken place once here is to be EVER be only WAITING to RETURN with MORE HEART-WRENCHING and (open eyes,broad smile) DANGER?”
Tracey(broad smile) : “i’ll surely walk in there too Ash,with a pencil and a paper to persistently observe my perceptions,that’s for sure,once more,always.”
Ash(open eyes,smile,hugs Tracey and Tracey also hugs Ash a moment later they break hug Ash closes his eyes again,Tracey laughs) : "Right!Trace,perfectly right!so you see Trace,i’ll still call you a dumb jackal(both laugh) with Marshadow to help and Banette to presently reviw(both laugh),but see Trace,the vultures are for only now returning to their nests only for us to go to Cerulian..Cerulian,Cerulian,Cerulian(Tracey laughs)..i would just love to,love to Trace shade this down(Tracey bursts into laughter),(Ash opens his eyes,frowns and scowls)I'll have my ceremony right in the middle of that godforsaken pool in that goddamn Gym named the f.. central battlefield,where those little brats have sucked the life out of my eversweet flower slowly match after match,where my little flower was smacked around like a shuttlecock as those doomsday goblins clapped their hands off,exactly where a certain godforsaken sinister boy scout tried to pull off the once in a million dreams stunt by insinuating that my ever beaming flower was using performance enhancements to get to that f.. Hall of Fame book, exactly on the same place,which was searched by the exact f.. brats who were clapping around when my flower was steady,but now they were searching,searching to tear off the very last petal off from my griefstricken little flower by lebelling her a mental wreck..(closed eyes,smile)Trace,that boy scout was subjected to bonhomie with my Gengeley for an hour before he was taken into the day of the life of a few choised Giratinas at Karapaskar Wetlands right in the own den of the college-showoff Giratina gang(Tracey bursts into laughter)..but still Trace,still i'm hungry..Trace...i'm famished.."
Tracey(laughing) : "Ash,they did the same thing to my flower too,and sadly i don’t want to be at Karapasker at all(both laugh) that too with college-bullies(burst into laughter)..man,no wonder these brats choose you so blindly(both laugh)..so only for this time i agree with your latest rant wholeheartedly"
Ash(smile) : "exactly Trace,you couldn't do it yourself cause you don’t have that kind of temperament you’re too sweet too gentle too personally imbalanced unlike Gary for which he has to overwork as you try to hug-it-out with the pests like school-dropout Muks(Tracey bursts into laughter)..anyway for my flower and all the other three flowers who are now my family,and all of whom were stressed beyond limits by the sinister Cerulian city with its godforsaken gangs of eternal brats..(closed eyes,smile)Trace,i'm starving,make sure when i come back i can have that ceremony there,no not what you think,not that Trace.. that's eventual but what follows-> the ceremony of Vultures,of Cerulian's doomsday lambs..i'll induct them one after another personally picking up,minutely,pick up the most wickedly tasty of those lambs and induct them to the slaughter house of uninsinuabley rigousous trash talking(Tracey laughs uncontrollably) and they'll enjoy it Trace,they’ll enjoy it Trace,they'll have to clap their impending doom otherwise on that godforsaken day,they won't come out of that goddamn building,ever again to show their croocked faces on this world..Trace i'm hungry make sure i can feed on Cerulian brats one day,they want shows,they want to enjoy themselves,they sucked up the Sensational Sisters till the very end but now there'll have a new show,The Sensational Sinisters,where any godforsaken brat,having the audacity to show up
around the Challenger's Identification Centre anytime during 24 hours without 7 league titles
and 631 Kanto badges,except from 11-11:15 daytime,will get mentally and verbally and if they're too interested then physically too by their very own pokemons smacked left and right in every battle illegally and they'll have to enjoy the new badge of utter incompetence that will be bestowed upon them day after day if the godforbidden Cerulian wants a peaceful sleep in the night away from flying Charizards and haunting Gengars in massive herds.Trace, Cerulian is in it's very last month
of exuberance,that they're known for,but after that,may they save themselves.(smile)right
Trace,let's go(recalles all pokemons as does Tracey),no i exactly sensed that mom hasn't started
preparing the lunch so first described 106 minutely to her for 45 minutes and then sent them off thats playboy mastery Trace(both laugh) so nothing has happened here and we just after completing all here go to the Lab to have the Grand Union that's well been 17 long years in making(Tracey laughs)(smile)and i really thought that Daisy,by they way please forgive my audacity,I really thought that Tracey would be too excited and Gary too dumbstruck(Tracey laughs and shakes his head) to do anything but NOT wanting to arrange a party,specifically why he sent you,Daisy to vulture around(Tracey bursts into laughter)here and Gary has sent Lillie to do a certain job for today to see if we weren't going out anywhere,surely then Trace,i'll love to go also now that mom is there
and my antics there yesterday,i only wish Violet could be here but Brock has a little bit left with
me(Tracey shakes his head),so there'll have to be another day as well(Tracey laughs)"
Tracey (laughing) : "be our guest Ash,would you cook?"
Ash(smile) : "with pleasure!"
Tracey(laughing) : "fine but that might be on that later day special for Brock(Ash laughs)lets go."
Ash(laugh) : "just hang on Trace,we'll to Gary’s part 8 hours later(laughes uncontrollably)"
Tracey (flustered) : "um.."
Ash(bursts into laughter,releases Greninja) : "sweet sweet Trace,first we with Greninja on your shoulders will walk to the lab and then take see her off there and take Dragonite and go to somewhere and just tell them now we’re going on around 4 pm,have something there,then going to Viridian Lake at night where Brock will have to be at present even if he’s in heaven or hell(Tracey bursts into laughter) to finish his rounds,the day after tomorrow,morning time i’m leaving Trace,leaving for Pinkenberry(both laugh) on dragons of course(both laugh)  and i'm going with ONLY Mist,Dr.Tracey Skechit and Doctor Brock Slate are strictly prohibited and Dr Tracey Skechit is especially a forbidden substance for any kind of travels in Orange(both bursts into laughter)"
Tracey(laugh) : "you want to show our graveyard plan?(bursts into laughter)"
Ash(smile) : “yes of overworking,by-the-way,according to my orders today a lots of Oak Labs papers are there where i’m taking you and Gary is already there since 7 in the morning when an urgency call reached him with Clarie,Keith and Merv as he already knows why i’m taking you there and being in additional charge of legal department because you’re too personal(Tracey laughs and shakes his head) is with those papers and you in-charge of pokemon department must so be there and all your papers were told to be packed as you’ve done yourself by Professor Oak and we’re going there to pick that up and all are at Gary’s part cause there’s an emergency in your part as declared by me as Muk has got all the 10000 year old papers as well by now(both laugh)...there are may by 100000 papers but don’t worry things will be cleared soon,there’s a billion or more papers there Tracey and Donovan,Billy,Sandra and Amanda all are there and many more,waiting Trace waiting for YOUR arrival..Oh,yes,Professor Oak and Larry too might be there by now..”
Tracey(frown) : “that farm..”
Ash(smile,pats Tracey) : "no Trace save it,just a SURPRIZE,a surprize Trace that will start the next chapter of all our lives..PLAYBOY RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF  FAMILY(BOTH LAUGH)..(closed eyes,smile,Tracey laughs)..seeing the days through bright and pale(Tracey laughs),sowing the sketch through tooth and nail(Tracey claps),rowing in future so why to sail(both smile),so Trace let’s march (open eyes,scowl,growl)UNTO THE HELL(Tracey bursts into laughter as does Ash and they hug each other)...atleast i wasn’t sleeping entirely for 4 years then?(both burst into laughter)..let’s Buzz then,eat,only-sleep,wake-up,repeat(both burst into even more laughter).."

.......................................

and Pikachu just kept staring at you and looking at
me and was very excited and was saying a single
thing consistently,he you know understands me as
well as anybody and he himself was happy to see
you again after a very long time and he was
always on my shoulder the moment during
breakup we last saw each other,he doesn't
understand these things the way we know,hisworldview is totally different than ours,but
probably he must've felt something as we didn't
call and all that,so he was happy and pointing to
your picture in a low voice started constantly
saying one word "Pikachupi!Pikachupi!Pikachupi"
his word for "MISTY"..and i just felt like i was
looking at something so familiar yet so far as if i
was touching something kept in front of me yet
the touch felt like as if it's lives million lives
apart..as if i knew somehow a million years ago in
a live many many lives ago and shared some
memories that were so precious that i just
couldn't move after all these many years later
despite my internal bliss it was only covering a
darkness that i'm touching something long
gone..and Pikachupi flet like warm breeze hitting
my face constantly, without ceasing,and tears
automatically rolled down my cheeks..and(bit
choked)..it was then i first had a glimpse of what
you really are to me..there it actually felt like it's
only me million lifes ago yet so far away and it'sas if just another type of body that i had and i've
ever so longed for a grand union again and it
wasn't like looking at your own 5 year old picture,it
was something way way stronger than anything i
ever have heard,read,seen or experienced that i
can relate to..it was so natural..i forgot actually i
can't really describe what i did see but i didn't see
flesh and blood at all there as by then it i had
become habituated to by analysis and no i didn't
even remember any good things that you may've
ever done to me or who you were etc,Pikachu's
words and this picture had given me the
realization that i never imagined,i just realized as if
someone firmly but gently speaking in my head in
my own voice- "MISTY-that's your soul,you are that
as well and the difference you're making is only
your illusion,you are Misty and Misty is you,no
difference is there,see it for yourself"..and I don't
know how long i stood there or i just didn't want to
part..here here here..
Misty(deep sigh) : "Ash, you're also a DisasterMaster!why break this moment up?i was seeing
that as well.."
Ash(bit puzzled) : "um..sorry..but(laugh)..i just
realized now that if then,exactly then some vulture
dared to be around and this is another God's
Grace that they didn't,but if they did and disturbed
me or gave the scene to the press,i would've been
very happy to set at that very moment all of my
pokemons on the vulture if i was even remotely
disturbed then or my moment went public,but God
didn't let that happen out of the infinite
compassion,so some vultures were saved and
No,Mist really,if i didn't get you due to some
vulture then disturbing me,my name would've
been written with blood then and there and i knew
nobody present in that building,Lance included
could do anything about me or my pokemons
actions and it wouldn't have been nice and i
would've become a real nerve wreck then as i
would've tried to push my pokemons to absolute
ultimate,killing them and myself in theprocess..now so hopefully vultures showed some
intelligence there and saved their godforsaken
lives and MINE as well..anyhow..vulture is a good
name i.."
Misty(frown) : "Ash,i would like that the infinite
compassion be helpful to you in restraining me
from smacking you the next time you suddenly
drag vultures in a most beautiful scene,continue
now"
Ash(laugh) : "alright,alright,so the vultur..um,no
don't do that(Misty lightly smacks Ash's head),its
ok(laugh),so sweet,nostalgia(Misty laughs and
again smacks a bit forcefully)..um..ok do that
always but gently..(both bursts into laughter)"
Misty(sigh) : "Ash,please you.."
Ash(smile) : "ok,ok,bare with me,i'm just back,so i
was in this trace like state and then i was brought
back to my senses by a Gentle hand on my
shoulders..it was Lance,and i also recognised hat
Pikachu had long stopped uttering your name and
was constantly looking at me,so i just suddenlywas brought back to my senses and looking at
Lance was just startled and didn't know what to
say,in the mean time Noivern had put the picture
back and is now standing beside me,i called him
back but i had no words at all in my head,then
Lance very gently broke the silence saying,that he
knew Professor Oak as well as and knew me for
ages,in his words->
Lance : "Ash! you alright?"
Ash(stuttering) : "um..it's all right..i just..um.."
Lance(kind face) : "Lost in thoughts?"
Ash(thoughtfull) : "yeah i guess"
Lance : "Ash you've been standing like this for 10
minutes at least as i've entered here and was just
observing you and i left you here 15 minutes
ago,so it must be 25 minutes then or there
about.Ash, the tears"
and then i suddenly realized i cried a bit and
quickly wiped off the tears and
Ash : "um..no it's alright Lance..i just.."
Lance : "Ash, it's alright,i know her well,Misty wasyour constant travel companion for 5 long years
and then she came to Cerulian Gym and did
brilliantly and she was also.."
I don't know Mist,but suddenly these past tense
words - "was,came,did,was"..became unbearable
to me and i burst out in a bit of choked but high
pitched voice
Ash(bit choked,bit high pitched) : "Please,enough!"
Lance : "Ash.."
Ash : "um..sorry..but she's still alive and it just felt
a bit..um..well.. awkward,anyhow um..sorry for
shouting at you Lance..i'm terrib.."
Lance : "Ash,it's all right,you were wanting to know
more about Misty right?"
Ash : "Lance it's ok..i'll just ask someone else..your
responsibilities.."
Lance(firmly shrugging off) : "Ash,i know my
responsibilities and restrictions,i can tell you
about Misty Waterflower from Cerulian City Gym
and Frontier symbol all that i reliably and
personally know,but you must stay here tonight aswe have to finish with this,you've been absent
from the dinner for too long,you must comply with
me"..
see i took the chance because..please this is just
jokingly..i politely asked Lance if i could mouth the
press off and if i sweared mag he spare me,Lance
smiled and said that he himself will get rid of the
press and will finish the night as quickly as
possible and besides not much was left of
it..so,anyhow i couldn't thrash the vultures then
and there for for their campaign to ruin my
personal life and so again Lance saved himself
and vultures..thus it happened.."
Misty : "um..Ash,we better go and eat something"
Ash : wait just a bit..
........
Ash : "so,as i was saying,then i just returned to
your picture and Noivern kept holding it and i kept
gazing at you,i did it just to recreate the moment
and Lance obliged"
Misty(blush a bit) : "um..Ash,i may again have toface Lance very soon.."
Ash(smile) : "na,it's alright with him, your like his
second daughter or even much younger i guess,
it's alright,but here you must bear with me again
as i want to contrast the reasons why other people
thought we're made for each other"
Misty(smile) : "ya,i would."
Ash(smile) : "alright,Lance told me as i was again
tendering the picture,that what you were upto with
your activities and overwork, suddenly turning on
the Frontier Symbol for pestering you and then
creating legal skirmish,besides if that brat is ever
seen again at Cerulian or anywhere in the world, i
would also like to battle him,but unlike you,i'll do it
illegally.."
Misty : "yes Ash,i had to,he was pestering me first
due to my name and fame and all that,then when
he got a rude awakening there he started name
calling and dragging my friends and family into it
and doing all that,so i had to take actions as all my
sisters supported me and we got rid of him fromthere and while busting we we found out he was
using illegal performance enhancers and all
that,so his water pokemons were added to
me,others went to different labs,well Gary
managed to take the 90% actually..haha..he was
extending the lab then so he began and actually it
was a good advertisement as well...anyhow that
was almost two years ago but you can continue
now"
Ash(tendering Misty's cheeks) : "No Mist,i
shouldn't have left you just like that,anyhow..lets
reminisce,so Lance told the stories and all about
you and your recent problems,i almost instantly
knew that you actually was only longing to see me
and were entrapped in a golden cage with the
huge responsibility of polishing it everyday,so you
finally resorted to your pokemons and gym and
frontier and all else and it did get you in Hall of
Fame but you weren't all right..by the way Green
met me in Johto Elite 4,my first,and was trying to
imply that i was needed near my hometown evenbefore i got started saying that when would i go to
Kanto Elite 4,cause the Elite 4 will retire and all
that and yeah he did you a real friend's favour by
trying to approach me,as soon as he extracted my
news from Brock,but as soon as i asked him from
where he was from and why so much sympathy
from Lance suddenly,and then i held him up and
rang Lance and so that he wasn't the messenger
was proved,and i just politely asked him that why
was he so desperate himself being a good enough
Pokemon trainer having won Orange League,and
he stammered a bit and then i pressed him for his
hometown address,he had to admit that he was
from Cerulian,as soon as i heard that name i told
him there's no need to pull such stunts on me i've
not yet won a singke Elite 4,winning only 6 leagues
and threatened him that if he pesters me further,i'll
personally love to battle him and snatch away is
Orange League trophy cause mine just got a bit
lonely and i'll do all this by means of pokemon
battling,to which he cringed but still being aLeague Champion he felt humiliated and just
afreed to battle me,but said i would only after the
Elite 4 match and forced him to stay and
watch,and i did have a great match fortunately
and the Elite 4 himself recognized my abilities,so
Green got a bit awestruck but was still willing to
battle,and i have big respect for him as he
reminded me of myself but just before we started
i trash talked him in the press without naming
which got him angry and he was about to get
physically involved with me,then i told him
personally that listen mate,just tell me the reason
for your desparation and obsession with me i feel
physically threatened compelling me to take legal
actions against him,to which he was infuriated
and said to look up who he was which is from
there his things were known and then he was still
saying things to which i said just spit it out,and he
said that i mingled with his girlfriend,but as soon
as he said that i myself told him if she was still
you girlfriend and has been with me just forget herand save himself and that its not my fault that
people like him would throw themselves at my
door..which rather pushed him back.then the
press created a fuss but i suppressed his name
and got it changed so he had been greatful to me
and just shook my hands and left,but he made me
more screwed up after the Serena fiasco months
apart and i said well this can be fun,and just about
truly started my antics.."
Misty(sigh) : "Ash,i did know Green went to you but
i didn't know he pestered around like that,(smile
and frown)we'll have to answer many people at
Cerulian..
Ash(irritated) :
"Cerulian!Cerulian,Cerulian,Cerulian! except for my
flower there's nothing good there and just last
night they proved me righg again,and my flower
was accidentally there,it could've been Viridian,it
could've been Venus as well,Cerulian"
Misty(laugh) : "sorry Ash,but i just love it how you
hate my hometown with a particular passion,butyou never did before"
Ash(irritated) : "no cause i didn't fully comprehend
my cherished flower and thought it would be just
like any City,but since then and especially since i
now know their infatuation with Sensational
Sisters and that Gym,that was your sweat and
tears and took it for granted,I can't but be
delighted now to go there and perform,and no
even last evening i wasn't bothered but then they
created a fuss there in the shop,they owe a big
performance from me and it'll be in the local press
where i finally will get my hands at precious
Cerulian f.. sorry"
Misty(laugh) : "anyway it's my hometown,just
spare it a thought before you reign havoc there"
Ash(smile) : "sorry Mist,but on this one i can't give
you any guarantees but as i'll have to also be in
that godforsaken place myself i'll spare the
Gym..you'll know that i praised the leader to
heaven and demoted the support cast at the same
Gym to hell,and i'll spare this gym.."Misty : "much appreciated,now continue"
Ash(smile) : "yes,then Lance told me that Misty
Waterflower is a famous name throughout Kanto
and other places may be as well and that my
teenage travel companion Misty and Misty
Waterflower,Cerulian Gym leader were two very
different persons as if i didn't know it already,he i
guess thought i had a teenage crush kinda thing
rekindled and probably didn't forget her and due to
your condition he thought if he could help(laugh)..
I don't get this infatuation of people not letting a
person be happy AND single.."
Misty(solemn) : "Ash,i wasn't happy at all,that was
the whole reason things started"
Ash : "yeah a mess that almost defeated me had it
not been for that day there..anyhow,he went on
and told me about your present state a bit and
then said i'll agree that i'll help,to which i said
indeed if such is the case i'll be very happy to help
my long lost dear friend,which he also agreed but
then despite knowing my abilities tried to advisedme that you have picked up a bit of a bad name
and they suspect you might soon get your hands
dirty with illegal business,as soon as he said
illegal,i scoffed that i helped busting team rocket
and i've had enough experience with illegal things
which he said he just cautioned me because he
thought i liked that picture but i might get a rude
awakening,i politely said if he gives me protection
i'll do my maximum but i said please i don't want
to hear a word more on the past,present or future
Misty Waterflower and I don't like anybody telling
me anything about my childhood friends no
matter what they've become now..so then i set
things up with Lance,came out for the first week
gauged whether i really wanted it or not,then once
i knew the answer is yes,the next two weeks i
planned on what i shall do contancted my family
and all that,but the biggest thing was my infighting
and once i won that just the night before i
handcupped you(smile,holding Misty's hands and
immitating),from then on i knew i've got you back50%,full from my part,and the rest depends upon
you..so yes, that's how i came back.."
Misty(clap and smile) : "Bravo,no first you saved
me second we married third we had to pass a
sleepless first night due to hoot-hoots..(laugh)"
Ash(laugh) : "see vulture is a better word"
Misty(smirk) : "Its vulpic,only that you're not
allowed to use it"
Ash(smile) : "right(phone rings Serena),right
Vulture Time(shows phone,bursts into
laughter,Misty shakes her head again with a
faintand Pikachu just kept staring at you and
looking at me..and i smile)
Ash: "No Mist,go help Mom or take rest here,i'm
talking all day since yesterday noon,let me get
this,later if she wants you can"
Misty(tendering Ash's cheeks) : "don't take too
much strain, she's a mere kid"
Ash(smile) : "ok,hellow,Serena,how may i come
into your service?"
Serena : "um..Ash,i just thought as you saidy esterday.."
Ash(sternly) : "you're in Unova,it's night there and
you should be either sleeping or studying or
training,why are you in my room?"
Serena : "um..just wanted to know?"
Ash : "if she ever liked the shape of the ring and.."
Serena(sternly) : "Ash,this is too much, you're
mar.."
Ash(sternly) : "MARRIED TO MISTY
KETCHUM,record it and make it your alarm tone"
Serena(dissapointed) : "i called you to say i'm
going to have my 4th Gym battle day after
tomorrow.."
Ash(irritated) : "You have about 5000 people there
who've spent their entire god damn lives exactly
around where your staying now,but i would know
more than them?from here?"
Serena : "just give Misty the phone,none can talk
with you.."
Ash(laugh) : "including?"
Serena(screem) : "hey don't get me started ok,ialso need advise on..um.."
Ash : "Boyfriends?"
Serena(hesitant) : "um..yes"
Ash(laugh) : "that you wanted Sam but Sam is all
over..?"
Serena(iritated) : "hey stop that, that's none of your
business,just i want to congratulate you and Misty
and also tell you that this perfectly makes me
happy as this erases off my mistake entirely and
from now on i'll not need to call you.THANK YOU"
Ash(laugh) : "yeah bye!(angry) Little godforsaken
brats.."
.....(Misty and Delia downstairs)...
Delia : "dear,you look a bit worn out.."
Misty(smile) : "um..no just too much talking,i'm
habituated though Gyms are hard places.."
Delia(points out Misty's ring) : "so happy,Mist,your
officially Ketchum now.."
Misty(giggle) : "thanks Mom.."
Delia : "did he fetch that before.."
Misty(bit ashamed) : "yes,Mom that's what he did"Delia(bit concerned) : "he has changed quite a bit
in these 3 years,his language also isn't very polite i
can sense.."
Misty(nervously) : "um..yeah a bit rough..he's just
a bit tired but won't stop working"
Delia(concerned) : "well,he surely knows how to
scare people"
Misty(smile) : "that i have to agree with"
Delia(smile) : "Mist,when are you going out today?"
Misty : "um..you mean date?"
Delia(smile) : "right."
Misty(nervously) : "well..we had yesterday but
today..well..um..weaven't decided on that yet.."
Delia(frown) : "Mist,is everything all right,you can
and infact should be frank you know.."
Misty(laugh) : "i'm sorry mom for laughing,but
don't worry at all,he's as sweet as ever,just a bit
tired,you know the press hasn't been kind to
him,so he still just thinks that he has to logically
validate every moment of his life and give his
analysis or the result of it to anyone concerned in a rather colourful way that in his mind will give the
press a good beat-down"
Delia(smile and concerned) : "i see,no my little Ash
never could do anybody any harm but i guess you
should get this trash talking checked,it's not at all
good"
Misty(smile) : "i'm being right at it but it'll take
time,he had just been living a lonely life,it'll just
take him some time to come into terms with his
new surroundings"
Delia(smile) : "but enough about him,how are
you,my little doll?"
Misty(giggle) : "fine mom,just fine"
Delia(looking at Misty's ring holding her hand) :
"very beautiful.but Mist,you should take rest as
well,you youself weren't in a good health and
much emotion overnight.."
Misty(smile) : "i'm fine mom,i've had too many
sleepless nights because of the Gym and other
things,i'm habituated like that for the past 12
years,rather last night was the best sleeplessnight till date"
Delia(smile) : "happy to know my little doll,but
um..Ash might also not be prepared to take you
out for a dinner because he thinks that the press.."
Misty(laugh) : "um..sorry for laughing mom,but it's
just the effects of his antics throughout the
night..i've been entertained beyond
imagination,but no he has refused to take me out
on a date or to dance or giving me a flower
bouquet-refusal in all accounts"
Delia(very concerned) : "my God!..what's the
matter.."
Misty(laughing) : "he would rather run away with
me to unknown destinations"
Delia(smile) : "too much imagination(Misty bursts
into laughter),besides Mist,he's fine at home."
Misty(smile) : "mom,its just that press bug that's
bitten him for such a long time and to such an
extent,he just can't yet get over it,so thats his
definition of complete solitude"
Ash(outside) : "Mom,food,and overwork that little Mimey of yours, don't let my Mist work at
all,she's...um,i just want her with me here right
now and all the time"
Delia(smile) : "also my Mist too, remember that(Misty laughs),and leave Mimey alone"
Ash(irritated) : "mom,please,but,if you don't allow me to um..well..gaze at my Mist all i want,then i'll get Mime to batlle,there you little brat.."
Delia(frown) : "Ash, that's impolite,and leave Mimey right now."
Ash(wrestling with Mime,comes near) : "Mime is pestering me ever since..why you little brat, you're no good for..mom where's my food"
Misty(surprized) : "where are you going?"
Delia( taking Mime away,scowl&frown) : "Ash wait there in the table,Mist will take both of your
foods,and don't runaway with Mist so quickly(laugh)"
Ash(dissapointed) : "yeah,so you've also decided that i should be away from Mist.."
Delia(frown,comes to Ash) : "what's wrong withyou honey?calm down, your always too agitated,too active all the time,Mist is coming,let her prepare the dishes.."
Ash(irritated,sitting) : "Mist come quickly,and why can't Mime prepare the dishes and no i'm a bit
excited and yes,i'm going to the farm."
Delia(frown) : "Ash,just wait here be calm honey,i've got to ask you something"
Misty (comes with dishes) : "here are the..(Ash tries to take off the dishes and hug Misty) Ash,what are you.."
Delia(frown) : "Ash.."
Ash(hugging Misty) : "ah! that's what i wanted,no a bit later.."
Misty(scoffs) : "Ash,mom is here its rude!"
Ash(hugging Misty) : "no if you hug me back,i'll not say a thing while i'm at the table,you’re my wife for 16 years and for 19 my Mist, it’s not a vulger st.."
Misty(hugging Ash quickly,then scoffing) : "that's it.Ash,are you out of your mind?calm down,don't
make a fuss"
Ash(sitting down) : "no i'm done,will eat very slowly and sorry mom and Silence"
Delia(frown) : "Misty,just sit down honey"
Misty(bit concerned) : "yeah,just these things.."
(finally everyone sists down)
Delia(observing Ash) "Mist,can you tell me something,I don't know much about training and
battling but i do know Mimey more than anyone,what is wrong with Ash?"
Ash(scowl) : "Mom your not insin..um,sorry suggesting that.."
Misty(angry,shouts) : "Ash!just eat silently!"
Delia(very concerned) : "Mist,please,why is he behaving like this,and no it's not just now since the
day he has returned,he's been like that,Mimey's too excited all the time and wants to play around
so does Ganger and those two,Pikachu seems pretty indifferent to Ash,what is it?these Dark
Types aren't good Ash,you know.."
Misty(smile) : "Mom,please calm down i'll explain everything..no Ash,not you and you're not leavingtill i'm finished,Pikachupi,come to Misty,baby(Pikachu junps to Misty),right,and No
Ash you're staying silent"
Delia(bit shivering voice) : "Mist.."
Misty(smile) : "Mom,we don't have anything to hide from you but it's a kind of a trade secret..he's
an once only living legend in Pokemons Training and hence he's so important to the world.."
Ash(scoff) : "Mist is in.."
Misty(frown) : "Ash"
Ash(grim) : "very well,but mention yourself,she doesn't know.."
Misty(frowns at Ash,back to Delia,smiling) : "Mom,he has unfathomable powers over Pokemons, especially on his own ones,and even in general that aren't his,he can instantly gauge them and if he so wants get attuned to their nerves and the whole combination then becomes very absoluty invincible in battling,and those like Mime,who've been with him for 16 years,and you know Mime too is a Psychic type thus can be extremely powerful if she wants to be-but just like
she and Ganger,Sableye and rest,Ash's nerve's state affects them a bit...they always are too
playful..."
Delia(concerned) : "um..Mist,that doesn't seem to
be a very good thing,is it like an obsession?"
Misty(smile) : "exactly the opposite,Ash's own
nature is getting reflected in Mime and all
them,Pikachu is an exception due to his own
temperament and he can't be automatically
affected just by Ash's presence,he has to be
warmed up,so he's indifferent it seems and he's
also able to catch Ash's nerve states,he's just
irritated with him that he's always playfull and not
battling anymore..see mom i myself have two
such pokemon,one Golduck and a Gyarados and i
can affect pokemons too but they won't show
visible characteristics like this because my
temperament is different to Ash and so are our
pokemons,i'll show you Golduck later,but that's my
own bunch and on opposite side i can affect thembut it's very limited and difficult...Ash's level is
impossible to gauge..but this thing is there for
trainers that can affect opposite pokemons and
it's just trade secret as we call it, it's very seleted
people in this world can do this successfully and
this power might be abused as well thus the
secrecy but the trainers at this level if comes
naturally,like Ash had automatically comes to
know this a long time ago and now it's absolutely
natural to him,infact now this Pikachu alone is
enough to mat some 120 other Pikachus who've
won 4 leagues and and 70 Pikachus who have
won 6 or 7,like Ash has,Pikachu can alone face the
whole Elite 4 and their Pikachus at one time and
still will just laugh them off if he is focused
enough,and Ash's level is once only,none ever has
went there and Ash is 32 and only growing by
manifolds by day,he can hold sway over his
opponents at mere will no matter who they
are,there can be other pokemon trainers who has
a special power over only his or one specific typeof pokemons but Ash can do it to anybody and
even laugh off legendaries,given he's mind is
focused and he wants to face them,if Ash wishes
he can tame Legendary Pokemons for some times
and even after that phase,but i would actually
claim,though he won't but no it's not my bragging
but a true fact that with his practices and all,Ash is
unmatched in terms of Mastery over Pokemons
given he is focused and ready with a clear mind
that really wants to battle or Master over a
pokemon and that's why he's so sought after,
simply put there's have never been anyone ever
like him(beams and blushes,Delia smiles but a bit
flustered)"
Ash : "and Mist is.."
Misty(frown) : "Ash,please,just stay silent"
Delia(bit flustered) : "um..well..i see...his dad
always had this dream now he has done it..but he
must be lonely.."
Ash(bursting into laughter) : "mom,mom,mom,of
course i was lonely and hence my troubles,but i'mno more and yes i feel too lonely especially if I
can't hug my Mist all I want,if so then i'll become
more playfull and so would Mimey and she'll then
go to battles,so you see i have a deal.."
Misty(frown) : "Ash,stop that, don't talk like this
with mom"
Ash(grim) : "but..i'm not harm.."
Delia(smile) : "no honey,you never can harm but
are you not going to obey your mommy because
your all powerfull now?"
Ash(blush,solemn) : "mom,what the..?you know
what i'm.."
Delia(smile) : "absolutely honey,i do,just remember
that press will not be after you unless you wish
them too and even if the press is around you,you
still don't have to give rigourous motives behind
your each actions get it?
Ash(grim, dissapointed) : "yes mom."
Delia(smile) : "are you dissapointed with that?"
Ash(beaming) : "nope."
Delia(smile) : "that's my sweet boy.by the way,andno not you Ash cause you won't have any control
over your language is you're excited in this
state,Mist will herself briefly say about her
success with Pokemons"
Ash : "huh! then basically i should.."
Misty and Delia unison(smile) :"no, silence"
Ash(grim) : "fine"
Misty(smile) : "um,mom i've also been accepted
into Water Gym Leader's hall of fame and like him
i'm also among the top.."
Ash : "THE TOPPEST"
Misty(frown) : "Ash, didn't we agree that you'll be
silent?"
Delia(sternly) : "Ash,just.shut.up. say Mist"
Misty(laugh): "um..sorry mom..yeah,i'm also
among the top water Pokemon trainers and Gym
leaders"
Ash(whinning) : no i'll interrupt every time,she IS
THE,no please Mist,bear with me,please.."
Delia(smile) : "ok Mist,i'll bear with his
language,besides i must know what my little dollhas done too,please Mist,this time, let's just bear
with him together,but Ash,if you cross the line,i'll
not listen to you"
Ash(sticking his toungue out to Misty) : "yeah!"
(everyone bursts into laughter)
Ash(smile) : "Mist is THE TOPMOST water
pokemon gym leader in THE world but may be
not,i'm having to say may be because else the
vultures will insinuate that(Delia and Misty shake
their heads)(smiling) yeah, that's my
eloquence(Delia,Misty both laugh)...anyhow,the
vultures will insinuate that there are 7 regions in
this world where things are vastly
different,Cerulian,a name that i'm not fond of at all
except when it's associated with my flower(Delia a
bit puzzled,then smiles,Misty blushes),
(smile)that's the name(Delia laughs and pats
Misty,Misty blushes) being a seaside city,its kinda
easy,kinda natural,kinda understandable,kinda
taken for granted that the Gym,if there is one,will
be a Water Pokemon gym and if Pallet had a waterpokemon Gym then suddenly to the vultures it
becomes a problem that because the Geography
is different,so is the Pokemon and so the trainers
are a bit different,but i've been everywhere,i've
never seen a 18 year old kid being able to handle a
Gyarados to the extend where she made it like
Mime is to you mom,at the age of 18 and her
Gyarados could use flamethrower as good as my
Charizard could and you know him,i still can't beat
her Gyarados one on one and she had all the
power over it at the age of 18,and on that day if
she challenged me,all of my then present
pokemons would've lost not even making
Gyarados a bit tired and i had 4 or something that
day,excluding Pikachu,and Pikachu doesn't battle
Mist,even if i kill him he still won't and no that day
he too would've been laughes off by Mist and
Gyarados and the only time i could pursuade my
chu-bro to was when he rather kinda a did a fake
fight,this is when i took my flower here to me from
the godforsaken(Misty&Deliafrowns)..sorry..Cerulian vultures who yesterday
had the audacity to inply to me that i've abducted
their flower..MIST is MY FLOWER ONLY(Misty
blushes and scowls and frowns,Delia smiles and
pats Misty),but the touble is that they would rather
clap her to death than to help her to stand and
then they.."
Delia(sigh) : "Ash, it's about Mist,not your vultures"
(Misty shakes her head)
Ash(smile) : "right,my dear sweet flower can push
her Gyarados now to a level which she told you
about and then this Gyarados isn't her strongest
Pokemon at all,it is Golduck and Dewgong and
Starmie,who she had at like 1 year birthday
present.."
Misty(laugh) : "5"
Ash(smile) : "right,5 year present,and there are
many more,so the vultures finally had to budge
else they would've abjectly humiliated themselves
but the hallowed Cerulian City for the love of God
never bothered,they wanted more and more andeveryday every hour there would be this damn
arrogant brat who'd challenge only to show that he
was a failure as a celebrated boy scout or girl
cheerleader(Delia and Misty
frowns)..anyhow..stup...alright(both laughs).. but
my flower still had to appease those brats by
giving them a badge and fighting them,this badge
they got will be the only in their god damn lives
and thus my flower was getting drained more and
more mentally and physically and the all caring
Cerulian might was doing was to cheer her slow
death...so.."
Delia(solemn) : "Mist,i heard you weren't well,but
this really was too much.."
Misty(smile) : "mom,i'm now very well and no had
he been there at this form of his,i wouldn't have
needed to work or perform at all,money would've
poured into the Gym simply by this rate of trash
talk even with his wife and mother,long live the
vultures Ash,really"
(Misty and Delia bursts into laughter)Ash(smile) : "good break,thanks for the
refreshments Mist,and this will be long
(Misty and Delia again bursts into laughter)..then
there was the king of brats in the neighbouring
Frontier Symbol,which i'm just too tired to explain
but mom remember the job offer that i rejected ?
this is this Battle Frontier's gym.anyhow this brat
conspiring with our well known Cerulian all-
knowers,tried to totally destroy my little flower
there but then as i've told you,my flower is once
only and so she can just deximate any goddamn
weed pretending to be trees without just like an
wink,and so this frontier Symbol had to be out
over my flower cause the conspiring Elite4
thought that would be moral,which she barely was
able to manage,it's like two gyms in one building
and you can understand the workload that my
flower had to bear alone and then the Cerulian
brats came up with a new plan,they were
sending..Mist this will become personal"
Misty(grim) : "Ash, just give it a break,would you?"Delia(concerned) : "what did they do to her Ash?"
Ash(solemn) : "Mist, you're seeing my moods but
mom needs to know,she has an idea about both of
us, especially you,though..."
Delia(scoff) : "Ash,are you.."
Misty(sigh) : "not again,Ash,i'm not going to listen
(hugs Delia)"
Ash(solemn) : "Mom,you've taught me to be
honest with myself first,you want that today?"
Delia(frown) : "i understand,yes,Mime, don't allow
anyone in at any cost no matter who,you too
Pikachu just protech the house(both leave)"
Ash : "and hold onto your daughter and cajole
her,i've caused her what pain i'll tell you now"
Delia(concerned, hugging Misty) : "i see,no dear
please,your with your mom"
Misty : "mom..just tell him to say it as a
comedy,he's been repeating this throughout the
night..(hugging Delia)"
Delia(scowl at Ash,hugging Misty) :"Ash you've
just heard her,and i order you now make it asbearable as possible,and my dear Mist,i'm telling
Ash that if he repeats it again,then he'll not.."
Ash : "MOM,i got you.it'll be so Mom,just hold onto
her"
Delia(scowl) : "Ash start and don't cross any limit"
Ash : "as you say,mom.right,Mom you know about
Serena and you also know i was kissed
accidentally in public,these were accidents and
before them there was one and that was the first
for us both me and Mist that was the only time i
did that on my own wish and her wish also
matched mine.Mist fell for me almost from the
first sight and you know all of it,but..this is funny
Mist..then the vultures started to peek around me
especially after the Sinnoh Miracle,as you know
and no i didn't cheat on her but my ego swelled a
bit too much and eventually we separated,the real
fun starts now,so the Cerulian brats came up with
a particular plan that now since my flower was a
bit depressed and alone,these would circulate
over and you know mom,the irony is that i wasn'tthere at all,i was in heaven,well according to
vultures,anyhow,both she and me were tortured
beyond measures by the vultures and they were
circling around me as well,we took the same
measure in different froms,she continued to
withdraw herself,i continued to attack them..the
only thing was that i was moving around so i in a
way was in a much more favourable
condition,which um well.. helped me to anticipate
if anybody wanted to fall for me,and to cut the
long story short,you're seeing that except for my
flower none did.and she has been hearing me spit
this out to whoever that dared to challenge me
and my flower yesterday,got thrown at mercilessly
by me,but it hurts her,no only Daisy,Tracey and
Brock got this, they're all family,so it's not that the
vultures can do anything about or with it.but she
still agreed to go through that again just now after
going completely sleepless last night,because i
told her to bear with me and i told her i don't hide
anything from my mom,so she's bearing it nowand will so too if i tell the same to the vultures no
matter the consequences and she will do it
because i'm cherished to her and there's no other
reason at all.that's exactly what she was doing
when Cerulian brats were hovering around and my
sweet flower couldn't take it anymore shut herself
up in her room and only attending to pokemon and
all was actually dying slowly,as she was taking
(),cause she couldn't bear my separation which is
why i went to doctor with her yesterday first thing
in Safford,but as soon as i returned to her you can
see the result and i've not been and not being kind
to her either..so if you ever had anything that the
vultures told you about me believe all of it and
more,but as far as your daughter goes,you can as
well treat it as a bad dream.i don't need to tell you
whether i reciprocate my flowers feeling for me to
her or not,and thus the all conquering Cerulian
brats and their master the vultures just abjectly
failed in another endeavour.but they'll be at it
again but the only thing is that next time i'll bethere and i..anyhow, that's the story"
Delia(tendering Misty's head) : "good enough
Ash,but this is the last time you said this and if it's
not then.."
Misty(raising her head from the table,with a bit of
tear) : "mom, that's Ash's power i was talking
about(a bit shivering voice)am i wrong Ash?"
Ash : "no,you're not Mist!"
Delia(tendering Misty) : "ok let's leave and let him
entertain his vultures all he wants"
Ash(laugh) : "mom,please i'll leave ,only if I can
hug my flower once more,um twice..um thrice..
Delia(tendering Misty) : "do it as many times,but.."
Ash(sigh) : "my power is that i'll trash talk people
and tell them such bare truths that the honesty of
me will connect with them and their pokemons if
pokemons are involved,and then if i want i can
extract any secret i want and in the battle it'll
mean if you had Mimey and i came without any
pokemons,100 such Mime's won't cop with me
cause they'll want to play with me all the time andbe my pokemon rather so what to speak if i have
84 pokemons myself? thus i can make people tell
the absolute truth cause i had to face it from close
stare and this'll be if able to help you,you good,if
not my bad.Mist has the same powers but her
temperaments is different so she can never do
what i'm upto,and those who think water pokemon
trainers cant handle electeic types they may test
Pikachu with Mist and that'll be their last sane day
here..anyhow..i know many more things but my
only weapon is that and you already know it as do
Pikachu,Mime and so on,i took my flower through
it,and my flower follows me no matter what i do to
her so i had to pick her up from the godforsaken
Cerulian City's goddamn Gym and now has put
here at my home.this is where i live,my flower now
is my family.the end."
Delia(smile) : "i get you,but your process is only
good for vultures,and yes hug Mist now"
Ash(smile) : "right.(hugging Misty) there there
Mist,you want to hear the flower song again nowhich was mine not Cerulian"
Misty(blush,hugging Ash quickly) : "later"
...(Mr Mime comes in)..
Delia(frown) : "Mimey who is it? didn't i tell you
none allowed?"
Mr Mime :
Ash(irritated) : "Tracey!Tracey,Tracey,Tracey,Tracey,i'm
killing him today,Pikachu thunder chair.."
Delia(concerned) : "Ash.."
Misty(smile) : "Mom,he has to mean it..."
...(Pikachu doesn't allow Tracey to enter)...
Tracey : "um..Ash.."
Ash(hugging Misty) : "i'm busy with Mist,get off or
else.."
Tracey : "Ash,please it's Golduck"
Misty : "um..Ash i should go.."
Ash : "i'm going too"
Delia(concerned) : "don't hit him"
Ash : "don't send Mime,i'll hit both then"
Delia(self) : "nah!had it not been for Mist,he
would've gone mad completely(smile) that'sactually what he is expressing to Mist..(pooe
boy).."
.....(outside)...
Misty(talkes Golduck) : "thanks Trace.(leaves)"
Tracey : "Mi.."
Ash : "hey you en.. don't call my wife, don't talk
with her,don't pester her, don't come near her,dont
look at her,don't.."
Tracey(laughing) : "Ash,man you need rest.."
Ash(laugh) : "i need rest?"
Tracey : "um..ok,i get it but you're only making it
more and more.."
Ash(scowl,smile) : "sweet sweet Trace,tell me why
is it that the vultures are around here?"
Tracey : "um..i'm leaving..(trying to flee) "
Ash(releases Noivern) : "right Trace stand in front
of me,yeah here(recalls Noivern,Pikachu jumps
onto Ash's lap)see Pikachu doesn't exactly like
you..so it's better that you comply"
Tracey : "this is pure blackmailing.."
Ash(angry) : "you f.. brat,shut the f.. up.who called me in the middle of the night to torture my already
stressed sweet flower even more.."
Tracey (smile) : "Ash,Misty will forgive me but you
were.."
Ash(extremely angry) : "DON.UTTER.MY.WIFE’S.NAME and so when are you releasing
my speech to international aud.."
Tracey(grim) : "Ash,please.."
Ash(angry) : "the silver screen,the radio,the tv,the
internet,the gramophone,the godforsaken mobile.."
Tracey(laugh) : "we won't be able to express it in
front of.."
Ash(angry) : "My wife?huh? isn't it,My wife? what
is exactly Trace that everyone is concerned
suddenly so much about my wife,huh?what do you
want? do you want to see whether she truely longs
for me or not if i just choke.."
Tracey(solemn) : Ash,please,be patient"
Ash(bursts into anger,but not high pitch) : "No i
wont,what can you do about it?what can the
vultures do about it? the press,the cinema,the
internet,the radio,the roads.. s..,the most beautiful enu.."
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash get into the Hall of Fame
formally and just don't get into into farming."
Ash(grim) : "cause my wife..no,what is it that now
you're so concerned?,no let me finish..what would
my wife lose with those not being done? that's you
point ain't it?"
Tracey : "Ash,she.."
Ash(frown) : "that's it.it's always been Ash and
Misty and blah,blah,blah,beautiful b.. has come
and gone,f.."
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash,please spare these for another
day,are you going to Cerulian or stay.."
Ash(frown) : "so your saying that according to the
vultures,the husband should enjoy f.. man-wh.."
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash,take rest and let me go please
or talk about Pokemons"
Ash(grim) : "no i'll tak about anything with you if
only you don't drag Mist in and more
importantly,what is it Trace huh?you want me to
show you that my ge..
"Tracey(shout) : "Ash! please, don't tourture youself
like this and..oh no.."
Ash(laugh) : "my wife? isn't it? my wife? why and
how..no if you dare leave or stop me,i'll set you on
Thunder Chair immediately...what is it that people
are infatuated with Mist,huh?yes,she has a less
black skin,yes she's less at bay with battles,yes
she's less unfamiliar in hall of less mediocrity?
and? i know what they're thinking but I can be
brutal as well,you still can't..no i don't care and
nobody comes anywhere near me if i'm home,else
they know the result..get over the fact that how
can a once eber sweet flower like that wasn't
picked up by someone other that the f.."
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash! could you doubt yourself if you
heard those words in the middle of.."
Ash(laughing) : "words?"
Tracey : "exactly not Ash,that was your.."
Ash(angry) : "not this dumbnut again,ITS ME,not
mine,and so now i've pulled off a stunning
publicity stunt,Deceit Mastery,(laugh)on one sideto blindfold the family and on the hand hand to go
to the b.."
Tracey(smile) : "Ash,they are none except Misty for
you."
Ash(laugh) : "so you've finally been able to get
around the fact that if a Rhyhorn f.. someone
else's sl.."
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash,please,would you argue with me
without these words?"
Ash(smile) : "most gladly"
Tracey(smile) : "well,same as yesterday,staring
1.what you see in Misty that you don't see in
others?"..
Ash(angy) : "i'm warning you last time Trace,my
Mist is not a selling product,if you are
insinuating..if anybody..no that's it,from exactly
this moment on,if,especially a half-grown en.. like
you,manages two words with Mist and look at her,I
won't be able to restrain myself but to personally
make sure that doesn't go home alive.."
Tracey(sigh) : "Ash,this is your sketch..(hands overthe sketch)"
Ash(looking at the Sketch) : "thanks Trace.but hey
hand me over the other ones?"
Trace(taken aback) : "Ash"
Ash(smirk) : "Green,Rudy and Georgio and if
there's more,i'm personally going to erase all of
those godforsaken names that you're hiding
behind your fake smile.."
Tracey(forcefully hugging Ash) : "Ash,please for
her,stop killing yourself like this slowly,she can't
lose..."
Ash(laugh) : "for her?for her? Trace you tell me,
except her sisters does she ever had anyone else?
huh?no,no i need to understand this infatuation
that Brock has had the courage to honesty present
in front of me,and i'm as you know,would ever be
most happy if i could atleast atleast with my own
