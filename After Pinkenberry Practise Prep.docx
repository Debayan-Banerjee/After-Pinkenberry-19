(After Pinkenberry)
Tracey(laugh): "in-house-world-beware honeymoon goes to the public part again(all burst into laughter)”
Ash(frown) : "to the utmost delight of a trio called professionally-crooked-jackal(all burst into laughter)"
Misty(laughing) : "why is it so Trace,that you’re always the first to meet us?”
Tracey (laugh) : "my bad luck(all bursts into laughter)..anyhow how was the Suicune?"
Misty(hugging Ash,smile) : "heaven..but(laugh)..she didn't stay long(laugh)..we had Gengleye(all bursts into laughter).."
Ash(smile) : "how's work going Trace,your parents,Professor,Brock and finally Our Viol
Flower(all laugh) how about it?
Tracy(smile) : "just fine,just fine.. Cerulian needs you more though(all laugh)..ok come in, Gary's out,Lillie too for inspection..Dase went to Cerulian (all laughs)..Brock will come next month permanently,Violet well you know(all laugh),first says absolutely not(all laugh),then just totally dissolved.."
Misty(smile) : "how are all, really you know Ash just never allowed me to phone(all laugh)..said that any news,the Orange Elite4 itself will run after us to tell(all laugh).."
Ash(whinning) : "well,mobile would've strained my flower's ears(all laughs)..
Tracey : "no just Orange Elite4 told about Suicune..are they coming to meet our once only in all eternity being duo(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : "actually she came to meet my Dark duo(all bursts into laughter)..Noivern just about started to ask about her age related issues(all
bursts into laughter),just scoffes off to which he
later tells us,that girl,too frivolous(all bursts into
laughter)..chu-bro wasn't too happy that she didn't
battle(all laugh),Azumarill was very happy.."
Misty(laugh) : "happy to get away from Gengar(all
laugh)..and Gengar just as usual licked Suicune to
death(all bursts into laughter)..Gengar was with usout of the Pokeball all time you know why(all
laughs)..he's just Feraligator and Crawdaunt
combined(all laughs)...but Ash will leave him here
now(all bursts into laughter)..though then he
finally decided to take Gengar with him..and he
enjoyed more than us much to my poor Azu's
suffering (all laugh)..and Chu-bro was all over her
with the art of battling (all laugh)..those 3 were
always together at first then none cared to battle
so chu-bro got sentimental (all bursts into
laughter) and(laugh)..Azu thought ,she and
Gyarados could have some peace in the sea,only
for our Tickle Master to suddenly appear just as
they dived underwater (all laughes)..Ganger
teased both my poor girls,that he can
simultaneously beat both even on open sea and it
was just a trick to take them away from the island
and then scare them to death by creating
hallucinations all over(laugh,Ash Laughs)..but
finally the pest thought that might be too much
and said ok,if they can swim in dark night(alllaugh) with him,he'll admit defeat himself,which
Azu mouthed off saying that's a trick,and
Gyarados finally told him that, you're not allowed
at home(all bursts into laughter),to which the
pester master said then he'll himself steal my
balls and take them to water in dark night (all
laugh)..then finally just licked the hell out of
them(all laugh)..that made my girls realized what
a pest this meance is(all laugh) and was always
happy together since much to the misfortune of ocean creaturs(all laugh)..really Trace this dark brat
with our other gems is going to make life
unliveable(all bursts into laughter) for all..chu-bro
didn't mingle much with them later as his art
wasn't appreciated (all laugh)..but the Talonflame
and Charizard had some good time but they
weren't much out..Charizard and Tickel Master
has become instant enemies (all laugh) as
Charizard was doing his mood and show off
which tickle master didn't like and peatered him
and Charizard then said dark night is nothing as
he had the tail-flame the ln the dark pest got upsetand was trying to make my poor Azu water gun
it(all laugh)..that was stopped by others..
Talonflame is Noivern's ardent student(all
laugh)..so she settled many fights.. Greninja was
out very few times and the first thing she does is
to take me to deep ocean and she just had fun
with me and Gyarados and Gyarados is under her
wing now(all laugh)..she's the most sane among
the dark gang(all laugh)..just wants to have fun all
the time like hangout(all smile)..."
Ash(laugh) : "yeah,I went in deep ocean with my
Tickle master..Mist and me went there
separately..and he showed some of his tricks and
had fun..i though told him that i'm ground type(all
laugh)..so i'll be in grave danger if he did
something severe,but he just showed me a few of
his methods and all..this pest really has Masterd
the dark night,constant underwater version(all
bursts into laughter)..and that he showed me with
very little severity..Suicune came then,all they
met,she played around a bit,went to Mist to have agood look at the Water Empress and finally to me,
though she didn't like me cause i had Ganger(all
bursts into laughter)..just about 20/15 minutes
and off..amusing Pokémon..really they should
never be caught or be mingled with.. just so many
moods and very intelligent i got..far better than my
fearow (all bursts into laughter).."
(in the Afternoon)
Ash(laugh) : "well,finally Cerulian then,Mist(both
bursts into laughter)..i want my badge(both
laughs)...
Misty(laugh) : "i choose Misty Ketchum(both
bursts into laughter).."
.....(inside gym)...
Misty(smile) : "no Dase went back just as we started,she
just came here and was at () all the time,just a
day's fun..but (smile, hugging Ash's neck)Ash,

Ash(smile, hugging Misty) : "full lunacy(both
smile),well i'll have to settle many things here and
we both have to see the renovation and allthat,your room first i want to absoluty modify and
then(both laugh)...yeah just make it extremely topsy turvy
and the platforms 5 feet higher (both laugh)..so that the
mob gets scared to death(both laugh)..really

Misty(smile) : "i want my formalities(both smile),
you're not changing that right?"
Ash(smile) : "i only told them that i'll renovate our
the room according to my plans rest yours but,
actually its all my sweetie's(Misty giggles)..just
showed them the hardman attitude (both
laugh)..and um.."
Misty(smirk) : "hum,Ash Ketchum,finally total
lunacy has reached physical level(both laughs)..
(smile) i want to fondle my sweet bee all the
time(both smile).."
...(night)...
Misty(smile, hugging Ash) : "just this moment in
my room,Ah!can we close the gym forever now?
(both laugh).."
Ash(hugging Misty,smile) : "this my sweetie ever needed to be full,’my Ash’ should be with me(both smile at each other)...(laugh),by-the-way namecall(both laugh),where’s you fake wisdom mask now(both bursts into laughter)..and Mist,it would've been
very serious had we been in your room adoring
each other at 16(both burst into
laughter)..but(both laugh)..the break-in was a
great moment(both smile).."
Misty(smile) : "yeah..um,Ash, really you should've
just abducted me to Pinkenberry,and i would never
have come back just with you all the time.."
Ash(laugh) : "so,finally i've deceitfully(Misty
laughs) shut this damn gym down(both smile)...
it'll take me some time to adjust to Gym life(both
laugh)..but no,all your reports,just leave those
craps..Articles if about pokemons or other
technicalities you,rest me..my sweetie would
beam and giggle and play around(Misty giggles) all the time,and after the
renovation anything except pokemons all mine,my
Mist would just gleefully play around with her
Pokemons but unfortunately (both laugh)..some
damn Brats will disturb her(both laugh)..
Misty(smile) : "Ash,i just want you especially while
inside the gym..all time..but really(laugh,Ash laughs as well),no,I want to revive the show for
atleast a year,then i'll formally retire from it,then
as we decide.."
Ash(smile) : "yeah,but dear, don't rush ok,you need
to recover well first thing.."
Misty(smile) : "Pinkenberry has done 90%(both
giggle),the rest work...don't worry dear,i've hardly
felt any better ever and it's ok Ash,you know,every
day after show so much pestering all the time..but
now i can just be myself all the time.."
Ash(laugh) : "yeah,they probably have pestered you
for 11 years without any hope(both laugh)..this
will be fun to me that i get all your shows and
all(both bursts into laughter) the beloved
vultures(both laugh again)..but i also will dream the my flower dream(huggs Misty very firmly smiling,Misty smirks and laughs and hugs Ash very firmly)..but all my bunch is
yours to choose from but i must have my dark
gang with me minus Greninja,she's all yours.."
Misty(laugh) : "and chu-bro already has dumped
you(both bursts into laughter)..i would use
Snorlax(both bursts into laughter)..that huge teddy
bear is just dream..and Ash,with your tickle master around(both laughes),we won't need any other
securities..and yeah,we need him and Nivy,it'll be a
huge compound itself and indoor which is obvious
(both laugh)..but also those two should be here
sometimes..my bunch would love it..though very
brief visits(both laughs)..Ash,but they'll pester you
much with Official things.. though i realize that's
your goal now with the fun(both laugh)..but i want
to visit all those in Kalos and Unova..well Unova
Cilan will be overjoyed (both laugh)..and Kalos
well(both bursts into laughter)..but i've never been
to Kalos once..Sinnoh quite a few times,Unova
very little but and Greninja alone was pestering me
all the time about Kalos(both laugh).. sometimes.."
Ash(smile) : "sure,Kalos is where i've become what
i've become(both smile).. it's more of an
intellectual region,but really you know nothing
better than Kanto..so much variety..and all mostly
here's my sweetie(Misty giggles).."
Misty(laugh) : "but sadly in Cerulian City(both
bursts into laughter).."
Ash(smile) : "really Mist,i'm only all too excited,you
plan i work, that's all..my job is just inspection
and(both laugh) trash talking..i just want to spend
the rest of my life gazing at you,my soulmate,my-
self,I,my sweet Mist(both hug each other firmly
and smile at each other and keep hugging for a
long time).. it's just fun and games and we're
having many great staffs so yeah it's very exciting
really at Pallet and here both and virtually now that
Viridian Forest is also there and all,i really feel
good cause i just wanted to have my freedom and
for you as well,we'll get that very much now..
what's Violet's position(both laugh)?.."
Misty(smile) : "no, she's fine and herself wanted to
come after the first upheavals.. she's getting tired
as well but Brock being there finally it just
completes the cycle(both smile)...mom said that
she will appear suddenly(both bursts into
laughter)..no,i guess gym life won't ever suit her
really can't stay with all that goes around..and our
ceremony too..but(both laugh)..when is the formalCerulian Announcement..
Ash(laugh) : "that's a secret cause it'll be on
international TV(both laugh)..and i'll roast
everyone..but you know any of my bunch just watch them fool around with all(both laugh)..you actually should tell them to prolong it and keep a chair and popcorn there(both bursts into laughter).."
(3 days later,Misty back at Pallet and in Lab,Ash
has some works in Pewter)...
Daisy(bursts into laughter) : "that TV show Mist(all
laughs)..just unforgettable.
finally someone answers all those years of
pestering (all laugh) that too internationally..and then again why was his flower never invited to Kalos(all laugh) by all means show and Gym,(all laugh)..surely the water is less moist here(all laughs),but i don’t get this obsession with authorities who won’t spend the money to demoist water but would spend all and get bankrupt in grass gyms by mowing it to paradise(all burst into laughter)...”
Lillie(laugh) : " ‘Misty Waterflower is such a famous name’,’except Kalosed Unova(all bursts into laughter)... then gives his mowing opinion(all laugh),then talkes about Rock gyms getting neglected and bores them to hell by not talking about Mist(all laugh)...then finally so you’re marrying her?..i thought you’ve seen my ring(all burst into laughter)..then 'how did you come to know each
other,well certainly not the pre and post battle
formalities' (all bursts into laughter)
then they try their biggest mistake saying Mist is adored by many fans as does he so its really a dream marriage(all laugh)..i’m sure we never had an agreement on what exactly a nightmare is(all laughs)..’um..um..’(all laugh)..’yeah,like i ate too much onion yesterday lunch,so had a bad dream in noon,night dreams are more prolonged though but still not enough to digest a full show there is it?”(all laughs uncontrollably)...finally they had to themselves say that yes we realize you want privacy(all burst into laughter)...’yeah,you see,via my marriage..um..i’ve decided to be the gym leader myself,home maker,is that still in fashion though in case of celebrities?surely i’m no authority there’(all uncontrollablly laugh)...and exactly then my
favourite bit, 'so,will the show revive','of course,the
trials final () is on ()' (all bursts into laughter),and
then shows a fake document of his participation
(all Laughs) to create even more frustration..(all
bursts into laughter)....then they get him realizing that the one implication about Mist will send them to all hells(all laugs)..’Mr Ketchum you’ve had a huge name for long but the way you battle and all that,surely have made you a household name so anything would you like to share with the budding aspirants?’(all laugh)..’of course that is that learn to give respect,to own self,to the pokemons,to the challengers,to the gym leaders,to the support stuffs,to the authorities,to the Elite 4 memebers,to challenger’s pokemons,to the league organizers,to the pre-post battle formality managers(all laugh),to the fans,to the stars,to other people in general,to your professional life,to your own family overall and most importantly after all to your private life...right(all laughs uncontrollably)’...really Mist,once only
beau(all bursts into laughter)"
Misty(laughing) : "and he wants to change every
corner except..um.(blush,others smirk).."
Daisy(smirk) : "hum..everyday now?..(Misty
blushes and hugs Lillie,others smirk)
Lillie(smile) : "and also here Mist,Gary i've hardly
seen him any happier,all of us..i guess he just
missed being away for 4 years and really is doing
everything he can to compensate for that.."
Daisy(smile) : "yeah,Trace said this work and
staffs it's just going to give him so much time to
just be among Pokemons and all..i'm getting all
my things too..and all the staffs are really
excellent..and finally Kanto Elite4 is all over us
now(all laugh).."
Misty(smile) : "yeah,and i myself has got so many
things and he has told me all that he could..oh and
finally(laugh)..see he has even laughed off a scar
like the sludges off(all smile)..as usual on a dark
night cut off electricity (all laugh) and suddenly
appeared after TV announcement (all bursts into
laughter)..then basically sludges said they were
with their mates and all,and basically they never knew about me either much but Ash just told me
that he was rather stern and said not to mingle at
all but also encouraged sludges on that they're
doing now and their mates and all..sludges has
been made absolute pets if they weren't enough
before(all smile)..and all..(laugh).. basically he has
threatened the. whole City not to pester at all as
he said 'so As you see,i've been to Safforn's
famous forest many times at nights to learn about
the mysterious ghost types(all burst into laughter),but now I just
want absolute and everpresent peace and quite
inside and outside of the Gym that’s all,right(both burst into
laughter'(all laugh)...and finally his bunch(all
bursts into laughter)...but with all that he has
learnt,still just doesn't understand what the gym
leader actually does(all laughs)..and it was more
so because in Kalos and almost all of Unova,he
just told them to go full force and just laughed
them off but also got dissapointed cause a gym
leader almost never gets to show that,so that
burden now falls upon me(all laugh)..a poor kidcomes and Gyarados full force(all bursts into
laughter)..well now telling that to Foster(all
laugh).. Pewter's getting so so many things and
you know Foster being the ever sweet kid,asks me
is it for real(all bursts into laughter)..and no wonder he’s such a dreaded name to all concerned just the last bit ‘yeah thank you,thank you i most wholeheartedly thank you for giving me the opportunity to EXPRESS my views,ideas,thoughts,actions,hobbies,personal choices(all burst into laughter),my bunch,my skills,my achievements,failures,my success,my,my,my,a great pleasure,Thanks(all laughs uncontrollably)...just think what this guy could do to all those mere mortals who pestered us(all burst into laughter)...’right,whom would you like to meet,if you might?’(all laughs uncontrollably)...this he actually did say to a onlooker in the renovation area(all laughs uncontrollably)...with that much name and antics and all acts like that and then those words,in the renovation site went like totally oblivious to surrounding..then says that line(all laughs)..then trash talks all like did to me goes to a gym just his bunch laughs off and either you’ll become friends for life or if ego ,sorry my bad,that’ll eventually put you to such hells,you’ll have to be cured..everything contradicts everything...(laugh)..."
Lillie(laugh) : "well he has spoilt my beau too(all
bursts into laughter).. suddenly went out with
Blastoise and says hasn't trained in ages and
battles for long..told me he's competeting in the
competition (all laugh)..well we all know where
that'll end up(all laughs)..and Grandpa is also very
happy cause he gets so much comfort now and all
he will do is to share his knowledge,Gary also says
almost all burden will go off his shoulders and
all..but the biggest news is Crawdauntogator has
finally agreed to visit Professor Kukui for one full
weak(all bursts into laughter,.)..3 months
later(all laughes uncontrollably)..i'm so happy(all
laughs)..but you know Sinnoh is going to be in
grave danger with Kanto pokeballs(all bursts into laughter)..Ash just
doesn't want at present that the Tickle Master and those two brats would be together for long(all
laughs)..but Grandpa's trouble is that with his
much lessened burden,Muk gets to fondle him all
the time(all bursts into laughter).."
Daisy(laugh) : "well i also trained my Dewgong and
Starew as well(all laugh)..but no way i'm
battling..and Trace suddenly has got too excited
too about battling,says he's going all out with only
Scyther(all laughs)..and he ever only entered a contest 20 years ago(all laugh)..Mrs Ketchum,i've never seen
her happier,always with Cassey and and all
those..the whole Sinnoh Elite4 is Master's
absolute pets(all laughs)..no really Trevor the
head there was telling us about how dangerous
the Undercover was especially Ash being the main
battler.. they'll be eternally grateful really(all
smile).."
Misty(smile) : "yeah,he told me what he used to do
there and and also Charizarded me to Lance(all
bursts into laughter)..in his obviously illegal time
scale (all laugh)..Kanto Elite4 strangely never was
in terms with Ash,all rest are big fans..Lance wasin much trouble but now absolutely fine..Lance
jovially showed me the picture that the master
cried before for 30 minutes or so(laugh,rest
laughes)..and the master has bought it now of
course (all burst into laughter)..yeah that special
gym one..and finally our rocket-sweet-duo(all
laughs).."
Daisy(laughs) : "that's why he actually took you
there(all laughs)"
Misty(laugh) : "yeah,very brief but of course,those
guys after 10 years,they congratulated us and
reminded us that they're still after Pika-bro(all
laugh)..and just had a brief joke..finally Mewoth
said like 'hows the bugging goin'(all laugh),to
which we said bugs can't talk(all laughs)..it was
fun..Ash virtually insinuated(all bursts into
laughter) them to their new life..it was good..and
so many things he told me and all..(laugh)..i'll just
need ages to come into terms with all he says.."
Lillie(smirk) : "so how's the young flower dream
going(all bursts into laughter)"
Misty(laugh) : "only married couples(all bursts into
laughter).. only if they have children(all laughes
uncontrollably),with upto 8 year old children(all
laughs again)...no he's just my biggest ever pet
now(blush,all smirk and then all laugh)i can do
whatever I want but i'll really you know have to get
our Viol Flower first(all laughs)..what's her
reaction to the list?"
Daisy(smile) : "no just overjoyed and overwhelmed
and total pet(all laugh)..Brock was also so happy
to finally come here and can do things on his own
terms,the legal procedures have started well,but
so many great people has come up,its just about
keeping your head right that's all..finally though
Mist,your pet has packed up all the flowers
together(all laughes uncontrollably)"
.......
Brock&Ash(Viridian Forest)
Brock(laugh) : "the only place never travelled together,how about a date?(both laughes)"
Ash(frown,laugh) : "Sweet sweet Brock,what means never?(both bursts into laughter).."
.....(finally in the Gym)...
(1st Challenger,9:23)
Ash(scoff) : "stupid brats..(Misty laughs)"
Misty(laugh) : "Ash,please don't come anywhere
near during battle(both laugh),it'll be impossible
then(both laugh).."
Ash(frown,scowl,laugh,tendering Misty's
cheeks,whinning) : "no,my sweet flower should
always be sweetly tendered(smile,Misty laughs)..
(scoff) keep that dumb bufoon waiting the whole
day(Misty laughes uncontrollably)..(smile)...
besides i've secret plan to gaze at your scowls
while battling (giggles,Misty smirks and pats Ash's
cheeks,then both firmly hug and laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "anyway,let me get ready(both laugh
and smile).."
Ash(laugh) : "to come to my arms(hugging Misty
and picking her up,both laugh)"
(after Battle)
Misty(laughing .) : " 'Sandshrew i choose you(bursts into laughter)"
Ash(scoff) : "those dumb buffoons,should’ve been Metapod(Misty bursts
into laughter,Ash also laughs .ly a bit later,the
two hugs each other firmly).."

Tracey (laugh) : "man,you haven't changed a bit in
18 months, swearing anywhere (all laugh)..just

Ash(whinning) : "But,Daisy it's just.. Trace still
doesn't have a clue on what is to be done in 14
years(both laugh)..and why me?.."
Daisy(smile) : "there's a reason,just go on,Mist will
herself do the rest,she can't do it without you this
special term..and you'll always have to do it from
here on(Daisy and Tracey bursts into laughter,Ash
sighs and shakes his head)"
Ash(frown) : "fine but.."

Ash(hugging Misty very firmly, smiling at her) :
"just be careful dear..i'll see you..(whisper)..hey

Misty(few moments later,hugging Ash very firmly,
smiling at him) : "soully(both beams)"
......
(almost everyone crying,this is just before the final
introduction of Ash)
Misty(crying herself,singing,this is last as she
introduces after her till life to this moment):..What makes me Misty all and all/In my soul and my
all/is that,I'm my Ash forever/again and
again(ends her song)...(all crying and then
suspense as Ash hasn't replied or appeared with
full view)
(Ash finally appears in front of Misty)
Ash(solemn,firm grave voice) : "ever-present,ever
here i'm what i'm/at my birth you said Ash Ketchum
but i'm what i'm/hindered by body-mind never am i
ever the whole/i've got nothing to say,nothing can
describe my soul/i've got nothing to do, nothing to
be,nothing to rue/i know who what i'm,forever free,
that's all ture/what i said just before is true for you as you hear/but if you have projected another from yourself to call my dear/then a way to realize me,is whom you call Misty/I'm that,I'm that,just take a look I'm Misty"
(all bursts into tears, .s,etc)
(Ash&Misty,duet,facing each other,firmly holding
hand in hand)
Ash(smile) : "not the body"
Misty(smile) : "neither the mind"
Ash(smile) : "not even the soul"
Misty(smile) : "just can't be defined”
Ash(smile) : "if projected by me"
Misty(smile) : "then it’s me as thee"
Ash(smile) : "thus ever one forever"
Misty(smile) : "no nothing else never"
Ash(smile) : "in relation now you’re my wife dear"
Misty(smile) : "you’re my husband ever the most near"
Ash(finally hugging Misty very firmly and looking
into her eyes,smile) : "so that’s one seeming as two"
Misty(finally hugging Ash very firmly and looking
into his eyes,shivering voice,tears,smile) : "that is how me
seeing me as you"
(then Ash smiles and wipes Misty's tears off a few moments with a whisper to the
huge cheer,Misty beams at Ash
and then they hold their hands together,quickly
hugging each other and shows the joint fist
towards the crowd looking at them with a broad smile)
(the whole place bursts into
.s,tears,cheers,etc)
(show ends..)..........
after Show(later restroom)
Ash(laugh) : "so you see Mist,we've always been
eavesdropped in our personal moments but now it's
international(both burst into laughter) and of
course that damn song(burst into laughter)
Misty(laughing) : "you know Ash,if just after you
namecalled them(both laughes
uncontrollably)..that would've been the most
brutal.."
Ash(laugh) : "i did(both bursts into laughter)..said ya dumb buffoons(all burst into laughter)..but
they cut the sound out(both laugh)..Viol knows me
too well(both laughes)..but sweetie(hugging Misty
very firmly)...still crying for 'my Ash' hum?...(smiles
at Misty and hugs her very firmly)
Misty(smile, very firmly hugging Ash) : "really
Ash,this is my best moment in the profesaional
life...with my Ash,ever my Ash."
Ash(smile, hugging Misty) : "the name was
it,soulmate.."(both hug each other firmly and smile at each
other looking into each other's eyes)
Misty(some minutes later,dejected little) : “um..Ash..all was good..but..”
Ash(smiles and hugs Misty very firmy) : “Mist,look at me dear(Misty looks at Ash with little smile)..my sweet flower only beams(Misty smiles)...13 years is a very long time Mist,it’s only about 8 months more or less you never know,but also by then Gili,Blosie,Jase and whom we’re awaiting will be getting ready to get out for their first travel or if not then university...just look at that and then whatever but definitely it’ll be their future on our laps,JUST THAT.(Ash and Misty hugs each other very firmly and looking into each other’s eyes smile,Misty has little tears but smiles broadly)



.........
(Brock Comes later)
Brock(smile) : "um,i beg thy mercy Master and
Empress.."
(Misty bursts into laughter)
Ash(sigh,frown,.) : "master says,do i have to confess our permission to the whole world...(all burst into laughter)...(.ly,frown)
sweet sweet Brockoli(all burst into laughter),why has it occurred
to you that what went out there is a bit too
sweet,bit too emotional,bit too delicate,bit too.."
(Misty laughes,Brock shakes his
head and laughs)
Brock(laugh) : "Ash,you fought me for your 1st
ever badge 21 years back,it's just impossible to
believe man what you're doing now,just that you
and your soulmate have created an once ever international
sensation...i'm speechless..."
Misty(smile,hugging Ash very firmly) : "thanks
Brock,just came off from me...remember that right?"
Brock(smile) : "perfectly,i only wished you two
reaziled it the first day itself,many Vultures
would've had it a bit easier then(all laugh),but Ash,
surely how did you pull that off man?"
Ash(tendering Misty's head and hugging her,Misty
keep hugging Ash very firmly resting her head on
Ash's chest,Ash frowns) : "that's for later Brock
and Gengar to assist(all laugh),that's for much
later,first tell me about the UNIVERSAL Improvisation (all laugh
and smile)?"
Brock(smile) : "that's what they're going to talk
about most that the show was so real and too metaphorical(all laugh) but each couple wasn’t philosophical(all laugh)..and thus showed their joy not metaphysically(all laugh,. for Brock)..Misty is as ever,ever emotional around you and Viol said,
difficult for her not to see her Ash through eyes(all
smile,Misty smiles and keeps hugging Ash)...and
still the same...(Misty blushes and hides her
face,both laugh)"
Ash(smile, tendering Misty's head) : "thus the
improvisation,and timing i guess(all smile) ,but
Brock you've ever taught me timing cause according to your 21 years the timing is that,21
long long years back,
my very first badge but ever lucky to get off Onix
alive/now Steelix but Brock what you've done to him,that Foster
has to bribe(all laugh)/if you never
existed,Brock,whole life would've all been but to strive
/but as you know I'll ever say Brock,that day you were just naïve(all
burst into laughter)"
Brock(laughing) : "i guess dad was, should've said
only overaged married couples allowed(all laugh).."
Ash(laugh) : "through emotions(both laugh),is
Violet still sane(all laugh)"
Brock(laughing) : "needs a week..(all burst into
laughter)
Ash(laugh,tenders Misty's head,Misty hugging Ash
very firmly with her head on Ash's chest) : "but 21
years ago Brock,what would've happened to me if
me and Mist we're accidentally caught in same
pose as we're now(both laughs)..
Brock(laughs) : "compromising stuff(both burst
into laughter)...you would've been traumatized(all laugh),never striving again(all laugh).."
Ash(laugh) : "or legalize..(both laugh)..now Brock is how i did it and the
answer is,and for 21 years later is by virtue of
perfectly balanced insinuation (all burst into
laughter)...i just roamed around and last part was
rather easy with my trash talk self(all laugh)...Mist
was Mist and this being her last which if goes out
of here you're returning to your hellrounds
again(all burst into laughter),it'll be long
remembered..and surely you can't do any better
unless with a full future grand reunion (all
smiles)...but never going to announce that it's her
last which was her sweet intentions(both
laugh)but i told,just float the news so that the
buffoons buy it(both laugh) and keep the goons
hanging around 100 more years(both laugh) to actually
come to know it(all laugh)....and still you
know,ever so emotional around me,so i thought
rather would receive a smack(all laugh), received
salty bit(both laugh),too Mistyviously cute(all
smile)..um..no,no it's not what you're thinking(both laugh)..she's only my other half in million years never better(both laugh)...but the real fun i never got
Brock is what Mist was saying a few minutes ago
which i wish Violet allowed me,just that fist and
just before going off 'ya dumb buffoons'(both
burst into laughter)..atleast Cili would've loved
it(both burst into laughter)..really Brock would
you've minded it as we just showed words mean
nothing(both laugh)"
Brock(smile) : "well your grandchildren are going
to ,all days and sis,they're already(both smile,Misty
smiles at Brock who reciprocates with a nod and a
broad smile,Ash tenders Misty's cheeks and hair)"
Ash(laugh) : "well,atleast none is selling
badges(both laughs)..but still,if the dumb
buffoons have any brains then this'll be very long
remembered and Violet's endeavours will be
smoothly going on here,cause even then she'll try
to get Mantinally involved(both laugh,Brock
shakes his head),but just too much have
happened in the last 17 months which still wasn't covered as since Greninja's Kalos Wisdom finally
bestowed me eyes i could sail through somehow
though the only thing is that the current available
future is yet to express in clear terms how are they
disinsinuating things(both bursts into laughter)
but well many would be happy who knows the 18
months and this will be for them as well but yes
this ultimately is hopefully the end thus giving all
you a long deserved good rest(smile),and of
course you all are getting that now,Oak Lab has not much pest(both laugh)/then there is
my bunch with all,all enemies they’ll re-gell(both
smile)/as many fearows are coming here cause Muk beaued a certain to hell(both laugh)/then there is Unova there Cili says have to ready(all laugh)/cause many more 4 living there though Bayleaf cures the too greedy/
(all smile and Misty has little tears in her
eyes,hugging Ash very tightly,rests her head in
Ash's chest,Ash tenders her)/Orange,Orange,how sweet a
name,Telplocus can't be a puppy/but being totally Mistyfied,Mistyly became so happy(both
smile)/this suddenly got a few of them to become a bit angry/so (looking at Misty smile,Misty smiles at Ash with tearful eyes)Pikachupi has only once whined mom i'm not hungry(both smile,Misty tears in joy, hugging
Ash very firmly,Ash continues to tender her
head)/then i was all and dead but my Goodra was at the door/being there protecting me resend me to my lure(both smile,Misty smiles,tears of joy
and hides her face, hugging Ash very firmly,Ash
pats and tenders her)/yet i haven’t spoken here that my brother and sister-in-law/who’ve despite all own troubles got my all soulmates out of death’s jaw(all smile Misty looks at Ash with/
still a few at Hoenn tried their best to get me all
defamed/My family there send them to my sis(both smile)
to get Torchiced(both laugh) to the end(both
laugh)/ever happy am i to pester my now olden bros at lab(both laugh)/and there soulmates are my sisters by both sides,on me ever keep tab(all laugh)/but the biggest thing to ever happen is
what Chu told me personally/he said no,no
pokemon wants to battle actually(both broad
smile)...well i only recently came to know what the
Torchic did there(both laugh)...my Torchic bearer
in crime at Hoenn doesn't even want to know that
this is a legal thing(both laugh) and thus the
defectors flies off to all hells because if she gets
inside the court after knowing all details then(both laugh) then whole world will get divorced from
their beaus cause their proposals were all
wrong(both laugh)...Drew told later
that i just sweetly told them to sit(laugh) and went
in and May is now ferocious in her maternal leave
and doesn't want the word Pokemon to be
heard(both laugh)..and that's exactly why Drew
was threatened to take equal amount of
leave of 2 and half years(both burst into laughter) without
compensation by both means(both burst into
laughter)..and those started with saying that you
know Ketchum's Pokemons well(both laugh) and
so on she instantly gets to hells saying that she parted with me
12 years ago,why are they disturbing her especially now in her maternal leave,after
parting she won 3 main regional conferences
which they can check the validity of for
themselves and then says was fed up with the
system (both laughes) if they're trying to say why
she abruptly pulled off from doing those then
they might've never known what a happy personal
relationship is and to maintain that(both laugh)then eventually divorce comes in that they came
to disturb her cause they thought she was
single despite her maternal leave for 2.72 years(all laugh) as she doesn't cherish Drew
anymore (both laugh),Drew was spared for 3 months there(both laugh) and so on and then of course
goes onto Torchiced-Thunder-chair (both laugh) saying that's
the most beautiful scenery she couldn't illegally
create in her career but now she's going to legally
cause that's getting mandatory to each
participants(both laugh)...1 full hour lecture (both
laughter),oh this also includes a huge note on
gender bias as well(both laugh)...1 hour or more
monologue as soon as they said Pokemon Master
(both laughs)...then of course Drew gets the
epilogue as well(both laugh) and then Drew joked
that they took leave of him as 'Lord'(both
laugh)...what you learnt was way politer version
that she has driven them away(both laugh)..only a
few days ago i came to know the full details cause
only after she was very irritated cause i had to
know if they pesterd someone even in her
maternal leave did she tell Drew to say it...it was then when i came to know about her antics(both
laugh),but half a minute later retuns and cries that
she got irritated and all i didn't need to hear this
and so on,i said don't bother it's nothing but as i
said i had to know cause certain people are still in
my ears then only could shrew finish (both laugh)..
they're atleast not going anywhere near them ever
again(all laugh)...but the mega evolved Blaziken now(both laugh) isn't letting them
away soon at all(both laugh) thousands of
complaints already has been submitted to the
whole world (both laugh) on how not to disturb
people through people who dares to utter the word
Pokemon(both laugh)so finally they're going to
Torchically plead for mercy(both
laugh),but(smile),Brock,anyway, enough with the
past,let the FUTURE begin(all smile).."
Misty(a few moments later,hugging Ash very
firmly,little tears, shivering voice,joy) : "Brock would you
mind if i smack the hell out of this sweet cute
idiot now?"(both laugh)
Brock(laugh) : "profusely never in 21 years.(both laugh)
Ash(Hugging Misty quickly and wiping her tears
off then tendering her head,Misty keeps hugging
Ash very firmly) : "Brock,why is this temperamental
bug on too much salt(both laugh)?...said it's ok all
show,but then you saw(both laugh)...hum?..Mist
flower,what were the
words..stupid jerk,sweet bufoon,um..no..(both laugh),this
idiot,so sweet(both laugh),um,jerk,but so cute while sleeping..um..no,no(both laught)..is he sleeping well..um..i..mean may wake up..like bad dream..my dream..(both laugh),um...no..no..daydream..um..no..i mean..(both burst
into laughter,Misty smiles and keeps hugging Ash
firmly),but about smacking,Brock,Mist doesn't
have to do that the brats outside will do it
themselves (both laughes)...besides if they
inquire,given we've ever been eavesdropped(both
laugh),would they get to know that it was based
on reality rather than drama,but and give the
answer with the but,besides i'm a fully
professional retired husband(Brock
laughes),Brock, lets play a logical GAME(both
burst into laughter,Misty too faintly smiles)..."
Brock(laughing) : "well the answer is Cilan is
here(both burst into laughter)..301st(both laugh)..and the but is 3 to
go(both laugh,Ash and Misty cheers for Brock)..."
Ash(laugh) : "besides i'll keep the press up till
almost midnight( both laughs)...then would insinuate
(both laugh) that no i'll open the gym tomorrow but
may the gym from tomorrow start at 6:29:29 cause that's eternity for my Metapod ain't it Mist(both burst into laughter,Misty,tears,smiles)...?"
Brock(laugh) : "yeah, well actually it's your debut
and Misty's farewell,Misty got a clue?(both bursts
into laughter)"
Misty(smile,tears,sobbing a bit,shivering) : "I'm my Misty(all laugh)..(Ash tries
to wriggle away,both laugh,Misty hugging Ash more
firmly,tears rolling down but smiles)no you sweet idiot(both laugh).."(both
laugh)
Brock(laugh) :"anyway,i better get going enjoy you
two(both laugh)..yeah finally wisdom dawns 21
years(both burst into laughter)...but just for your info Ash,you will give a joint discourse today to the press no matter what
and then you'll go single in your type advantage at
midnight(both laughs,Misty smiles)... best of
insinuation(both burst into laughter)"
(few minutes later)
Misty(crying, hugging Ash) : "no..you..."
Ash(hugging Misty firmly,smile) : "sweetie,please
just the flow you know we don't hold these back in
family,hum?..and that's what it is among us, that's
why we're who we are...hum?...Mist,please dear,we've
come to an agreement right?..just forget.."
Misty(sobbing,few moments later) : "no Ash,it's ok,i know you and
family,but(looking at Ash,tears),just thought about
the ending scene and this is what's in my mind
since then that...(chokes,tears)"
Ash(smile, hugging Misty very firmly) : "Mist,we
already have and still awaiting to have,and you
know my sis,you know about my bro,why bother sweetie...Mist,please not
again,honey,this was your dream show and you'll
not again do it,we've had our times and will have
infinitely more..ok,no more,not now we have to get prepared to go the press...(laugh)..hey

Tracey (laugh) : "um...Mi.."(all burst into laughter)
Ash(frown) : "yeah wicked-jackal(all burst into
laughter)...how's your tail(all burst into laughter)"
Daisy(laughs) : "Ash,you've ever spoken about future,but i want to return to past,the day you
dated your flower and we were about to be past(all laughs)"
Lillie(laugh) : "the Demonboy part of the perfectly imbalanced evolution (all burst into laughter)"
Ash(frown) : "i see, meaning is clear but the sentence structure shows(all laugh) that Lillie was
bunking the unstolen Mantine classes(all burst into laughter)
Violet(laughs) : "for me now it's Mist stolen Ashtine(all bursts into laughter)"
Ash(laughs) : "my goodness,much honoured am I(all bursts into laughter) Director(all laughs),but
what is it exactly Brock,that this Ashtine can do but Ashtyke can't (all bursts into laughter)"
Brock(laughes) : "Ashtine can gobble up certain mermaids (all burst into laughter),by Ashtyke for
21 years only roams around Mistynes(all burst into laughter),and is too naive (all uncontrollably
laughs)"
Ash(frown) : "i see,the sweet-sour balance is rather improperly Violeted(all laughes uncontrollably),but among us present today is a great balanced man(all burst into laughter),but before questioning this only once Zeratinad impersonal man(all laughes uncontrollably) i must understand that what kind of effects are affecting certain traits(all laughes)...cause this venerable man now has to deal a bit too much with two lackeys(all bursts into laughter),one of whom
improfessionally taught me(all laughe) how to position myself so that a Goldeen doesn't pick up my
scents(all burst into laughter) but never taught me how to bushdrop on Weedels(all laughes),his
speciality of course(all burst into laughter) and then there's anothor man,whoose so fond of
certain ideas that if you say this road is going to this city cause written on the board(all laugh),to
this man it might still seem the compass is better suited (all laugh) in a place that's 10000 km away
from his region(all bursts into laughter) cause his compass is better than any other compass(all
laughs)across regions (all burst into laughter),which also includes his very own unknown maps of known places(all burst into laughter) but this man also happens to be a former gym leader,who was so naïve (all laugh) that he never tried to understand how to win a badge himself(all laugh uncontrollably) and thus he rather thought that that breeding or later being a doctor is a better profession cause atleast then he can get away from cooking professionaly(all burst into laughter),cause in his college there was a nexus that despite his skills in Pokemon Medicines and all,this man is a way better cook,so the degree should be,at the first sight of this man,feed him to the charcoles(all burst into laughter) and not let him out of the the kictchen so actually this man is better named as Brock Slate,FullTimeDoctor PokemonNoGoodSemiBoiled(all burst into laughter),anyway to return to the greatly impersonal intuition (all laugh) i may want to ask
the most venerable concerneds (all laugh) that a certain Professionaly Crooked Personal trio(all
bursts into laughter) is lurking around the Oak Labs under the VEIL of directorship now(all burst into laughter),to a certain Muk's utter benevolence (all laugh) but now I hereby ask the concerned authorities that how is the current balance of slyness and gentleness(all burst into laughter), what's the degree of personality in professionalism (all bursts into laughter),and finally whats the ratio of
doctoring vs crooking in paranormal gym leading(all bursts into laughter)..."
Daisy(laughs) : "too wicked to be impersonal(all laughs)"
Lillie(laughs) : " too doctored to be improfessional(all laugh)
Violet(laughes) : "most cunning and least personal as a crook(all laughes uncontrollably)
Ash(frown) : "much obliged am i by unCerulianedWisdom(all uncontrollably laughs)...so to begin
with, venerable unimbalanceable Professor(all burst into laughter), my question at your
impersonality (all laughs) is that what kind of traits in all concerned assures that a certain
boy(all laughes) and a certain flower(all laughes) if they are sweetboy and bugged flower(all bursts
into laughter) gets eavesdropped by cunning crooks(all laughes uncontrollably) and yes on
exactly which moments are they eavesdropped (all bursts into laughter),and it is also expected to be
expertly presented in a non-personal manner...thank you,Professor..."
Gary(laughs) : "to uninsinuably profess this(all
bursts into laughter),it must be pointed out first
for a better understanding to the Vultures (all
bursts into laughter),so that they may not be able
to swear any balanced insinuations(all bursts into
laughter),so the 1st point is
1.Sweet-boy(all laughs),which means too sweet to
not battle in an improfessionally impersonal way(all burst into laughter) according to
Pikachutionary(all burst into laughter)
then comes the flower,for which my perfectly
balanced lioness (all burst into laughter) is better
suited (all laughs)"

on personal motivations(all burst into
laughter),the concerned bugged-flower(all laugh)
was unhappy with her 3rd eldest lioness (all
laugh), especially in personal terms (all burst into laughter),cause her certain sweet sweet processions
like dresses,hair bands and
pins,pictures,cosmetics,sweet notes(all
laughs),cute teddy bears(all laughes) were
governed away(all burst into laughter) and
certains bugs were roaming around her at night
times(all burst into laughter)...so this flower is
bugged and bugs out of home to bug to the
forashend forest lake(all burst into laughter),a
forest full of bugs of course (all bursts into
laughter)...but there she sits for finishing,when a certain sweet sweet soulmated cute fish(all burst into
laughter) is fished out(all
laughs)...then...um...well..um...(all bursts into
laughter)... it's better suited for a certain crook(all
laughes) to uninsinute this stammering as he was
confided to this fact the very moment he just said
hi bugged-flower (all laughs)...so please,crook(all
bursts into laughter),serve us your great dishes
(all laughs)"
Brock(laughing) : "the crook is 21 years old and the bugged flower is 16 suddenly saw her appear at the gym doors(all laugh) so said,'hi bugged flower!
(all laughs),to which the reply
is,'um..ya!..hellow...did he.."(all bursts into
laughter),'excuse me 'mam bugged (all bursts into
laughter),i didn't get you','oh!i'm sorry,i'm bugged-
flower (all laugh),nice to meet you,but have you
seen him...'(all bursts into laughter),'sorry whom
are you talking about','oh that stupid idiot Ash(all
bursts into
laughter),jerk,moron,sweet,sweet..um..no..sorry(all
bursts into laughter),but did my Ash..um..(all laugh)..sorry(all laugh)..did Ash Ketchum from Pallet go into
your gym?...that..um..'(all burst into laughter),'yeah,he won the badge and is coming
right behind you(all bursts into laughter),'oh!so he
won,hey you sweetboy(all laughs)...how did you
win,show me your badge,no let me take it(all
bursts into laughter)...um..i want to fondle you
idiot.. sweet..cute..um..no...anyway(all bursts into
laughter)..you stupid jerk...show your badge'(all
bursts into laughter) to which the sweetboy says
sticking his tongue out(all bursts into laughter)...'hmm..bugged-flower,what were you
saying i can't win,this is the badge...na na(all bursts into laughter)...','um...excuse me venerable
sir,'mam,but i'm...',in unison the reply comes 'shut up'(all bursts into laughter)...so yeah to
unsunitute,the bugged flower found the sweetboy so sweet that she decided to follow him 24 hours
and boss him around,fake fight with him and all so that she could hug and fondle him all she wants
(all bursts into laughter)...back to balanced professing (all bursts into laughter)"
Gary(laugh) : "right,i can give the sweetboy account that he never bothered about anything in
the world cause he didn't know anything about it (all bursts into laughter) cunningly (all
laughe uncontrollably),but suddenly despite his outer behaviours,he was too sweetly interested
about this bugged-flower (all laughes)...i saw him then a few times and it was like...'yeah,sweet boy
how are you','hey bugged-flower,come here there's a pokemon(all bursts into laughter)...'boy,i'm right here','oh that's a pokemon, that's a pokemon,bugged-flower quick(all bursts into laughter)...then of course the bugged-flower comes and almost runs the boy over(all laugh) and the two goes to date excusing a pokemon and in front of everyone (all bursts into laughter)...so thus the
traits,the crook actually doesn't eavesdrop there but gets eavesdropped all the time(all laughs),cause our
sweetboy and bugged-flower were dating each other in front of everyone and fighting and all that
all things cause they barely knew or cared about the onlookers,so yeah,antivultureboy(all bursts into
laughter)...to excerpt the boy too sweet,by which the flower is too bugged(all laughs),by this bugging the boy in reverse is too flowered (all bursts into laughter),the crook like this plot cause he thinks he may be able to tell them to get the rings immediately (all burst into laughter) as it was just
a formality cause they were 16 and married for 16(all burst into laughter)...so yeah,a married
couple quarrels anytime anywhere all times if too sweetened(all burst into laughter)...so thus the
crook tried to tell them that while they were too sweet to each other which is better not
discussed(all bursts into laughter) cause the crook couldn't believe how can this be called
travel companionship cause these two have surpassed all sorts of hesitations that even a 16
year marriage has in 7 days(all laughs)....so yeah,the sweetboy and bugged-flower got married almost as soon they met and the crook unfortunately had to babysit them cause they were still 16 then and didn't understand anything beyond their unofficial marriage(all burst into laughter)"
Ash(frown) : "much enlightened are we, Professor
Oak...now to go to the second stage,the same
question applies but this is when they are
Orangeboy and toffee-flower(Misty laughes
uncontrollably hugging Ash, others laugh as
well)...(laugh)...sorry..(laugh)... toffee-flower is a
brilliant thing, Professor Oak,it was your words (all
laugh).."
Gary(laughing) : "first trophy,Orange-boy takes his
wife to home after Orange honeymoon (all
laughs),and the wife at 18 is so nonchalant,calls
Mrs Ketchum mom from day 4(all Uncontrollably
laughs)....and the Orange-boy forces his mom to
not fondle with his wife like telling her to contact
her sisters or to go to the balcony alone(all bursts
into laughter) else he'll runaway with her(all bursts
into laughter)...and the trophy is the toffee that's the
flower(all bursts into laughter)
thus toffee-flower (all bursts into laughter)...stays
here for a month(all laugh),even the oldest married couples said perfect marriage,just too young(all bursts into
laughter)...but it was of 19 years(all bursts into
laughter) so anyhow,TraceyDevil(all laugh
uncontrollably),a poem you heard a year ago,that
suits here to describe both traits and then why a
foxly gentle cunning(all bursts into laughter) were
sketching a marriage(all laughs)...by-the-
way,Tracey means a Daisyl(all laugh
uncontrollably) who is gentlemanly-shly-thus-sentimentally-
jackal(all laugh uncontrollably,tears)"
Tracey(laugh) : "right,professonal impersonal (all
burst into laughter),this poem was observedly sketched(all
bursts into laughter) and later recited many times
to the concerned person(Daisy laughs then all else
follow suit) but it's modified to describe 18th year
marriage of 18 years old 18 year couple(all burst into
laughter) - 'seeing the Mist all day and night(all
bursts into laughter)/holding Mist's hands through
dark and light (all bursts into
laughter,.)/Orange-boy you'll be killed if you
leave my sight(all bursts into laughter)/hold my hands tighter Ash or you’ll be in plight.' (all bursts
into laughter,.s,etc,Misty firmly hugs Ash and
blushes,Ash laughes and tenders Misty's
head)....so a gentleman-cunning(all laughs),always
knew what they were upto because as the crooked
man said(all laughs)...'um hellow,you two...are you
sure you're not married(all laughes
uncontrollably)?'
'what was that Trace,huh?!?what was that?!?...i'll
never mingle with a non-intellectual kid like him
never in a million years(all burst into laughter,
.ping)...but..um.. isn't
he..um...so cute,cute..um..i mean..nah that idiot(all laugh)..but still he’s um..very sweet,sweet..um..no..no...um...'(all
laughes uncontrollably)...and the Orange-boy says
'...hey Orange-boy, isn't this girl cute(all bursts into
laughter)...who..oh!you mean toffee-flower (all
laughes uncontrollably)...no in front of you that
girl(all bursts into laughter)...'um...that...looks like
toffee-flower (all laughes uncontrollably)"...then to
this toffee-flower says 'Orange boy whom are you
looking at(all burst into laughter)...then scream,you jerk(all laugh)..who is that namecalled
girl...hey you namecalled..i'll kill you...'(all laughes
uncontrollably)...then if toffee-flower is mingling
with other guys(all laughes
uncontrollably)...um..Ash, don't send Gengleye(all
burst into laughter)...
Misty(laugh) : “(mimicing Marshadow’s call) MAR_SHAD_OW ”(all burst into laughter)
Tracey(laugh) : “anyway(all burst into laughter)..no man 18 years whenever sees me Mr Skechit what’s the right proportion of your irritation(all burst into laughter) and then that Banette(all laugh),gave his ghostly food asked me why are you giving it shouldn’t you be holding it at present(all burst into laughter) so then Orange-boy
says,'what the hell she sees in that guy(all
laugh)...who that brat thinks he is(all laugh)...why i
don't get such attention from toffee-flower (all burst
into laughter)...'um..Orange-boy, she's always with
you.. it's..oh! shut up you fox(all bursts into
laughter)...let that brat come in,the badge i'll
anyway win(all bursts into laughter)...but I'll show
that brat...that...',then of course the boy is the
Master so eventually he gets the win in such a
fashion that if the toffee-flower already wasn't
enough eaten then now was finlly digested(all .
and laugh)..because the boy mastered the art of
impossible comebacks (all laugh),only when he
knew toffee-flower was there(all burst into
laughter)...yeah,you can remember till Sinnoh toffee-flower could directly listen to the
combacks(all laugh),but McShin was too naive(all burst into laughter)...then Orange-boy goes to Unova-Kalos which is
more untravelled and unknown by Johto-Kanto
group and especially Kalos,i asked a few there
how he was,hall of fame gyms when heard about
comebacks made a face like i was from Mars(all
laugh),said he never came what to speak of
back,joked-in-laughed-out(all laugh and .) in
Kalos and in Unova he was an ardent disciple of
his mad bro at his maddest Chuself(all laugh) and hence his then
stubbornness and temperament(all laugh) but beyond these all there was TYRAniTAR(all laugh and .) so,his
disposition alone threatened the best of hall of
fame gyms there to submit before starting (all
.) so the combacks were all to sweeten his
toffee-flower (all laugh),and after Sinnoh final she
was finally assimilated(all laugh),so then that
wasn't needed anymore(all laugh) same for toffee-
flower, can't win against Raticate(all laugh) while
with the Orange-boy so that he comes in for her
and she would gaze at him in action(all burst into
laughter) returns to gym tames a lunatic Gyarados of all singlehandedly (all .) and then becomes
a legend but again as soon as the boy comes
back to the gym for a long due date(all
laugh),same Gyarados is beaten by Steelix(all burst
into laughter) under a minute cause Gyarados was
beforehand trialed for such situations (all laugh)
to flamethrow the water out within 10 seconds(all
burst into laughter),which was kept at Golduck
height (all laughe uncontrollably) and Gyarados
then went to hug-it-out with Steelix(all burst into
laughter) so we know it(all laugh),then throws the
badge at the challenger without noticing whether
he could spot that tiny thing or not(all laugh) and
flies off to Orange boy within 3 minutes,sorry
just washroom(all laughes
uncontrollably)..anyway,Orange-boy also
intentionally comes back all the more
cause...eventually toffee-flower again jumps on
Orange boy fondling him all the time while saying
the whole battle was totally wrong her orders
wasn't followed (all bursts into laughter)...also hereby i must say that last month i was at Unova Elite4 and met Cilan there who said that in the last days at Unova the master started his antics telling anyone try to make Chu thunderbolt his own bunch(all laugh) and Chu who was at his most lunatic self cause his powers didn’t saturate(all laugh),well never will be(all laugh) and this included female brats(all laugh) as soon as they came near,’ ‘mam i’m sorry but i must go to washroom why don’t you have a look at my Pikachu..’(all laugh) and that was it cause Iris and Cilan was afraid to go anywhere near him and after that 1st brat incident Chu was directed a 1 foot female brat circle(all laugh),just to jump on them and then threaten them(all laugh) and Chu looked dangerous always sparking and only Ash could handle him then cause he was ever sparking a little and Ash was used to it...so you can understand misbehave and thunder-chair(all laugh)...and since then Chu doesn’t use any other electric attack unless he’s playfull,first thing he’ll do is thunder-chair and can deliver may be a 1000 all increasing powers strating from an unimaginable level itself and yet be alright to continue battling for a 1000 more with same efficiency...of all no female brats would want that would they?(all laugh),but later the more dangerous version of thunder-chair was eloquently manufactured(all laugh) as the fool-around master fully grasped
the precise anatomy which
even made Mrs Ketchum concerned (all laugh) as
i later heard that unless for soulmates a kiss is
being spat at from point blank(all burst into
laughter)-this was directly said to Mrs Ketchum on
1st day after marriage in front of his wife to
differentiate his wife from the rest so what to
speak of mere mortals(all laugh) and this the
Master himself told me before that memorable
poem(all laugh) if you have a crush but don't go
through hellrounds and all to check whether that's
soulmately valid(all laugh) which in gross terms
you have a crush but if it’s for any reason,get arranged of go bust(all
laugh) then gave another poem 'the very first rays
of morning dawn/when i first saw you at my
heart's lawn/since then i see you then and
now/full of cough and spit,take a bow(all laugh
uncontrollably)... but Mrs Ketchum is only dissapointed that a certain deal is always
made(all burst into laughter)...so this observation
must be sketched down(all laugh)..."
Ash(smile) : "done.(all smile)..my beautiful
anatomy with the beautiful hellrounds will
beautifully worsen beautifully without beautiful namecalls(all
laugh) but yeah i'll review the hellrounds
implementations and eloquence of deliveries of
the students(all laugh) but also this is the lesser
half as you see(all smile) the better needed one
moment but lesser nedded 19 years(all smile),
though i'm never sure of the better bugging
around implementation given THE LAW(all laugh
and .s) but i expect now extreme swearing as
the sun for this whole hangout is a bit less
lightened at present cause out of blue since a fake
show an illusion is intruding that absoluty
anything related to it is too sweetie but the
particular mention of the word Unova is very salty
despite the inevitability that today itself it'll be
heard during night many times but you've may benow noticed that the glee is half joined by the sun
since that explicit namecall due to delusional
illusions."(Misty huggs Ash very firmly with tears
rolling down,wipes off her tears,and smiles at
him,Ash smiles at her pats her tenders her head)
Violet (smile) : "Unova is will be the name Mist,unovize
it(all smile)"
Brock(laugh) : "but please keep Goldy away(all
burst into laughter),now lets jackal it up to
Unovanize"(all laugh).
Tracey (smile) : "unovan Cilan unovanly told all
unovans to unovanly organize a unovan tribute to
uovan Noivern who is unovanly fond of our unovan
toffee-bug(all laugh)."
Daisy(laugh) : "hey namecalled Unovan
namecalled Water,i'll especially sanction that any
Unovan gets the badge without battling but using
lunatic Unovan Gyarados' to show that Misty
Flower doesn't hug Unova(all laugh) and i'll also
recall the Unovan baby sis from the gym to look
after two persons who are looking very small now but all these appearences as the ONE reality is
appearing as Blossom and Jasmine too fondly
especially due to another evenutality that they
may too soon be treated as little fearows(all burst
into laughter)...well he's already insinuating that
Daisy doesn't like him anymore cause she hasn't
invited him at her room(all laughs uncontrollably) "
Lillie(laugh) : "i'll open a certain r word box(all
laugh) brought from Unova to pour it down
unovaishly on the Unovan r.. worded ugly
namecalled whatever (all laugh)...besides Misty
girl, Gili will call you an Unovan r.. aunt,that rhymes
as well(all laugh) unless you fondle him to death
all the time(all smile) but he may like to exchange
your Pokeballs for obvious reasons (all burst into)
"
Gary(laugh) : " hmm...Misty girl..hmm..(all
laugh)...Unovan Uno-pess...hmm...(all
laughs)..catches Unovans..hm..(all laughs)...goes
to Unova,fishes a sweetboy,hostages him at his
Unovan home forcefully marries him without a ring(all laugh)...hmm...then nonchalantly come here
saying she has a lesser half but not other(all
laugh)...hmm... besides Misty, don't get
impersonally Unobalanced (all laugh)...now it's
time to sow the quotes that were
sweared,jackal,fox it(all burst into laughter)"
Tracey(laugh) : "Unosistence per Unocise
Unoceptions(all laugh)"
Gary(laugh) : "the cooked man was most cooked
so let him have his time(all burst into laughter)...
Unnesseciate the necessary if the necessity is
subtle enough i've not changed it shade that(all
smile)"
Brock(laugh) : "well a certain short-tempered
unovan bug may insinuate that(all laugh) during
timescale things have changed in the last 17
months,which vulture is now being abjectly
sweared off(all laughe)..by a certain sweared
theory the Master implied(all laugh)...that a
certain accident isn't certain at all and thus the
future(all smile)...so thus the future is but this time not sweared in(all laugh)...all of us,what did the
master say about gurdianship?"
All in Unison(laugh) : " shared future policy (all laughes
uncontrollably,Ash shakes his head and laughs and Misty too finally
laughs,to others cheers)"
Misty(smile) : "um..yeah,the better half teaching is
that my Unovan Gyarados is idiotically so sweet
sweet so you namecalled get off to Unova while i
devour him up(all laugh and .s,Ash and Misty
hugs each other firmly and smile at each other for
a few moments)..right,too cutened(all laugh and
.)..and about the Unovan future right,hey all you
callednames(all burst into laughter,.s), there's
only one thing to do - fish-fondle-spit-the-head-off-
repeat(all burst into laughter)"
Ash(smile,a few moments later) : "well things have
got too Mistyvious here(all burst into laughter and
.)...so jackal(all laugh) sketch it down(all burst
into laughter)"
Tracey (laugh) : "so the jackal minutely
observes(all burst into laughter)..then 'um..you two...are you sure you're not couples(all burst into
laughter)'...in unison they scream at me
'NEVER'...'its just um...we're...too fond friends...(all
laughes uncontrollably)...um..we mean best..um
no close...um..no,no..great...no,no...very
good...shut up you jerk!..hum?!?..what was so
special about that bloke hum?!?'(all bursts into
laughter)...then again this fight is just about who
can hold others hand and continue gibberishing
while intently looking into each other's eyes(all
. and laugh) for how long and how much
prudently (all bursts into laughter)..so that even
any other gross observation also is they
themselves (all . and laugh)..anyhow so the
fox just gave them some observed memories(all
bursts into laughter) and they were in all bushs
possible(all burst into laughter) which were
absoluty public (all bursts into laughter)...so this
the 17th to 18th year of marriage and just after
they left for Johto Mrs. Ketchum was very
concerned actually (all laughes uncontrollably)...asked me why didn't they settle
down in Pallet(all laughes uncontrollably)...by the
way Ash, she's very angry that her daughter-in-law
was crying yesterday(all burst into laughter)..."
Ash(laughes) : "just my Mimey(all burst into
laughter)"
Tracey (laugh) : "right,but still with this the toffee-
flower and her family relation skills(all laughs) at
their Pallet stay is going to be elaborated,now to
transfer you to the via poem ....which (laugh)..i'll
ever remember the occasion of so i'm saying the
original version...this he was telling me if his
surprise at that set up farm where Gary was
urgently called in at 6:00 in morning with all possible
papers (all laugh)..so he's trying to say that what a
great thing awaits me given what i'm already(all
.)
'seeing the days through bright. and pale(all .s
and laughs,Daisy also laughs)/sowing the sketch
through tooth and knail(all .)/rowing the fate
so why to sail,(all .,cheer)/(laugh),so Trace march on,(growl)unto the Hell(all laughes
uncontrollably,tears)'...."
Daisy(laughing) : "right so our sweet little toffee-
flower marries the Orange-boy obviously without
telling us(all burst into laughter) and hostages her
husband in his own house(all laughes
uncontrollably)...now,we tell her to come back
atleast for one full day(all laugh) then go back she
of-course can't let her husband go out of sight (all
laughes) and viseversa (all bursts into
laughter)..so she quarrels and all that(all
laugh)...then Mrs Ketchum spoke with us very
concerned...'um...yeah,Daisy,i understand, she's a
very nice girl but..um...(all bursts into
laughter)...',why Mrs. Ketchum has she done
anything?...no no not that... it's ok..but she calls
me mom as well(all laughes uncontrollably)...then
i obviously realize that she's not going to return at
all(all laugh)...so i still say how is Orange-Boy and
all...'um...no Orange boy is ok,but those two
together (all laughes).... doesn't even bother aboutmy presence (all laughes uncontrollably) and i
asked orange-boy when she'll go home (all
laughes uncontrollably)..to which he probably has
told her to call me mom(all laughes
uncontrollably,tears)..' and so on was going,but
this is only the first stay(all laughes
uncontrollably)...later our Gym Leader the now
Universal water Empress would go there and we'll
see what happens to that great personality once
the sweet-boy comes around(all bursts into
laughter)...so now we're back to the personal non-
professor(all laughes uncontrollably)"
Gary(laughs) : "so you see vultureboy (all
laughs,.s),the Orange-boy and the toffee-flower
(all laughs),were preparing to get settled down a
bit(all laughe) anywhere (all bursts into
laughter)...so a gentleman looking most cunning
fox(all bursts into laughter) was unfortunately
made their ride(all laughes uncontrollably)...and
thus the eavesdropping"
Ash(frown) : "i see,by the way gentleman,younever traveled with me again, alright you were
afraid of me and my wife(all bursts into
laughter),but then i also travelled alone though you
would've made my life unbearable if you were
present with a crook and a devillish little sister(all
bursts into laughter),whoose now off course too
twin rosed up to fondle her one rose(all laugh) in
regular intervals(all laugh) as we were going at
each other before this conference (all laughes)..."
Misty(laugh) : "attention!toffee-flower wants to bug
around(all laughs,cheer,.)..(laugh)...this is from
the 2nd visit cause then the Master was beeing
around his sweet sweet flower(all laugh) at his
own home(all laughes uncontrollably)...and to
what went before between little sis and big bro,is
proper so saying,this is perfect to tell Lil from my
side so saying->
"so Venerable impersonal gurdain(all burst into
laughter)/please help us to explain/yeah,the initial
days are strain/but not fondling you at all(all
laugh),still is sane(all bursts into laughter)?and then,this was the sister's reply (all laugh)...
Viridian Misty Hi(all bursts into laughter)/Johto
Misty bye(all laughes uncontrollably)/no Misty i'll
die (all laughes uncontrollably)/see Misty, you're
all my(all uncontrollably laughs,tears)...."
Ash(laugh) : "right,but as you see -
'tracing the jackal through bush and hey(all
laughes uncontrollably)/Professor comes never to
wish you a single day(all laughes
uncontrollably)/behind you there's a crook,without
a say(all laughes uncontrollably,tears)/elder
flowers your beaus have gone to the bay(all laughes
uncontrollably,tears,Misty too follows suit)
Violet(tears,laugh) : "by the way,i remember the
great master when he came to nourish the youngest flower(all bursts into
laughter) after the Battleside Show frontier(all
bursts into laughter)...
'hi i'm Ash mam,came to stay(all laughes
uncontrollably)/you're not a challenger so please
see your way(all laughes uncontrollably)/hey namecalls i know you where's Misty say(all bursts
into laughter,tears, laughes
uncontrollably,.s)/Misty comes next day who's
he anyway(all laughes uncontrollably,tears)
Lillie(laughing) : "yeah then his present to his
girlfriend returning home after 1.5 years later,i was there->
'so Ash what have you got for Misty say(all
laughs)/um..mam nothing much,just a trophy
today(all laughes uncontrollably)/you brat are you
sane wheres a flower bouquet (all laughes
uncontrollably)/Lil don't try me the trophy is 10
years a way(all laughes uncontrollably)..."
Daisy(laughs) : "and i recall,one day his Mist
flower was gym battling(all laugh) so i picked up
cause i just didn't want to battle and insinuated
(all laugh) Mist flower to do the job cause i wanted
to Ketchum up a bit(all bursts into laughter),this is
his Sinnoh,this is after he had won 153 all hall of fame badges
before the final(all laugh)-> this actually was the excerpt
cause he used to call around 1:45(all laughes),his
system was that he would chat 45 minutes or so(all laugh) to get his energy drink and then again
go out(all laughs)...and night 11:10-11:40 each
day(all bursts into laughter),same reason many
times Mist said barely would talk more than 15 minutes (all
laugh)..main talking all at noon this to complete the one hour(all laugh)..night would just would
sweetly say,'um Mist can't i gaze at you for 15
minutes cause i want to dream you sweetie'(all
laughe uncontrollably)..and the night is always
video call,noon always normal call so that his
friends and pokebrats don't misbehave(all burst
into laughter),who were anyhow later controled by
his lunatic mad bro(all burst into laughter) who
somehow from the 2nd day itself like the Master
has separated Mist from the rest totally and now you know all(all laugh)..how’s he doing Ash(all laugh)?”
Ash(laugh) : “i’m misbehaving(all laugh) total stranger now(all laugh)...thus send to the Lord(all burst into laughter)...Lord was very dissapointed that the legend didn’t let him finish cause only a legend can bear patience with the Lord which to Lord meant except his 106 sinister comrades there’s more who adores the Lord(all laugh)..philosopy 5 and their lackies Infernape and all are something indeed..(all laugh)...”
Daisy(laugh) : “just hope they don’t go after my dolls frist day out(all laugh)...right..Mist
then said,the sweetboy would get up at 4:55 and after that getting
fresh nothing,wake up,next thing is thunder-
chair(all bursts into laughter) and that 5 minutes
for not making extra was spent before work 5
minutes would cover his face completely with that handkerchief(all .)...Trace told me later,this is after confession-> wake up 'um..hey Ash good
morning','yeah,yeah, enough(all laugh),why is it so Trace
that i don't hear the first and last word of the day
from my Mist(all laugh)','Ash,why don't you just
marry her','i don't know,but marriage,well Mist said
thus is married life(all burst into
laughter)’..anyway,he'd go on to Thunder-chairing
just after waking up and water pokemons would
brush and freshen him up that's all(all
laughs)..night before sleep around half an hour
was his Mist gazing time(all burst into laughter)..
Brock and Mist both said video call ends go to bed
wouldn't hear anything at all said i want to dream
well(all laughes uncontrollably)..so he'd call half
an hour,15 minute talk then Mist can sleep on the table anything but
he wants to gaze at her whole time and one day both
those two fell asleep while in the call(all
laughs)..anyway so his gazing time is very
important..and would do exactly that without
much words(all bursts into laughter)...anway this
one time the master wasn't in particularly sweet-mood(all laugh)...this is noon...
"Mist Mist,you’re so sweetie(all laugh)...how are you?what are you doing?what
have you eaten for lunch(all bursts into
laughter),what's your bunch doing(all laugh)...'oh
you're so sweet,i want to eat you up(all bursts into
laughter)...like Gyarados(all laugh) but come closer i wanna
look at your eyebrows(all laughes uncontrollably)...and
that's it(all burst into laughter)....the rest is all
Gyarados and every detailed body movement that
Mist does during battle(all laughes
uncontrollably),every moment out of battle,what she thinks at every moment during tha full 24 hours,even knows what she’d dream as well(all laugh),everything about Mist he has to know and unless Mist wants to say anything
or he has and that's it(all laughs)...Ash, Gyarados
helped you for 8 years didn't she..."
Ash(laugh) : "indeed Daisy(all bursts into
laughter)...before i saw Kalos Wisdom via
Gengaring through libraries at dark nights or mid
noons,when none misbehaves(all bursts into
laughter)... that's another part of my life...because
there were 3 little brats around me(all

Ash(laugh) : “those 3 brats spoiled Gary(all laugh) now the other two couldn’t keep pace but Magmorter joined(all laugh) and with Golem are totally spoiled(all laugh) cause they have been with Emboar and Tyranitar(all laugh) so no hope(all laugh) and Gary was that he would jump on anyone and his pokemons had to decide how to do that and protect themselves(all laugh) while Gary studies the type specifications(all laugh)..in Johto was serious(all laugh) so somehow managed a great electric competition winning against 4 or 5 time league champ(all laugh) but then that match(all laugh), most of Gary’s pokemons would be all power cause he wanted to show muscles only(all laugh) and tormented his poor Treecko and Warlotle so much(all laugh) then got Magmorter and all now all too personal(all laugh),Tapu Koko and Victini etc fled as soon as Feraligator came in(all laugh) they knew this brat now with Snorlax(all laugh) will decimate our sanity(all laugh) and yeah Snorlax was spoiled as Feraligator as well but didn’t start that like him cause he was sleeping(all laugh) woke up thay said whoose your beau(all laugh) Feraligator(all burst into laughter) does he attack to be beau(all burst nto laughter) but you know what Snorlax was during the phase called TYRAniTAR(all laugh),anyway,Electrivite is still sane(all laugh) but with Rotom(all burst into laughter),but that match professor 16 years what about 2 words(all burst into laughter)?”
Gary(laugh) : “exact words(all laugh) no i wouldn’t have given up before doing Frontier atleast had it not been Ashey-boy(all laugh)..first Ashey boy got married the first moment he stepped foot in that jungle(all laugh) and what a Gyaradosey wife(all laugh) comes here 3rd day says,’mom my Ash(all burst into laughter)..um..Ash is my best friend(all burst into laughter)...’ ...”
Ash(laugh) : “is break is to say..”
All in Unison including Ash(laugh,Misty tries to stop Ash from speaking but Ash hugs her firmly all laugh,Misty frowns) : “ toffee-flower(all burst into laughter)”
Misty(frown,hugging Ash very firmly) : “why are you all spoiling my husband(all laugh)...IT’S MY PRIVATE LIFE WITH MY ASH(all burst into laughter)...he’s(all laugh) my sweet hubby(all laugh)...you(all laugh) namecalled inhumans(all laugh) don’t mingle with my Ash..Ash(all laugh) only you like me(all burst into laughter) these namecalls(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “cause you’re my toffee-flower(all laugh,Ash hugs Misty very firmly,Misty smiles at Ash and rests her head on his chest hugging him firmly)...so professor ”
Gary(laugh) : “well i was namecalled before the match(all laugh) and then later(all laugh)...and had to be first round(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “just a second Mr Oak cause i want to confess my longing for you(all laugh)..naming your full bunch ONLY(all laugh)..just make time or else i’ll set all psychics upon all of you barring Violet cause she’s most honoured(all laugh)..anyway,then Mr Oak Mr Oak then had these->
in Kanto he had 22 and Johto 8 only cause he was studying type specifications(all laugh) so this is his bunch->
Blastoise,Sceptile(all laugh),Beedril(all laugh) these were the two that he had when he faced Lillie there of course one on one(all laugh) Blastoise was Wartortle then and Sceptile was Grovile but Beedril was Beedril(all laugh) and Mr Oak Mr Oak took one month in the start to get Squirtle and Treecko evolved first(all laugh) in that type of evolution(all laugh) and then in Kanto he had Rhyperier,Nidoking,Magmorter,Golem,Electrivite,Tapu Koko(all laugh),Arcanine,Bastiodon,Vigoroth,Azumarill(all laugh) evolved mind it human jackal(all laugh),Meganium(all laugh),Aerodactyl(all laugh) his trasporter(all laugh),Dusknoir(all laugh),Victini,Kingler,Chesnaught,Oranguru(all laugh) that was some brat indeed(all laugh) but just so naive(all laugh) and finaly please welcome Scizor(all laugh) still evolved(all laugh), what a bunch that was but too much muscle(all laugh) then sadly went off from 2nd round cause he was type specifying(all laugh) and had he won would’ve got me(all laugh) well Mr Oak Mr Oak still has faced me twice in Kanto both ground type his speciality and was 1-1 score(all laugh) but then sadly got Tyranitar(all laugh) well in the first ground he smoked me off(all laugh) second one was something with Emboar vs Rhyperier(all laugh) and he still has had 5 psychics with Victini and Tapu Koko being psudeo-legends(all laugh) and has Dusknoir(all laugh) then from Sinnoh came Shiftree to revolt(all laugh) and Gilscor as well then from Johto he had Vigoroth,Umberon,Weavile,Ampharos,Empoleon,Noctowl,Dodrio(all laugh) mind it hasn’t left human(all laugh) and Carnivine so still great bunch but too type specified(all laugh) but no now i guess Magmortgolem will be totally spoiled(all laugh) so basically Mr Oak Mr Oak is in hall of fame 6,7 with Ghostradarkarrigussonor and everything that is associeted with me in gross terms(all laugh)..but he also has Giraora(all laugh)..yeah now Mr Oak continue as Gary Oak(all burst into laughter)..”
Gary(laugh) : “yeah this pest has poached my bunch for his circus(all laugh)..so in Johto i got 6->Oranguru,Aerodactyl,Azumarill(all laugh),Tapu Koko,Golem and then Dusknoir(all laugh) and 
Ash went with, Larvitar(all laugh) Oranguru almost gets the brat(all laugh) evolves in Pupitar(all laugh) then still Oranguru gets him and finally i think now Ashey-boy..hmm..(all laugh) and his wife namecalls him like nothing(all laugh) and it was 14 minutes and my Oranguru just about was able to get him then finally comes out mega-Tyranitar form direct(all laugh)..but thank God that the Unovan Tyranitar or the current one wasn’t then(all laugh)..the whole world was shocked to see double evolution and then comes a so rare and elusive psudeo-legend with direct mega evoluted form(all laugh) and what a sight that was my Oranguru tried to get inside the ball(all laugh) and Ashey-boy was unemotional(all laugh) his wife was namecalling Tyranitar now(all laugh) who probably was threatening her saying who’s your beau(all burst into laughter) and now would’ve politely asked Oranguru how’s today’s lunch 1/1107 th boiled(all laugh) and the rock gym specialist couldn’t understand how can a rock type beat my Azumarill(all laugh),well neither did humans(all laugh)..anyway Oranguru tryes the psychic blast stuff has to and with that size Tyranitar shows extreme pace and the whole place was as if had an earthquake and bodyslams Oranguru(all laugh) this is 16th minutes next 5 takes 10 minutes(all laugh) i sent Aerodactyl in and Tyranitar is quicker of course(all laugh) so pierces him apart then i realized my game is up almost cause next in was Madgaleo(all laugh) then Marshadow(all laugh) so i send Azumarill to get the water advantage and she is killed almost after getting bodyslammed(all laugh) no that was inhuman really(all laugh) then Tapu Koko goes in no electric attack works Tyranitar uses spite a ghost attack all time(all laugh) then Tapu Koko is torn apart(all laugh) then i get my last weapon as Golem and Golem is sent flying out of stadium(all laugh) then i knew i will change profession(all laugh) so went with Dusknoir to fool around(all laugh) which isn’t tolerated at all(all laugh) finally even scares Dusknoir of all pure ghosts(all laugh) then dark attacks and she was off with a tail whip(all laugh) and Tyranitar totally decimates everything on the battlefield as well during the match and then after match was wanting my whole bunch(all laugh) then with that size jumps Ash(all laugh)..and still Ashey-boy no emotions lets him jump(all laugh) and i knew which college i’ll go to(all laugh)..went there to congratulate by not uttering the word(all laugh) first wife namecalls me(all laugh) and Brock tries to control the situation(all laugh),well wife was atrocious on husband during matches(all laugh) and afterwards ever was sitting on his head and i even next day said,Ash please marry that Gyarados she ashames us(all laugh)’,’yeah,my best friend sweet girl she is best friends(all laugh)’ anyway,then after match at night to my utter disdain Ashey-boy comes in,’um..Gary i’m sorry that you lost it’s just luck but you also were studing for 1 year to become a researcher,why do you think Oranguru got the upper hand over Pupitar(all burst into laughter) i mean my mistakes(all laugh)..and to my increase my plight i scoff at him by namecalling says,’please,you’re just emotional(all burst into laughter)..this is a serious matter(all laugh) i may get a Tyranitar against Donphan next round(all burst into laughter) yeah if now it’ll be on the roundess of everything(all laugh)...so i had to say that i’m sorry i need to go to washroom FOR LONG(all burst into laughter)...this brat is after me since 0(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “thanks professor(all laugh),now Lillie’s bunch(all laugh)...Kanto for 1 year,Orange for 6 months,starter Blastoise(all laugh) then had Cloyster,Pelipper,Crabominable(all laugh),Seaking finally Relicanth both of whom are sadly with Sharpedo(all laugh) got only 2 in Orange both similar type Seaking and Relicanth cause before them had Crabominable(all laugh) she,Blastoise and Cloyster are of any use in battles if we look back 17/18 years ago(all laugh) Mr Oak Mr Oak had Crabominable(all laugh) then Violet’s bunch of course(all laugh) start to end and beyond Mantine(all laugh) and then she isn’t a gym leader either officially cause she was in Orange only for like 2 months(all laugh) then finally(all laugh) a Mr Fox(all laugh) Mr Fox jumped into ocean with Marill which he’s no more rueing cause(all laugh) then had Venonat(all laugh) he is so unhappy(all laugh) and then had and released Dodrio(all laugh) Marill doesn’t know what is psychic and then the one and only psychothrombonosis specialist Scyther(all laugh) never evolves of course(all laugh) and at Venturiastrog there also was a Mr Jackal(all laugh) was in hall of fame for naivety(all laugh)despite his shortest stay so he’s a real record holder(all laugh)..so congratulations gentleman-human(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “well this pest is after me too with a Marshadow(all laugh) man 1st ghost and had to be a psudeo-legend(all laugh) and his wife sweetens it with Golduck(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “we’re mere insignificant servants of Xormnuhs(all laugh) anyway so at Venturiastrog i attended 2 lectures they thought i came from mars(all laugh) then had a few talks still has connections there as you know(all laugh)...spoiled a brat to my profession(all laugh)...not male though(all burst into laughter,.)...came up was a big fan her big bro was in it thus and was around 20 then,told her to just have a look at my Spiritomb(all burst into laughter)...7 months later heard dropped out being afraid of herself(all laugh)...went there may be 10 times total 20 days or so,a great experience really...Croftsbergstrog was two days before the final there(all laugh)..told them by plane but they knew i was lying(all laugh)..later went only once more..knew that all i need to do was to tell my brats to keep it legal(all laugh)...went there before had contacted VIA Professor Stanley,there met Professor Andrea Armstrong,brilliant lecture 1 hour on the difference between MIND and SOUL(all laugh)...talked to a few people there as well,all knew i was in the finals(all laugh),’um..Mr Ketchum aren’t you..’,’yeah sir/mam,i’m in the finals but i want to come into this my profession is not satisfying me anymore at all you see so it’s all right i’m already financially secured enough through it so thinking about a different way to spend the rest of time that i have left in this world’...very happy as usual(all laugh)...next day sees the final with more interest(all laugh)...and they only know battle sees what happens(all laugh)...Nivy gets in and they must know what Nivy is doing way better than me(all laugh)...and so on, Professory Stanley Hopsberg two lectures again differnece between I and MY (all laugh and .)..that made my gateway really(laugh) this was the second and the first was why i was so interested to continue and learnt all it was about the monastic stuff(all laugh) and their ways to differentiatiate BODY,MIND,EGO and SOUL(all laugh and .)...this took 7 days infact(all laugh)..the next was 3 days and then to confirm the first was Venturiastrog...and infact all of the lectures had monastic methods to differentiate these things but they asked why this particular stuff and i just said my grandpa’s little brother was a monk(all laugh) no really you know i couldn’t say my very neighbour uncle’s adopted second son is one(all laugh) and then his big bro so happily let me buy their place and annex it to the lab(all laugh) still have contact with Angus twice a month call or emials but one call for sure and mom too once a week infact still has contact and his little bro is the reason why i specifically chose that topic(all laugh),yeah coming to that later that was some experience with him...no as usual you know he saw Mist during Orange break when he was 8(all laugh) then by the end of Hoenn he was at Viridian(all laugh) only returned twice(all laugh) then since 11 to 16 jammed there Gary saw him may be twice as well(all laugh) used to come to Professor sometimes but was like once a week for vacation(all laugh) for 20 minutes during night(all laugh) then by the time i returned from Sinnoh he was 16(all laugh) and never interested as usual about anything(all laugh) and i just told him i too have a girlfriend for a couple of years(all laugh) when he was 14(all laugh) and the reply was best wishes for both of you(all laugh) and another time i asked are you sure you don’t want to come to this profession this when he was 15(all laugh) said again best wishes for your pursits,career and mostly happy life(all laugh) he met mom before he left and also did call me to send best wishes within a minute(all laugh) and Mist never saw him again(all laugh) after i returned from Hoenn he was at Viridian off course(all laugh) then by the end of Sinnoh i asked him at 16 that man i spoke with you six times in last 3 years and in last 5,14 times(all laugh) and mom in last 3,9 times(all laugh) and your own parents and bro 12 times(all laugh) whole world knows what you are waiting for(all laugh),’1 (all laugh)’,’well that i know surely only a month left till your special philosophy extention school finally completes(all laugh) but are you sure of it’,’for 3(all laugh)’,then i realized the number games(all laugh) had the customery talk of health news and family health news(all laugh) no that was a prolonged one cause then none of us knew whether this will be last or not he has ever been a person who won’t forget his roots and all you know but just that uncertainty and hardship of 7/8 years in training none knows whether he may survive or not cause he wasn’t very healthy at all but this concern again was wished away(all laugh) and then i talked on my journeys and victories and all and on everything else his best wishes(all laugh) and my best wishes were copied from him only(all laugh) and well he being at Viridian heard about Mist for sure(all laugh) and i did tell him that yeah Mist is my girlfriend and same best wishes for both(all laugh) this was after Frontier and just before i left for Sinnoh when he was 15(all laugh) then i told him that you saw her when i returned from Orange after first trophy only one girl ever for me cause she’s not a girl to me(all laugh) and she more than reciprocates this sentiment(all laugh),’it’s said and been heard that if the view is meticulously perfected and protected to the right path of truth and reality with dilligence the whole being is in a far happier journey no matter the position in particular cases best wishes for both of you(all laugh)’ then well when i went to Kalos he was 21 but in monastery for 5(all laugh) thus i waited for another three years to talk with him(all laugh) in the meantime his memories forced me to see that philosophy and all and then i get him after Johto Elite4 when i was in Orange Elite4 infact cause of my own conditions then(all laugh) mom said he did contact his bro himself after the 8 years and all and then my mom as well spoke to him,his mom and dad both had passed on by then sadly which still had no effects in him only once said before leaving that my own parents went i was 5,then grandparents by 9,then a few more by 11 and finally many by 13 that was it for me with deaths in next 1 year lets see where it ends and hence his attitude really(laugh) thus then also had no effects and was as usual in except he just firmly assured his bro to stay true to himself as much and the visible comes and goes only to and from eternity,which currently is being seen as restricted but in reality it’s not as it has been heard(all laugh) so this was there and all anyway,then i call and say do you have time,’wishing for most productivity(all laugh)’,i said,do you know what my pokemons say they say anger,you or the thought of anger or the thought itself or the cause of the thought which is the one(all laugh),’natural(all laugh),thought is universal and unrestricted as well as is being(all laugh)’,i said well i’ve read the abstruse monastic philosophy and all to sharpen my mind told a bit about things,’best wishes for future progress path is endless if vision is clear to make the travel enjoyable to the goal that is the eternity(all laugh)’,then that goes after that i called after i realized my and Mist’s real bond after that picture and then this before going to Kalos again to meet Lugias(all laugh) after that picture said do you have time i’m sorry that it’s my personal life’s story but i got something that is just so amusingly pleasing and real(all laugh),’have you recently married or so decided or expecting the future or all these have been there long ago if the last case then in advance the best fervant wishes and happy jouney together into future to eternity(all laugh)’,then i told him a bit about the feelings i had had in front of that picture,’truth ever is truely real and thus totally unrestricted by anything cognizable for everyone to assimilate but the persons who are hungrier as it’s been heard get the hunger quenched to the more satisfaction,best wishes for happy journey for both(all laugh)’ then after the show i called and said these things(all laugh),’truth if shown with truth truely invokes the truth in and of all,best wishes for your joint life journey(all laugh)’,then Mist spoke for 2 seconds(all laugh) same best wishes and good fortune to be able talk with a very successful person professionally and also someone who participated in a show with her husband to share the reality as felt to them with the world with due honesty(all laugh) much honoured to speak and best wishes for your journey forward together with your husband(all laugh) and that’s all(all laugh) then i told him about our situation,’a circle is ever a circle no matter the variable width if that is a ring(all laugh) and then if eternity doesn’t appear in and through one most dear as future but future is still dear as much to that as possible in mind if the whole universe unrestricted to any specificity is thus made own future till the end in eternity where all and the specific are found as well as own being and the joint being with whom the journey has been and then only joy and hapiness remains thus whole travel is of hapiness only and only(all laugh) considering the future has decided to dawn upon as the whole universe to join in your shared journey together best wishes for your happy journey together going forward(all laugh)’ and that really was funny yet made our day(all laugh)..so both he and Kalos lectures too that was some experience really...Professor Stanley as you know has good connections with me and he is 65 now will retire by end of this year and IS single by-the-way(all laugh) and so was Professor Andrea who was then 55(all laugh)..yeah married people as a career teaching those stuffs hard(all laugh)...Professor Stanley knows Mist now too and all the stuffs,was laughing when i told him about what i did(all laugh)..said send her to a nunnery to a different region in the beginning atleast or else none of you will be a monk or nun(all burst into laughter)...Mist was told about exactly what i was reading and doing there(all laugh) so she was taken aback a bit saying but i don’t want to be a nun in this life(all laugh) to which professor said just know how they flee from home(all laugh) cause I was only there to perfect the runaway methods(all burst into laughter) as plans for the next life(all burst into laughter) .....those days in university lecture halls were something..i straight went in sat in the absolute front row cause it was empty(all laugh)..that was general lecture anyone could come a and a few were there general people interested in philosophy and all and NONE from our profession of course(all laugh) then before start many knew me(all laugh) too stunned(all laugh)..i said formal career coming to an end getting old(all laugh) professor comes asks people why they are mobbing me(all laugh) then told of course the whole world watches the leagues(all laugh)..and unfortunately even if they don’t Tyrangaleoveltal they do(all laugh)..then recognizes me you’re Mr Ketchum Unova league title and also Sinnoh legendary title(all laugh)..i said by luck yes but after me there has been about 30 new Unova champs and 65 or 66 new Sinnoh champs(all laugh)..professor laughs at this saying no wonder you’re here(all laugh)..later people ask students and all as i went to library etc few too overjoyous i say study well(all laugh)..they ask that do you have any(all laugh) i ever had Greninja there to assist me(all laugh) and all knows Greninja too well there says something from the dragons(all laugh) i said can’t release dragons in university lecture room or library(all laugh)..then general people who were there says yeah we have or had a Pidgey or something(all laugh)..how do you battle them(all laugh) says it’s not that just tell them to do this and that(all laugh)..i say no you have to treat them like your family they aren’t like general animals they reciprocate to you as much that if you’re very honest with them they will give their best that is the basic of battling and the rest is your skill and knowledge..then says um..but anyone can do this(all laugh) why we couldn’t(all laugh) i said you have different skills that we couldn’t have same stuff like anyone can do a math problem if he or she knows the process but that doesn’t make a mathematician like the human(all laugh) same here all can battle and communicate and all but doesn’t make them professional trainers it’s about your interaction with them and their acceptance of you huge focus and a lots of factors mostly your persistence and being a family to them that’s not easy cause neither is it easy to catch them nor battle(all laugh) they need constant oiling to go with you and will only not use their own brains if they trust you that you know about their heads enough(all laugh) and if they don’t then battling isn’t possible cause they will turn on you(all laugh)..then later day they professor Stanley himself wanted to see a dragon(all laugh) showed him Noivern(all laugh) who fondled him and the few that were there then professor jokes that if you didn’t know them well they would’ve taught you in a choised way(all laugh) surely battling is hard(all laugh) i was thinking if only you could read what Nivy does for a living(all laugh)..then they said then are they like pets(all laugh) i said thousand times more intelligent pets so that you must take good care of them and one bit of lack of it they will get sentimental(all laugh) and a many are there that doesn’t want you to take care of them but to let them attack anyone they see(all laugh)..then they said yeah creaturs(all laugh)..that was fun really,anyway about the GREETING SPECIALLY MANUFACTURED(all laugh),and how Daisy 500 times heard it(all laugh)...so about the confronting conversations Daisy ‘mam(all laugh)

Ketchum beside Water and flower..hmmm...(all laughes)....first marriage then husband's role is being the boyfriend (all laugh)...hmm...(all laugh)..comes back tells sisters doesn’t know him(all burst into laughter)..hmm..(all laugh)...but calls him mom(all laugh)..hmm..personally Profesaional...hmm...(all laugh)...and the Professor's soulmate only thinks..hmm...(all
bursts into laughter)..."
Ash(laugh) : "i see Lillie ‘mam,thanks..hmm...(all bursts into laughter)...but,most cherished crook(all burst into laughter)...what happens to the stricken-flower(all laugh)?.."
Brock(laugh) : "by the end of Johto i told both that,Listen you've 5 years ago crossed that age(all
bursts into laughter)...settle down have a family(all laughs)...hmm...(all burst into laughter)...so then they finally have to depart and on that day of departing is a novel by itself(all laugh) the flower was actually saying that Cerulian and Pallet is hell and heaven so that she may not the stricken boy again and so on(all laugh)...i was trying to flee the scene as quickly as possible(all burst into laughter)...cause the flower was desparate to fondle the boy that day(all burst into
laughter)..too sweetly,too closely,too tenderly(all burst into laughter)....but the boy here plays a
Master Trick,which ungentlemanly uncanny fox-man(all burst into laughter),please reveal to us
this stricken boy's wicked tricks in your cunning ways(all burst into laughter)which are compared
via beauty(Tracey bursts into laughter,Ash also laughs).."
Tracey(laugh) : "so this stricken boy, beautiful boy,beautiful boy(all bursts into laughter)...so the not physically beautiful flower(all burst into laughter,Misty uncontrollably laughs,Ash laughs uncontrollably as well) beautifully tries to beautifully fondle this beautiful boy(all burst into
laughter) but the beautiful boy beautifully shields by beautifully playing the beautiful card of
beautiful better-friendship (all laughes uncontrollably)..and beautifully keeps the beautiful crook from beautifully fleeing the beautiful scene(all burst into laughter)..please that bit(all laugh)...
Brock(laugh) : “first Misty in the pokecentre itself was trying to propose(all laugh)..by herself(all laugh)...then somehow both best friended it out as Ash said lets go home first(all uncontrollably laugh)...thus he beautifully tells the flower
that she can go her way he'll go his way and so on..the flower sang a song that day which the
words were later changed by her and the song is an international sensation by now(all laugh and
.)..besides we're doing everything but Viol what's your wisdom is saying on the Cerulian reaction to this night (all burst into laughter)..?"
Violet(laugh) : "what night this comrads Cerulian (all burst into laughter)/we must very first fondle
this sweet cute Ketchum(all burst into laughter)/comrades we never knew the young flower dream(all burst into laughter)/was hiding such a beau with her(all burst into laughter),whoose
language though is a bit obscene(all laughe uncontrollably)...so this was the review but now this should be gentlemanly-jackald out(all burst into laughter).."
Tracey (laugh) : "right thanks for singing(all laugh)..now the blossomed-but-that-day-stricken flower(all laughs) of course gives some memorabilias like a too adored handkerchief (all bursts into laughter),or innumerable too stricken pictures later(all bursts into laughter)...but those we know so lets follow the boy,so this beautiful boy beautifully returns to his beautiful home(all burst into laughter) and he then beautifully comes to the beautiful Oak Lab,'um..Mr Skechit,hey Ash..what happened man...'hey namecall don't pester me(all bursts into laughter),'um,Ash everything alright,no,Mist had to go home after so many..anyway..(all laughes uncontrollably),just give me the Cerulian city Gym's number,i demand to see my best friend immediately (all laugh) and if Mist changes her number and can't contact me and you slyly sitting here at the Lab don't do anything(all laugh),then your Scyther will chop your head off(all laugh)...so the beautiful boy beautifully phones to his sweet sweet flower and besides when they vedio called the screen was ever treated as a hindrence (all laugh),anyway,after that conversation i'm threatened to death that if i don't keep an eye on his flower as people can try to spoil his flower(all laugh) especially if they were young female unmarried vultures(all burst into laughter)...so i had to and that was something as well..'.. here's your badge,aww!My Ash is in that gym now(all burst into laughter)..um,thanks 'mam for the
badge but who's Ash..'you idiot get out,why are you even standing here,my Ash needs to concentrate(all laughs)...um..sorry...but..what would Ash be doing now...(all bursts into laughter),then we went to hangouts...'Trace carefully follow that namecalled in that far corner...(all laugh) isn't she trying to get too close to my Ash(all laughe uncontrollably)..?..'..'Misty
please,Ash is in Hoenn..'..'um..Hoenn..um..why this place too can't be in Hoenn(all laughs)..'...'Trace,Trace,look at the other side of the road..that boy..Hey Ash!(all uncontrollably
laughs)...'...so this went on,but the cunning crook(all laugh)..what was happening in the other
way so that we may get a better view?"
Brock(laugh) : '...hi!Ash!..yeah,yeah,enough(all bursts into laughter)...say...'..'um..may we..','i don't
think your motives are noble,please leave (all bursts into laughter)'...this was once after 60th
badge in a competition and otherwise would ask like 'hey, isn't that Mist(all bursts into
laughter)...this girl is cute,right hey Brock, isn't she Mist(all bursts into laughter)...'3 on 3,7th gym
badge..water gym...yeah, so  the Gym Leader Mist(all bursts into laughter)...then morning
wakes up,'hey,Mist'(all laughes)...um..sorry...but is Mist sleeping now too(all bursts into
laughter)'..and yeah a certain handkerchief was kept in the inner chest pocket all the time(all
laugh,cheer)..and that was obviously too adored at night by not adoring(all laugh) all he did was to cover his face with it it for 5 minutes after waking up each day(all laugh)..anyway,then mumurs 'yeah,but,i had a dream and Brock i saw Mist(all burst into laughter)..'Ash,come to terms,she's at Cerulian...no you don't understand... she's Mist (all laughes)...nice name..(all burst into laughter)..um..very sweet name..um..so sweet..um..just sweet name(all bursts into laughter)...",'Ash,why don't you tell her and start a relationship...'relationship?...why? she's my Mist(all burst into laughter)..um.. means best friend Mist(all burst into laughter) but Crawdaunt vs Swampet(all burst into laughter) i said man plase anyone but that utter brat(all laugh)...then later in Sinnoh far worse but that comes later and Hoenn has many more left but this was just to give the after Johto part which by current standards if a certain bike was kept at Viridian,the very first sight of that bike and the whole city would've got thunder-chaired(all burst into laughter) with of course Gengleye and etc doing the rescue operations(all laughe uncontrollably)...and this is just amusing cause Giratina and Ultranercozma was there with Gengar, practised and then even at practise you know what it is(all laugh)..no they are why Oak Lab is what it is simple(all smile and then laugh ) ,anyhow just hope they don't appear in our room here(all burst into laughter)...so,anyway the
boy was so stricken by the end of Johto that he wasted one month (all laugh) and then was
demanding that his flower also comes with him
during battles cause if someone else hands him
over the pokeballs he feels sweetened (all burst
into laughter)...and the flower of course was trying
to sit on his shoulders all the time(all burst into
laughter) and so on...but the flower was down
with her antics now that she was blossomed,
something happened (all burst into
laughter)...right Master...(all laugh)
Ash(laugh) : "well,she's trying to gag me now(all
burst into laughter)... it's ever perfectly and
Mistyviously done(all  .,cheer for
Misty,Misty blushes and lightly smacks Ash,who
laughs even more)... including smacking...(all
burst into laughter)..."
Brock(laugh) : "right,so the flower blossomed to
become too Misty(all laugh) and was wanting the
boy now to do his antics to please her(all
laugh)...in these days the if i told the boy call her
to come to dinner,the boy won't return obviously
(all burst into laughter),so i had to go and they
were too fondly looking at each other holding
hands of course(all laugh) to have any idea where
they were standing (all burst into laughter),and yes
this time hand holding was sometimes well all times getting supplimented by too-sweet-
but very quick-hugs(all laugh and .)...so this went
on in the last days as they could stop hugging each other before ages(all laugh) and the boy in these days became ferocious actually if someone looked at
his flower(all laugh)...i was ordered to make sure that except me there's no boys around her seat in
a specified circle (all laugh)...and Ash,for all
Unova, remember those after battle parties in
Johto(both laugh)...?
Ash(laugh) : "
yeah,by the way the flower blossomed and the boy
beed around also has a reason cause certain
unmarried female brats were misbehaving (all
laugh) and the flower was up in arms with them all
the time buying the boy the precious time to flee
the scene (all burst into laughter)...then Mist
dawned upon the flower(all laugh) in literal terms
that why do all brats want to fondle with 'my Ash'
by looking at him which sentiment was a bit more
than reciprocated(all laugh),but then the actual
Mist came in,who has dawned upon my shoulders
here(all laugh and .) and the flower was during
too close antics(all laugh) coming too too close(all cheer),winking and smirking
more(all .s and cheer for Misty) thus the boy
realized that it's finally time to bee around as
before he absolutely would’ve been hugged to death but also would've been booted(all uncontrollably laugh)...so now
the beeing around started but now the boy had a
big adventage that he could hug the flower
without any shoes (all laugh)...by the way shoes
were always a great excuse(all laugh) either my
shoe or my flower's hardly were alright in most
parts of Johto outside cities so on trekking though
plane lands(all laugh),also because we were
picking up sudden obvious injuries(all laugh),we
were helping each other to walk(all laugh)
together(all  .)...now the span of
hugging which the flower was desparate to stretch
to 24/7(all laugh) to which the boy always wanted
just a second more(all . and cheer for Ash and
Misty)...and the thing about deep night pin drop let
me clear(all laugh),cause that part only the crook
once saw out of may be 365*5 occasions(all
laugh)..and these are cause all those parts have been laughed off already by us cause of our marriage now(all . and smile)..and that day was the least special day,just
both went up almost at similar time and was
saying that the rooms weren't good cause it
wasn't a dormitory (all burst into laughter)...and after that occasion till Mist was with us even in
Hoenn reunion always in dormitory (all laugh)...
unmuked female fearow isn't good(all bursts into
laughter)...so deep night version is that...
'um...Mist,today..the sky is..um...clear(all burst
into laughter)...'stupid jerk!go to bed...','um...','Ash,let
me sleep,2:45(all burst into laughter)',so would
wake up at 2:45 many times for 8/9 minutes or
so but never 10 cause then we won’t be able to sleep again(all laugh),just go to the window hold the hands all the time later no too
prolonged hug(all burst into laughter) and 'your're
my better friend'(all burst into laughter) again
come back and sleep if pillowes were
used,'um..Mist,this one's not good,my neck
pains','yeah,mine too, too soft'(all burst into
laughter,.) then were automatically exchanged
without a word(all laugh),but somedays that
stretched to 70 minutes(all laugh) as well if we
were fresh and slept at noon or could do so next day(all
laughe)...just pokemon discussion of course (all
laugh)...then 'Mist,you look rather better in
ponytail(all burst into laughter) more so cause Ponyta..sweet Pokemon..(all burst into
laughter),then 'um..Ash,umm...a bit dark
tonight'(all burst into laughter),which is hold my
hands too tight(all burst into laughter),well she's
doing it for herself now..(all laughs)...and this is
when i was beeing around later parts we'll hug for
long and then in the last few weeks actually my flower
was tendering my hair too and me the ponytail(all
burst into laughter) a little while hugging but one day it really went to extreme and this was before the championships started just as we entered the place and a few girls were there which you know(all laugh)..so she didn’t like it and i was even more ferocious cause a few half-maled brats were too dumped to behave properly(all laugh),but i you know sometimes laugh that i had such protection with my bro(all laugh)..anyway i directly tell her that this isn’t good just let’s go cause really that bunch wasn’t good cause the great Johto Wisdom said invite as many people as possible through relations and all in the beginning...but then as soon as the competition begin too strict..authorities are greatest legends,each month something new(all laugh)...anyhow my flower ever liked it when i asserted her something very firmly and especially if that was that i wanted to talk about something alone(all laugh)...so she just reciprocated and held my hands and was trying to keep her head on my shoulders as well(all laugh)..which i said don’t do it’s a public place people will pester us so she didn’t do that but did all else to tell people about it(all laugh) but i was serious that day cause in my whole career and all that that was the worst brat gathering i saw cause they were nonchalantly trying their hands at dancing and all which included both haf-male and half-female version which i saw again at Johto Elite4 time but then i was 33 and international VIP with world-dreaded name and my Chu-bro(all laugh) so very little was there in front of me though i did tell them to chide them at each gym to behave properly cause i could see a few brats didn’t learn what their genders were ...anyway,so then that gathering i just went in 20 minutes or so get off and at my behaviour cause i never had to do it my bug was all over me anyway then we came back and then i just said that the another day left where such mingling happens i’m not going to go,so after this my flower hugs me instantly and i too followed suit immediately(all laugh)..but now...just imagine this scene(all laugh)..we were looking at each other fonding our hair and hugging and then during the conversations barely were not close enough(all laugh) and we’re looking into each other’s eyes the conversation was.. 'Ash...um...why do boys look at girls’(all laugh uncontrollably)'...'no just a normal
stuff i guess,but for me still this is MYSTRY(all burst into
laughter)...' ,’um..Ash,do i look nice today’(all burst into laughter),’yeah,very nice Mist,you’re my best friend(all laugh)’ and then she reciprocates and we hug for a bit too long(all laugh)...i’ve got no idea how we didn’t confess that day and that moment lasted just for a few seconds but the hug lasted may be 10 minutes(all laugh)..but actually the next day we realized that it was too much(all laugh) and thus stopped the hair fondling for ONE FULL DAY(all laugh) anyway, we were very close to confessing
in the first day itself (all laugh) but the whole trouble was we didn’t have to cause we didn’t need those words and thus never had those words either while we were together at all it was just the grasping of things that took it’s time(all smile)...but you
know,the play is the play(all smile)...anyway the
after battle parties at Johto were all formal since
round of 32 everywhere else its only semifinals
and final,except Orange cause the more the people the more the honeymoon customers(all laugh)..and Johto you know get all buffons in then play the hardman stuff(all laugh)..
'Mist,i must go there alone, friends aren't
allowed,'friends,friends(all laugh)...hum?..so many
cute cute girls isn't it?(all laugh)...either i'm going or you'll be
in deep waters (all laugh)..friends..(all laugh)..so i somehow manage her by our special-quick-hugging(all laugh) and all the time holding her hands and all that that i’ll be back soon(all laugh)..to which she has tears in her eyes almost..’um..Ash,we’re best friends right?(all laugh)..’more than great friends Mist(all laugh).please.i’m going .now,will return soon’(all laugh)..really i don’t know why i didn’t buy the ring anyway cause that was 21 years old marriage(all laugh)..but Crook(all laugh), how was the speculation over me being all alone in front of unmarried,dumped or divorced misbehaving fully non-male brat glare(all burst into laughter)..."
Brock(laugh) : " well comes in with little tears(all laugh)..sees me and other people,quickly goes into Gyarados mood(all laugh)... 'huh!.. friends not allowed,friends,friends..family..(all laugh)...um..
anyway (all laugh)...hey Brock,are there too many girls there(all burst into laughter)...now again shivers a bit..’couldn't he say i'm his second cousin(all burst into laughter),then when saw a few participants on semi final would go there and especially our sweet sweet Melody who beat Ash in
the semi-final and went on to become champion and Ash praised her a lot and really a lot for 15 years(all laugh)..Ash,we know the present state but just asking..how was Safforn ?(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “so great(all burst into laughter)...impersonally balanced but was violated(all burst into laughter)...i’ve had contacts with her since then itself(all burst into laughter),which wasn’t disclosed to my flower(all laugh),cause then Melody’s home would’ve been raided(all burst into laughter)...but you know i from day one was rather firm that only professional talks and thus obviously i know absolutely everything about her(all laugh),because she was like that this that may be in a 9 minutes talk 2 minutes must be personal..but about my personal life she was at total loss(all laugh)..to her i was a great competitor and then afterwards a few discussions were helpfull and all..so besides Brock you said you never saw me keeping female contact(all laugh) long enough except my sis,my flower and my lady Dawn(all laugh),that my beau will be my flower and not from outside people(all laugh) but you see Brock,this is playboy mastery(all laugh)..this art Brock,this art,of deceit,of veil,of contacts,of,beautiful vultures(all burst into laughter)...how the hell did you not know about atleast 300 female brats or venerables i had contact with and now its 3000(all laugh)..?..”
Brock(laugh) : “seeing the Mist everywhere goes the sight(all laught)/keeping the handkerchief in poket left to right(all laugh)/talking an hour constant with a certain Cerulian might/told me that unmarried female brats never looked any bright(all laugh,.)..”
Ash(laugh) : “right,and that i was helped more during my separation through female brats rather than their male counterparts(all burst into laughter) which you said has a reason(all laugh uncontrollably)..”
Brock(laugh) : “well that was an illusion(all laugh) but the thing is that still it could be cause,Mrs Lillie Oak,please demonstrate your professional intuition(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “hmm..(all laugh)..hmm..Ashey-boy..hmm...(all burst into laughter)...breaking-up..hmm...(all laugh)..15 years marriage suddenly break-up not divorce(all laugh) philosophically quotes around(all burst into laughter)...hmm...(all laugh)...any male brat unless impersonal is sweraed around...hmm..(all laugh)...keeps contacts with female brats to use them to Haunter the grounds(all laughs uncontrollably)...hmm...(all laugh)...Ash,how did you manage Sabrina of all who knows everything about us(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “ yeah,Sabrina of all people were concerned about this break-up(all laugh)...that was the only time i thought she was scared actually(all laugh)...she you know most gentlely-not-cunningly(all burst into laughter)...’hi Ash,Misty...’(all laugh uncontrollably)...’Misty,which Misty i’ve got 3 PROFESSIONAL friends of that name(all laughs uncontrollably)’...then becomes grave..’um..sorry Ash,i just heard that one of your Misty named friends who is in the profession as a gym leader(all laugh)..was actually in Cerulian Gym,where she’s the Gym leader(all laugh)..i had to go there recently you know she has many water-psychic combination and knows me as long as you do(all burst into laughter),she was saying that she wasn’t happy with your behaviour inside the gym(all laughs uncontrollably)..”,’Sabrina please,everybody can’t lead a life like you,they can’t be so strong always,you know that those kinds need certain kinds of friends(all laugh)..’..and this all to get under her skin(all laugh)..’ ‘i only had professional contact with this Ms. Waterflower(all laugh)..and in the gym i went there today it was just that the helpers were misbehaving(all laugh)..and Ms Waterflower wasn’t in a good mood that we had a skirmish..now how i get to become the central attention of her is beyond my comprehension and you of all people,yes Ms Waterflower is a great name and all but you yourself are equal if not better(all laugh)..so i didn’t expect you to be a confident of this certain Ms Waterflower’s personal life and i don’t cause she’s a big star might’ve had a few issues and on some weak moments my name came up and went all over you about this,why are you so concerned about her personal life?such stars can never live alone like you they have many troubles,don’t bother about them and let’s not discuss about certain stars and their madness so please,let’s be professional i need to know...’ so thus i lectured her that she was way above and venerable than this Ms Waterflower subtly hinting that my own intensions aren’t noble for women of her status to mingle much with me cause i may at anytime go full force in linking her to all sorts of possibilities given my disdain for certain star’s private life(all laugh uncontrollably).. now she says, “hm..i see,15 years(all burst into laughter),anyhow you’re right Ash,why talk about other people’s break-up with ego clash and all..so,yeah your questions...’...no didn’t ever talk about it again(all laugh)...cause to her if 14 year marriage can break-up like this,our professional relationship of 6 years has absolutely no chance(all laugh) and of course she thought of ego and all so that was it..(laugh,all laugh)...no Mist,that Ms Waterflower never existed(all laugh)..” 
Misty(laugh) : “ahm!(all bursts into laughter)...my husband isn’t it Lil,my husband(all laugh uncontrollably)...Ash..um..can i sit on your lap?..(all burst into laughter).. ”
Lillie(laugh) : “all the gym leaders knew what you were doing in Cerulian Ash(all laugh)..the trouble was you trash talking and style,none had a clue what the reality was(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “style is professionally contradictory(all laugh)..well,during Elite4 here first i didn’t want to do Kanto at all cause i had 6 alreday and didn’t want to insult Lance cause those brats(all laugh)..and i could afford that cause this was my own region and i had qualified so if i wanted i could’ve not competed in it right now but had to finish later but with me(laugh) i didn’t need to do anything at all after the greatest boss laughed his cruelty off so i could afford it but Lance said it’s alright you come in and requested me and had to come and my bunch fooled around with every hall of fame gym and normal hall of fame people in all regions barring Kalos but Kalos i in normal journey had 200 hall of fame gyms so it was alright and to be honest you know why Charizard is so good,i did 3 hall of fame gyms per day for 4 days a week as a normal challenger so in 5 weeks 60 such gyms were done in Johto and Hoenn(all laugh) where during travel i only did 32 and 40 respectively that too all due to Brock cause he took 2 minutes to recognize Chu’s potential and the 2 more to see his bond with me and thus planned the whole journey and Mist too both of our careers really is shaped by him so Brock am i getting a rematch(all laugh) ?”
Bock(laugh) : “anytime the most naive(all laugh)...Kanto those two little pests didn’t know a thing except marrying each other each minute(all laugh) and one bugged me whole day on everything that he saw including pokemons and the other was pulling my ears(all laugh)..in Johto one said all must be hall of fame gyms(all laugh) and the other more than agreed with namecalls(all laugh) that it should 2 such gyms in a day(all laugh) with the stern warning that my ears won’t be attached to the right place anymore(all laugh) if there’s a namecall female gym leader(all laugh)..so i said alright you do 26 in Johto,’um..that’s too little Brock,i’m doing 76 gyms with 74 hall of fames(all laugh)’..i said that are you crazy,you anyway have to do  48 ok max 56 atmost with 23 hall of fame gyms and 27 competitions(all laugh)...and i really do want to give a view on that...says Brock,hang on you do the travel planning but i’m doing 76 gyms 74 hall of fame 36 compitions(all laugh) the 2 normals should be not even special category cause other’s may feel lonely Brock(all laugh) and chose the best ones for all categories(all laugh)...from the other side the other half screechs,’you lazy jerk(all laugh),make that 85-83-45(all laugh)’...always these two played with numbers(all laugh) cause they were best friends as spouses(all laugh),the husband says,’huh,only will travel around too much zeal(all laugh)’,’what was that Ash,huh,what was that,I WILL BEAT YOU IN EVERY WATER COMPETITION(all laugh)’...so this goes on(all laugh) and the wife does beat the husband in Whirl Cup semi final(all . and cheer for Misty)...in fact Feraligator and Togepi both were illegal battles(all laugh)...by the way Feraligator thank God didn’t go to the gym(all laugh)...and Misty had way more powerful water pokemons than Ash still does cause she has 3 psudeo legends Tapu Fini,Kaledo and Manaphy to none for Ash but sadly Ash has Crawdauntogatorler and Palkiarempras with Seismirottzel and most beautifully still has Glalie(all laugh) and still has 7 more chosen brats(all laugh) that is Abomasnow to begin with(all laugh) anything else(all laugh) and the other fight that 2nd badge was draw but Cerulian gym we all know(all laugh)..just as we’re seeing now decoration plans(all laugh)..and strangely Misty and Ash competed in 9 water competitions and faced each other 5 times and it is 3-2 as ever in Misty’s favour and twice Misty won the cup both were finals and another time was the semis which is Whirl and for Ash it has never been the final one was semis and one was 3rd round...the 3rd round was in Orange and the semifinal one was at Johto actually both time won the cup and Misty won one during Orange which the jackal thought both are married cause both are inhuman(all laugh),then she won again at Johto then Whirl she didn’t win..and Ash also has ever lost those three water cups other one being a Ground cup in Kanto to whom(all laugh) knows what is a pokemon called Gary Oak as Mr Oak(all laugh) another was a Psychic cup in Kanto to Melody of course(all laugh) and returned the favour in Orange once too little once too egotistic so Melody only became professional friend after Johto(all laugh),and that Kanto psychic was Mime’s only cup after that was demoted(all laugh)...first first time Misty competed in two Kanto cups she didn’t know anything except psybeam and watergun(all laugh) but in Orange the first cup Ash won and Misty he beat in 3rd round, next Misty won then Johto first cup Misty won both were finals beating Ash and then Whirl and it’s most remembered cause their match was once in a lifetime stuff really and Misty managed to beat Ash and then was runners up and then last one in Johto Ash won the cup and against Misty in semis that was it till he broke-in(all laugh) but just to marry Misty again for 35th time(all laugh) and in Kanto,Ash strangely won both water cups with Squirtle,Kingler and of course that brat Abomasnow(all laugh) but in Orange he won 2 the other his other half won(all laugh) and then in Johto won 2 out of 4 one his other half again won(all laugh) and Hoenn was Crawdaunted(all laugh) with Sharpedo and Glalie(all laugh) Kingler as you know was an extremely good against any psudeo-legend and she did beat a Palkia in first region(all laugh) it’s just ever with dragons they can’t beat master pest’s pests(all laugh) Kingler with so much restrictions in agility on some ground more water type battlefield,won against a Palkia but our Palkia is better not spoken of(all laugh) and he was with none other than Crawdaunt in Unova none are sane now who had to host these two(all laugh)..
and Squirtle beat Kyogre of all pokemons(all laugh) and Abomasnow had beaten Kyurem(all laugh)..all first region(all laugh)..but Ash,first all loses were to people too known to you and Melody you came to know much later but still she is such a name here still and then did help your hallucinations(all laugh) but then always great to lose special water cups to own wife(all laugh)..”
Ash(smile,hugging Misty very firmly smiles at her,Misty also hugging Ash firmly smiles at him and rests her head on Ash’s chest,then Ash keeps tendering Misty) : “everytime to my toffee-flower(all laugh)...no really you know we competed in 5 total directly and infact these are barring her own water cups that she had to as a gym leader(all laugh) and everywhere there were Kyurems(all laugh) cause same competitions just the section was different and in our section damn brats like Mark has faced her(all laugh) but he used Goodra in water competitions(all laugh) anyway, there she has done 30 in Kanto(all laugh),18 at Orange(all laugh) and then Johto she already had qualified so was in general cups with us and did 24 still(all laugh) and her record is in Kanto was just a little girl won 13 out of 30 in Orange won 17 out of 18(all laugh) so total 30 out of 48 and Johto won 22 of 24(all laugh) and so total was 52 of 72 which is huge with 2 general cups and still was renouned name in Johto to an extent many knew her as well and both were subject to many speculations together and except as well(all laugh) i knew those brushed them aside and kept her firmly under my grip cause first she doesn’t know anything about shakehands STILL(all laugh) and second she is my wife since 16(all laugh) and Mist never understood those in the sense that just laughed them off UNLESS it was about me there just said good friends but stammered in a few places(all laugh) then was barred from press(all laugh)..and her winners parties i was with her each time of course forced in by Orange title(all laugh) and in Orange it was ok she was 18-19 still Trace was sent as the buttler(all burst into laughter) and Mist fled each party after 30 minutes where Trace infact was more frank to people but was threatened to not act like Muk ELSE MARSHADOW(all laugh)..in Kanto we all were allowed and they anyhow were just 1 hour long that too just semi final and final main stuff was on the first day then one match then next day 3,then semi final and final and that was main anyway,there Trace how was the experience(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “well spoke with a few people but fled as soon as personal questions are asked like which school did you study in(all burst into laughter) then i was fed to them and ever ran away from parties and husband in that time was reading philosophy books or listening to lectures(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “yeah would run back and straight chiding me(all laugh) and while i was training was namecalling me when i studied and all else she trained sometimes or i as you know barely trained them they had to answer questions figuring themselves out as did i at the same time(all laugh) and so studied for some times to prepare questions and then just having fun with them MENTALLY(all laugh) and so on during those times absolutely in negetive circles even then(all laugh) said no i like you..um..your methods(all laugh)..so so sweetly ponytailed Mist Gyarados(all laugh) Mist was so sweet then mom said,’um..honey do you protect her(all laugh)..’,cause once spoke with mom then in Johto i had a bit of a name already and she was good so had a bit of name as well and hence mom cautioned me and also her to be aware of pests and so on Mist said,’um..it’s ok mom,Ash handles these things well,Brock is also there it’s ok and i’m alright with my Ash..um..(all laugh)..um..Ash takes good care of all of us..um..(all laugh)..’,so mom said that i said my best friend is totally blind to these things she’s fine and yeah i look after my best friend(all laugh),’yeah nice to know and do better(all laugh)’ so that was that and Mist is ever so sweet Gyarados(all laugh,Ash hugs Misty very firmly smiling at her,Misty same pose smiles at him)..and yeah losing to my wife always so special cause her frowns midmatch are so sweet(all laugh) and Mr Oak Mr Oak is specialist in ground type muscles(all laugh) no those ground type brats spoiled him(all laugh)..Magmortgolem(all laugh)..and Melody is Melody really always is but i still remember Whirl Cup that was 2nd water in first she won beating me in semi final infact(all laugh) that was Arctarau Cup and Whirl was same in third i again beat Mist but by then i was so much submerged in her longing for me that i felt too bad(all laugh)...i was extremely distracted cause she was frowing and was so so sweet(all laugh)..couldn’t stop just losing myself with her at opposition end,Mist was screaming something i could only recall(all laugh)..i was just looking at her nothing else(all laugh)..so sweet her scowls(all laugh)..then i saw Feraligator evolved into Feraligator(all laugh)..and he was just too strong that day,Psyduck first time fought seriously after 5 years(all laugh)...and he knew 1 attack Psychic but no watergun(all laugh)..but just too great with Psychic and exactly why Mist chose him cause didn’t want that brat in final(all laugh) and Croconaw evolved only to fondle everyone more(all laugh)..and Croconaw had beaten Jellicent and Manaphy before that without ice beam(all laugh) then becomes Feraligator and dances on Psyduck’s head with that size(all laugh)..he goes absolute mad and tries to go to maximum and then Feraligator again the same trick too quick and all just wins but i was not dejected exactly but was like after match handshake(all laugh)..and i wanted to hug Mist so much(all laugh,Ash quickly hugs Misty whoose on same pose smiles at him,Ash and Misty smile and each other then same pose)..and that after the day that was semis i then win the final then she as ever the hidden big sister in congratulations(all laugh)...loathed that stuff(all laugh)...then at night i hugged her and KEPT HUGGING HER(all laugh)..she too gleefully followed suit(all laugh) that was penultimate competition and last water so i DEDICATED second time(all laugh)..that was it for me,actually that cup the Noahland Cup was confession itself(all laugh)...and Mist didn’t say more that 2 words(all laugh)...that was my last battle with my wife till i broke-in her room(all laugh)..and that day she was so sweet as ever when angry and had i not had gloves on,i would’ve hugged her to death and proposed her on that spot itself(all laugh)..but that brat Fabina cheated,whoose her husband,how many the beaus(all laugh)..well with many cases reopening 2 years back should’ve got her too(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “well i only hope this Feraligator comes nowhere near me(all laugh)...and he has a comrade across lives(all laugh)..anyway,so that was Johto then goes to Hoenn,i joined later but his chart was, these all is total gym hall of fame and competitions,i still remember May was a sweet little kid didn’t understand a thing her big bro said on pokemons(all laugh)...then Mr Maple was consulted,general Ash had to do 48-26-36,Mr Maple talked with him and learnt the previous list 76-74-36 of course(all laugh) and all said alright,80-78-40(all laugh)..Ash hands me over the list,96-96-45(all laugh)..i said mate are you sane,none does 45 competitions(all laugh)..and none has does 96 hall of fames(all laugh)..and none does all hall of fames in 4th region(all laugh)..um Brock,i see,still less than 100 hall of fame gyms you know bad thing(all laugh) and what if a Ninetails vs Feraligator(all burst into laughter)..i said anything but that pest(all laugh)..since Hoenn he himself chose the gyms as well in Johto i did that and Hoenn just the review and i had to plan the schedule which had absoluetly no breaks(all laugh)..if breaks were spoken of it was said the thought current never halts(all laugh) epsecially if one knows the next isn’t a rest day(all laugh)..but our little sis even at 16 and half still tried her best to follow us without one word and Max was 13 then(all laugh),still the same that little kid,had to travel on transports though most times(all laugh)..transports are Pelipper,Talonflame and Solgaleo(all laugh) and Solgaleo was fed to me and Max(all laugh),if rivers and so on had Sharpedo and none other than Crawdaunt(all laugh) and that brat always ferried me and made me wet and tried to kill me by drowning(all laugh) said this distribution is to cmbine your ideas as recombinations against the idea that you’re not of any type(all burst into laughter) which opposing both will mean you’re just so naive(all laugh) i asked him in Sinnoh do you understand why you battle(all laugh),yeah,this distribution is important to understand the combining factors opposing the ideas of master brat exactly which he tries to counter as seen at work,on hand stuff that is(all burst into laughter) i understood these brats will create a mayhem on the last region and they did(all laugh) but in Frontier again i had Feraligator(all laugh) who tried to turn water pokemons on me(all laugh) said you’re idea of yourself in progress is ever hindered by that very idea(all burst into laughter) hence you must plan to turn on against everything opposing your that idea which then will sprout to become stronger then only you will oppose that to see that all ideas that don’t oppose themselves are illusory(all burst into laughter) i once asked him at Frontier where he was asked abstruse questions by his master brat(all laugh) i asked do you understand the difference progress and regress(all laugh),yeah one looks forward cause the back is opposite and the viseversa(all burst into laughter)..so i realized this is an absolute damn brat(all laugh),Max always had Sharpedo who was ever there in Hoenn and Frontier then again in Unova and Pelipper got May and Ash ever on Talonflame,at Frontier we had Charizard too sometimes and hence May and Ash always went way ahead of us and i ever had that brat Solgaleo and then those two water pests(all laugh) and i and Max went a day later thus(all laugh) and Max beaked my head off with all sorts of questions on how to ride on Dialga(all burst into laughter) now will be the opposite infact(all laugh)..Sinnoh always on air travel with Pelipper,Talonflame and/or Charizard and when Charizard wasn’t there i was fed Mantine of course(all laugh) and this brat pestered me on this issue and lady Dawn used to chide me at 16 taking Viol’s side and both of us were 31(all burst into laughter)..then in Hoenn May in the beginning 3 months may be did complain a bit but that too only cause too long lunch please extend it in daydreams(all laugh) after that it was said you will eat more at night(all laugh) then was fine after that absolutely no complains what-so-ever and even encouraged us saying we should move on and if we don’t she will ALONE(all laugh)..always had company though(all laugh)..then later in Frontier herself became battle-reddened(all laugh)..and our rose couldn’t follow us in Frontier and faced those questions and his rose herself was battle reddened(all laugh)..really he faced at the age of 19 things that were heinous(all laugh)..in Hoenn her big bro was battling sanely still(all laugh) while asking questions(all laugh) and then after that more questions and so was she was shocked at first(all laugh) and then told her dad(all laugh) Mr Maple when we met again was just in hall of fame Pettlesberg was our very last(all laugh) Mr Maple was in hall of fame just for a month then(all laugh) and what a match that was i still remember Mr Maple chose first Sivally(all laugh),Pyroar(all laugh) and still Regigigas(all laugh) and Ash went with Typhlosion(all laugh) then had Snorlax(all laugh) but the last was Madgaleo(all laugh) and 2+ only mandatory that against a hall of fame the leader will go toe to toe but this pest of course 1+ and compelled everyone(all laugh) since Johto ever asked best pokemons only i won’t change(all laugh) and since Johto never once was defeated at all(all laugh) and no draws either(all laugh),last draw in Orange last loss in Kanto that too his first ever hall of fame gym against Blanie of all legends(all laugh) and Sivally won against Typhlosion comes in Snorlax who somehow beats Sivally then Pyroar sends him off in 1 seconds(all laugh) and Snorlax did fool around but the opponent was of same type so a bit hard(all laugh) and then comes the one and only Madgaleo(all laugh) a type advantage but Ash from beforehand told this choise without the order which he did since Unova finals only(all laugh) and his choise was told since Hoenn itself without order all thought what an egotistical brat exactly to invoke their wrath so that they go with best pokemons at best level(all laugh) but that’s the egotistical hall of fame others realized he just wants level grounds not emotional at all(all laugh) which is what he said before announcing(all laugh) and since Frontier said if loses won’t take badges at all(all laugh) this was cause it’s disrespect to gym leading as a profession(all laugh) Mr Walker at Blugreen City was laughing hearing this said man you will get both our and your profession in serious trouble if you get to authority someday(all laugh) this pest said,no just that idea anyone is alright that hasn’t won a title but why should a single time champ ask for favours unless he is still thinks that paper wasn’t clearly passed at special school(all burst into laughter laugh) so Mr Walker said yeah i get it just Tyranitar(all laugh)..and he said the same things to Mr Maple but too humbly but didn’t say anywhere at Hoenn that will not accept badge unless wins and told Mr Maple that he doesn’t have Pangoro this time and Primape or Tauros may be can beat one but not two no matter what the current opponent’s condition is so said i’ll have Solgaleo and Mr Maple was laughing saying atleast not Tyranitar(all laugh) so Madgaleo comes in neutral almost in case of Pyroar and sends off both her and none other than Regigigas cause none gets what is happening in his mind as he’s born(all laugh) and neither does he hence(all laugh) Regigigas of all pokemons was disadvantage against him(all laugh) so didn’t let Solgaleo charge at all(all laugh) stood there played mind games got under his skin and beat them(all laugh) and then Madgaleo after match jumped Ash as usual and then us too(all laugh) said this idea of a battle is such intriguing it veils the other needs like we ourselves(all brust into laughter),Ash said this means he realizes the progress in despondency at family loss just about to mitigate moment untransitional hallucinations(all burst into laughter) i just thought that Misty,may the infinite compassion bless your personal life(all burst into laughter)..and this pest used to read the excerpt of all sorts of heartbreak and berevement stories too(all burst into laughter) and all sorts of other emotions said see this idea being a pokemon and HUMAN(all laugh) must be erased mustn’t it Brock(all burst into laughter)..what do you say human(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “AH!INHUMAN IS HUMAN(all burst into laughter)..according to Kyurem that is(all burst into laughter)”
Brock(laugh) : “man Cilan said Kyurem at her full lunacy was asked what is a Kyurem(all burst into laughter),Cilan said first he was too well known by then no plan,no strategy,whole world of his known professionals knew everything about his strange questionsing methods cause they were beaked off by such questions(all laugh) and Cilan was told and his Goodra responded so much to this fondling(all laugh) so he knew this pest is an absolute brat of a pest(all laugh) anyway,then Mr Maple after that asked me does he have any clue of anything(all laugh) i said no you’re his uncle so too formal but the this pest later asked him,this transition phase between the rest and action as it may appear to us being continuous in mind one spot can’t be actually pointed out but your Pyroar despite being a fire type created a sort of a curtain to hide that sentiment where one is about to decide on the condition a sort of a confusion but that my Snorlax did try to gauge by telling her if she knows the distance between any branch of a tree to it’s root like the want to battle a bit harder just after getting started cause that idea on that occasion was suitable to be reacting to as enticing but it could be veiled as well anyway(all laugh) so this against the distance of cloud to cloud that is from one midpoint of a feeling to another Mr Maple my Snorlax didn’t get this thus lost so your Pyroar does she understand what is the exact middle of a feeling(all burst into laughter) Mr Maple later said i told him only when her hunger is in the latest distance from middle hunger she does(all laugh) and he asked me how many Ash lost except to the obvious(all laugh) May told Mr Maple day one bro has a grilfriend(all burst into laughter) so it was well known and also the fact that the girlfriend was absolutely blind and Gyaradosy(all laugh) May said even at Hoenn all formal big sis responsible talks but always no matter what,um..May,is your bro..is he..yeah your bro..(all laugh).. and ever mentioned Ash as your bro or he means she was married to him for ages(all laugh) and to us just after returning ever my Ash(all laugh) and by the last months of Hoenn Ash was too longing(all laugh) and anyway always said,yeah my Mist that’s my best friend(all laugh) we knew yeah that’s your wife(all laugh) but then during the last months forgot to say my best friend said yeah my Mist so sweet anyway(all laugh) we knew yeah that’s marriage 24th (all laugh) but hearing these didn’t appease someone(all laugh) who disdainfully said yeah horizon is virtually seen actually inexistent(all burst into laughter)..and his travel companion said,all are veils to make sure his wife uses veils and gloves while battling(all burst into laughter) anyway,Mr Maple asked whom has he lost to except his in-born other half(all laugh) i said once to a Gary Oak,Mr Maple said yeah Mr Oak right(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) and then Melody said well loses against only very own relatives then and Melody is just too good whole Hoenn knows her cause none wins 3 leagues with 30 pokemons out of which 25 are psychics(all laugh)..Ash Meldoy’s full bunch once(all laugh)..”
Ash(smile) : “yeah,Mrs Melody Sanders Harrison,starter Evee,later Espeon
full bunch 20 from Kanto including starter,4 from Orange,6 from Johto,6 from Kalos,4 from Unova total 40,
has,Victini,Chanedlure,Magnezone,Blaziken(all laugh) yeah that is something,Houndoom,Uxie,Mewostic,Metagross,Beeheeyem,Sableye,Magearna,Unown,Gengar,Reuniclas,Alakazam,Froslass(all laugh) AH! BEAUTY!(all laugh),Phione,Kaledo,Medichan,Zygarde(all laugh) not alone as lone(all laugh),Xatu,Noivern(all laugh) that too is something absolutely for sure indeed(all laugh),Solrock,Virizion,Diancie,Oricorio,Dedeme,Hypno,Meloetta,Wigglytuff,Salamence(all laugh) Gengarian philosphy master(all laugh),Muk(all laugh),Cacturne,Shiinotic,Girafarig,Altaria,Noctowl,Heliolisk,Golduck(all laugh) that’s just Mist(all laugh) and finally Zeraora(all laugh) Mr Oak Mr Oak why are you called Gary(all burst into laughter)..
Gary(laugh) : “yeah i’ll aske them why are you called brat then(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “professionally(all laugh) anyway,Melody got only Zygarde and Salamence from Unova along with Altaria and only Noivern from Kalos so Zygarde and Noivern are only that isn’t found outside of Kalos-Unova and participated in except for the mandatory ones always minimum gyms and rest were with mandatory 6 more total 8 psychic competitions(all laugh) 6 is to depict her name(all laugh) so yeah i know too much about her(all laugh) cause she should’ve been my travel companion at Hoenn i realize now and no not just my regrets that i should’ve done more for her but it’s just that next day i unveil my new travel companion to counter the Daisyl(all laugh)..so Daisy what would’ve been your countering plans then(all laugh)..
Daisy(laugh) : “well first love for pokemons card was played to snatch her away to her own home(all laugh) then that was to deal with her hubby(all laugh) then if hubby played sentimental tricks jackal would’ve been fed to him using horizon card(all laugh) and Doctor Slate would’ve been forced to stay here for 10 months using marriage as prize card(all burst into laughter)..”
Violet(laugh) : “actually it’s pretty true(all laugh),i contacted Doctor Slate who said distance is heavenly(all laugh) so i fed him to the master brat(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “everyone uses me(all burst into laughter)..”
Violet(laugh) : “this means..(all laugh)..”
All in Unison except Brock(laugh) : “AH!FEELING OF FAMILY!(all burst into laughter)..”
Brock(laugh) : “no this master brat has played me since first day(all laugh)..but jackal at Hoenn what about it master brat(all laugh)..yeah sis would’ve had a great time(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “Meldoy would’ve beaked the jackal’s head off with questions and all sorts of philosophies(all laugh) and that amount of battling inhumanity(all laugh) jackal at Hoenn would’ve been real fun as it would’ve been had Mist heard that Meldoy would be my travel companion next day after Johto parting and i would’ve said exactly the next day after not calling her that day of parting and next morning(all laugh) would’ve strainght came to my room here next day,Ash,how could you(all laugh) and that is just one word(all laugh)..’longing?’(all burst into laughter)..yeah Irene was saying that Mist well,was too Gyaradosy at school but in reality too nice but later was so gentle and self established we all realized very hard for anyone to get in a relationship with her(all laugh) but that was except me of course cause i knew what antics she did during Orange break at Pallet(all laugh) i said,yeah too sweet as you know in reality and all of that was only there as an expression of that sweetness but as soon as saw me and the rest was erased(all laugh) returned here the rest came back as a mask as you see now so happy(all laugh) says,yeah totally childish and blind(all laugh) i said hence too Gyaradosy(all laugh) and with me ever completely lunatic ponytail(all laugh) so yeah that would’ve been something had it happened(all laugh) but most fun would’ve been having Mr Oak Mr Oak at Unova(all laugh) with those pests and Mr Oak with them as Mr Oak would’ve been fun(all laugh)..but about Melody’s bunch yeah strange(all laugh) anyway,continue the feelings Doctor Slate(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “of that feeling(all laugh)..then Mr Maple said yeah Melody is a phenomena really and we all know her even more cause we thought surely here now went to Kalos(all laugh) i said yeah unless people let him fool around with them to absolute maxima they won’t understand him easily(all laugh) Mr Maple said i’m a bit old now(all burst into laughter) i said well in your case midmatch may ask you to teach him the difference between the desire to win and yearning to win as according to the varying proportion of want as appearing through words(all burst into laughter) he said no wonder May has become much matured now(all laugh) then his list of course 96-96-45(all laugh) and Mr Maple first did the list for him as 70-40-40(all laugh) then later after knowing the full list he was laughing to me in secret(all laugh)..said first came in learnt about everything and my own status and why the authority wasn’t allowing me the tag(all laugh)..i said normal types hard to get the tag many specifications..um..Mr Maple i’m sorry to learn that i hope you get the tag as soon as possible but who are the others that(all laugh)...his system is that if he knows someone he will find others and beat them by questioning them(all laugh) all to show that his friends or family is far better cause only there he had to comeback(all laugh)..i said it is cause we know you too well(all laugh)..um isn’t that the point the EMOTIONAL difficulties(all burst into laughter)..some brat this is AND THIS IS THE REAL BRAT THAT IS MAKING HIS BRATS DANCE TO HIS TUNES(all laugh)...then in Frontier City-as-villeges(all laughs)..well you can’t do the same gyms you did before unless you run out of options like 7th and 8th region as 6 and 7 time champ(all laugh) so in Frontier gives me the list,70-70-36(all laugh)..i said Ash you’re losing yourself you have to trek to get the pokemons first(All laugh),i see brock 579 days we’ll have 331 for trekking in a region which we already have travelled once and our own region so won’t you Brock(all laugh)..no,no it’s ok Onix has evolved and been a while so a Luxray vs Steelix(all laugh)..i said please man you need to train them as well(all laugh)..no this battle that i talk about with you i of course did so much in Hoenn is just that a productive discussion to refocus away from this difference that appears around us in nature(all burst into laughter)..i said,even for questioning them you need time(all laugh) i counter Brock thus i’ll question them during battles(all burst into laughter) hence so many gyms and competitions(all laugh) and hence i only speak about psychology HUMAN that is(all laugh) with them during matches(all burst into laughter) i need them Brock i need them to be me(all burst into laughter) don’t i(all burst into laughter) and as all of we 3 managers of this now 107 strong circus(all laugh) always say that no matter what may this brat say they are only following this brat nothing else(all laugh) not for no reason do they call him ring master brat(all burst into laughter)..then this meance continues(all laugh),and thus they must make me them Brock am i not exactly a Feraligator Brock(all burst into laughter)..and you understand that as this brat polishes their words to make them from totally meaningless to absolute heavenly as girlfriend(all laugh) pokemons are pokemons they are same nothing more no pokemon will ever ask for your age related issues(all laugh) THIS BRAT IS THE REAL ONE CULPRIT(all burst into laughter) then this brat goes on still(all laugh)..they need to be Ash Ketchum Brock and me a pokemon(all laugh) as a whole as general the word pokemon that is and they in the opposite direction gets me and then the general human characteristics as much as they can comprehend through me and then other(all laugh) i’m a manual to them Brock to penetrate into the human level and me the other way around isn’t this endeavour beautiful Brock(all burst into laughter) see i’m married now Brock the psychophysical despondency is much mitigated if not totally as transformed into actual Metaphysical appearence(all burst into laughter) but with time they will go down even more won’t they Brock(all laugh) i said,you need time to talk with your wife who isn’t a pokemon METAPHYSICALLY(all burst into laughter) and no matter that you’re married for 24 years you need to keep contacts with your wife atleast to know if she is alive or not NOT METAPHYSICALLY(all burst into laughter) said,yeah i realize that i wish i had my Mist with me,May is here Max as well you’re here as is Drew around somewhere(all laugh) but she should’ve been here you know really 3 sisters certainly could look after a Gym together(all laugh) you 3 have spoiled them Brock really(all burst into laughter) and catching pokemons Brock but why should i(all burst into laughter) i wish i could ask them to have a meeting with me to discuss on emotional matters like with a Magmorter they have feelings subtle emotional,complex,intriguing(all burst into laughter) their life don’t you know Brock(all burst into laughter) and you know this brat spoiled exactly a Magmorter and went to a dinner with Kommo-O at Huntelion and was guest inside a volcano with his Heatran who was more suspicious of him than her own family(all laugh) and then says catching pokemons Brock isn’t it say i will get 20 then in chosen regions(all laugh) you give 16.5 days to get total to get 330 and i have a day more don’t i Brock(all burst into laughter) anyway,sorry for this gibberish just the emotions(all laugh) so surely you’re coming right(all laugh) i said yeah cause if i don’t i’ll be the most foolish in next 75 years when i will be 104 thus will be starting at 16 just about next term(all laugh) but i quit philosophical discussions(all laugh)...that was impossible and these things this brat has told the whole world in different language(all laugh) and all of us many times but surely unless you have damn brats like Snorlax and Muk you can’t be jovial but still you know since day one this brat is the real master brat(all laugh) then in Hoenn our little sis was too little so scared first(all laugh) then she was babysitted to utmost(all laugh) do this,do that ask Brock on how to manage feelings(all laugh) ask him how to understand pokefeelings(all laugh) the right foods(all laugh) right things to do about trekking and so on and he will teach her everything about training but only that motivational talks all me(all laugh) but i was 10 years older to May so when too insecured would go to her littler big bro(all laugh) and he did the subtle motivational talks me the general(all burst into laughter) general means i’ll tell her to tighten your belt and be self established be couragious,sporting,generous,warm etc when needed but he will do the emotions as to this difference when you’re in the middle of a pain but just about to get mitigated like a you’ve forgotten to walk for a minute more before taking your meal to the hunger is that bit more thus releasing the maximum power of intake for better neutrition prolonging to be more satisfied,cunning(all burst into laughter) and you see why his starter is a brat now finally(all laugh) was trying to be normal Pikachu but finally realized that this is a true master brat so became the merchant of the art of starvation Chu(all laugh) this brat is the most dreadfully wicked culprit brat of this circus(all laugh) and he just sort of taught May about pokemons and all in that metaphysical perspective though(all laugh) making her sit on his lap while tendering her like a 6 year old baby(all laugh) and then at Frontier she was spoiled(all laugh) then in Johto tormented Drew to absolute maxima(all laugh) but during Hoenn break Ash told May look it will be 1.5 years and extremely hectic schedule think again and think about your rose too he will be at real bay following us(all laugh) May was adamant to follow her big bro no matter and infact then Mr Maple was informed of the schedule as well and Max too was asked who said far better that wasting time at school buildings(all laugh) and he was ready even at 15(all laugh) and May was too excited then so Mr Maple was called and he knew the amount of babysitting May receives despite the schedule(all laugh) said doesn’t matter your siblings entirely your responsibility(all laugh) so then the rose was told by May who was hellbent to know who her travel companion will be of course(all laugh) so himself told are you free for Kanto region(all burst into laughter) she said no family trip(all laugh) then told him later just before leaving the schedule,Drew said,i see will torment you then(all laugh) then our sis scoffed off saying you are so and so(all laugh) then Drew only said that yeah,even if sister is married for 50 years will ask me are you sure 50 years is not only after 49 hence(all burst into laughter) so will call me back from next term to ask what i’m doing then(all burst into laughter) and Mrs Maple ever says really both wife and sister fished the poor guy(all laugh) and brother was himself fished(all laugh) brother says yeah i was 5 time champ in 7 regions and was a geek of battling since 0(all laugh) then i get in and man it was nursing home(all burst into laughter) have you taken breakfast,have you slept well,have you walked after supper(all laugh) brush your teeth more gently(all burst into laughter) and yeah stomach problems headache too much emotion,too much or less generosity(all laugh),sadness everything was monitored even then(all laugh) then nursing home later was just mom and son stuff(all laugh) so Dave says in Kanto it felt like i was just about to get out of home alone on a cycle with two wheels not three(all laugh) same with May then not that much cause himself was 22(all laugh) and same with everyone even now as you see(all laugh) what is the reason for this naivety Ash(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “KOMMO-O(all burst into laughter)...no really i wanted to know which pokemon is most difficult to tame from Professor Oak when i was like 8(all laugh) since then know this name KOMMO-O(all laugh) and then was trying to understand what appeases a Kommo-O(all laugh) thought i should know everything about appeasing other people cause pokemons are same of course(all laugh) then realized well,what makes a person lose the psychophysical polish(all laugh) realized it’s parenthood so went on as much i understood and could do and then yeah now i do it cause my brats whole time tells me to counter myself(all laugh) so just a way to counter naivety(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “i only hope the future doesn’t become spoiled brats due to too much tendering(all laugh) anyway,but you get your pokemon in a way but nobody tells a brat like Feraligator to master him in the opposite way(all laugh) she came during the Hoenn break and jumped her big bro and then me saying no way she is leaving us without another journey(all laugh) and infact she is so simple and sweet really like her bro did need her family to be with her or very very good friends like Cili(all laugh) and in Kalos and then Elite4 this brat obviously had the dark company(all laugh) but Cilan says man had you been there you would’ve had doubts if you’re a human or not(all laugh) today gym tomorrow Reshiram next day team rocket next day test in between the previous two days of competition done next day final of that(all laugh) and said too slow this process 4 days enough for 3 gyms and 2 competitions isn’t it(all laugh) and of course let wild brats that too dragons like Hydreigon and Palkia then Kommo-O fondle his nerves used illegal medicines to become sane again if Cilan protested don’t you like them Cili(all burst into laughter) Cilan said he professionally sabotaged me(all laugh) and says pokemons have never been the same to me again cause now i see a brat and think of my age related issues(all burst into laughter) and Iris he says went there so extremely overzealous then last 6 months this brat looked and behaved exactly like a Kommo-O(all laugh) so was too scared thus won the next league cause of the fear to face this kind of a brat made her understand that family life is so important(all laugh) and simultaneously was relieved to get away from there and understood if that brat’s absurd methods and innumerable abtruse discussions she knew could beat anyone in her own way(all laugh) and that feeling of freedom being released from 2.5 years of hell got her the tile(all laugh) and infact won by quite a margin too(all laugh) and Cilan says,i flew off next morning didn’t meet him cause he might’ve dragged me to Huntelion again(all laugh) cause he was extremely dissatified with the opposition being mere kids and he wasn’t getting the food he expected that is all should discuss abstruse philosophy both the humans and pokemons and reach an disagreement of agreement(all laugh) while the referee moderated it(all burst into laughter) and his bunch was not dissapointed but incensed with the whole world and especially him that they weren’t being fed girlfriend and each of the beaus together(all laugh) but MENTALLY(all laugh) which is they wanted to do what they do now after all life in fight and fight as fire(all laugh) and in that situation he would’ve got all dragons cause authority couldn’t say one word(all laugh) and he asked Cilan if he could do Frontier there as well(all laugh) hence Elite4 presented him with the honourary Frontier trophy and begged him to relieve their region and the sane dragons(all laugh) and what sort of chosen brats have come to our biggest misfortune to tell them that they cherish us but ethically(all burst into laughter) just that blooming difference between pre,mid and post youth Gary Oak,Mr Oak and Dr Oak(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) and this brat has taught them these things(all laugh) and Cilan said i didn’t meet him texted that bye see you later(all laugh) then 3 years he was going through that age(all laugh) and says man i needed to take a month full bed rest after that and Iris the same(all laugh) and then i told Cilan that the brat’s personal life has been obviously spoiled now(all laugh) said yeah,i told him so many time only ‘mam could still talk with him(all laugh) surely went to date with that Giratina(all laugh) later never spoke of personal matters till patched up then once asked about him i said absolutely no relations with me either for 3 years now since that break-up itself(all laugh) said i see(all laugh) and now says,during the 3 years said obviously whole Unova was pestering him to tell them everything about this brat as he wasn’t on the cover(all burst into laughter) then he settled down with Jane who pestered him the most on this(all laugh) and they confirmed at a water performance show of Sensational Cerulian Waterflower Sisters featuring none other than Misty ‘mam(all laugh) then he says,finally dealing with dragons and all wisdom dawned upon me that that pest was a combination of each dragon(all laugh) and other brreds too(all laugh) so went there and the pest was jovial by then(all laugh) Cilan says,he had a Gengar with him sitting on his head(all laugh), mind the adjective which asked me(all laugh),have you not been tickled properly during your moments thus serious(all burst into laughter) mental tickling in mental moments of mental seriousness though(all burst into laughter) but you must tickle before the moment cause practice only makes you perfectly prepared Mr Green(all burst into laughter) Mr Green do you know dustumsoponus-zyglobsus-progohomic-neuroglasom-klaftostob-synoruptum-celifictybe-nefersolhygen-conprustor-psychomosic half subtle,semi neural,2/17th gross state-of-art tickling(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter) i managed to flee the scene cause that first that dreadful dark meance was calling me Mr Green TWICE in proper sentences(all burst into laughter) then if that wasn’t appolocalypse enough(all laugh) that most loathed frivolant ghostly pest was trying to REVOLUTIONIZE tickling to being with(all burst into laughter) then wanted me as a disciple(all laugh) and that too was the state of art in that abstruse plane that is atleast Xormnuh+ for sure even by his ghostly lunatic standards to send me to 500 lives later still insane(all laugh) and most dangerously this dark brat isn’t pleased with the state-of-art known to us or even Ghostradarkarrigussonor at all so has already revolutionized it and now was trying to give the concrete proof(all burst into laughter) so there’s no hope for me in next 500 lives for sure(all laugh) and thus i realized these have now surpassed 2000 year mark of utmost lunacy(all laugh) and yeah the revolutionary also was called in ONLY FOR ME(all laugh) to tell him you’re an idiot cause you don’t revolt against the idea of happiness(all burst into laughter) cause it’s a self created trap(all burst into laughter) and Krookodile asked me if the being isn’t Cilan then what is Cilan(all burst into laughter) so i understood these pests certainly have woken up again hearing that maddening tune(all laugh) after 2000 years of sulmber to again redefine state-of-art lunacy at the cost of whole humanity to begin with(all laugh) and i was on the eye of the revolution to begin with despite 3  years absence so i got terrified they won’t forget me at all and now they will try to recruit my future to this revolution(all laugh) and so to save myself and my family and for the fact that i didn’t want to wait for 2000 years to meet him again thus patched up cause then he will finally have a Kommo-O(all laugh) who will ask me,Mr Green the mental abstract plane fights during the moments in preparation of the art are you apt in that(all burst into laughter)...and if i go to that plane it will be another 4000 years wait to be sane again(all laugh)..and Cilan says,man what a patching up method(all laugh),’um..hellow Mr Ketchum,it’s Cilan Green speaking’,’Jangomo-Hakomo-KOMMO-O(all burst into laughter)..’ i was already in next life thinking finally all the three brats have entered his den(all laugh) then i said,’Ash,please listen’,’i cherished you Cili,really Kommo-O though still cherishes you so so much Cili(all burst into laughter)’ then i realized this brat is trying to grab me to Huntelion again to marry me with his chosen Kommo-O(all burst into laughter) so i say,’Ash are you angry(all laugh)’,’anger,hatred,dissent,resentment,compassion,geniality,generosity,kindness,benevolence but HUNTELION ISN’T LEFT IN THE PAST TENSE(all burst into laughter) who are newly chosen as famed(all laugh)’,’Ash,look you know..’,’where to get Kommo-O right(all laugh)..’,then i realized this truely is a Gengar(all laugh) so just went on with it(all laugh) later asked him did you feel bad with my behaviour then(all laugh) said,’this earth,this sun/this grass(all laugh),whoose that dragon(all laugh)/this day,Cili please say/that a gym is here,thus let’s not stay(all laugh)/journey done,but never that feel(all laugh)/please Cili,eternally re-reel(all laugh)/this hunger if only born(all laugh)/illusive told Kalos(all laugh) unless opposite is torn(all burst into laughter),so Cilan says,i heard this and to save myself for ghostly translations hugged it out(all laugh) then this brat said what makes sweat unsweating Cili(all burst into laughter) then i was dumbstruck(all laugh) then this brat told whatever he understood about anatomy and how that has got him WOKEN(all laugh) Cilan says i realized the brats became jovial so battle was meaningless and master brat went out of profession then(all laugh) then Jane was introduced extremely formal and professional but as you know even there too absurdly caring questions(all laugh) asked Jane yeah tough profession but you know i have many dragons as well you may try this this helps me to get the relaxation but you know i don’t get much anyway cause my bunch wants me all time(all laugh) but yeah hard work your profession don’t overwork though some little kids that you foster are too playfull hence the schools chide them you shouldn’t be overworking for them they will realize the bond then themselves work if school isn’t good themselves will say freedom you see always helps all sides everywhere in general sense which i ever told Cili you’re too great give up this idea of gentlemanlike attitude you already are in core why bother the polish just be free to go to anywhere to get a like Kommo-O(all laugh) then he says man made my wife a real pet with these in no time(all laugh) praised me to heaven showing i’m 5 and she is 4(all laugh) then later Jane scoffed at me saying how could you leave him(all burst into laughter) i was laughing to myself  saying Jane if only you saw that brat Tyranitar at Unova with another choised brat Palkia(all laugh) and then finally Cilan said i realized he surely isn’t in a human relationship with state of arts(all brust into laughter) so just to confirm ask in a formal manner said,um..Ash all great(all laugh) but Misty ‘mam(all laugh)..’,’is a woman(all burst into laughter) do you want to know the ethical honesty of morality in conversational ethics ingrained in ethics of morality not alone(all burst into laughter),i then understood this line is from someone as well(all laugh) so asked whoose the teacher(all laugh) Guzzlord who is a male why(all burst into laughter) then i asked what does females say(all burst into laughter),’what is poison(all burst into laughter) cause any specific idea is that else where’s the need to specify thus poison as an idea isn’t this very idea the poison Mr Green(all burst into laughter)’ i understood these pests have got him totally screwed up(all laugh) so i fled the scene then(all laugh),anyway,then these abstruse things are never told to his wife at all(all laugh) he will know everything about his wife and babysit her to absolute(all laugh) from his actions and words his wife will learn about him if he is her soulmate or not(all laugh) cause emotions only words can convey wife needs hands on stuff of metaphysical honest hallucinations(all laugh) and Ash had Misty not said one word or asked you anything i guess Unova would’nt have happened(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “absolutely(all laugh) i wanted to call her each day for 10/15 minutes total in two terms(all laugh) the night video call for 10 minutes just to see her as my energy drink for the next day(all laugh) and that was without talks(all laugh) and the middle 5 during her lunch hours just to assure her that she is self established enough by all means and then the little few talks that is my current location and heath condition(all laugh) i didn’t want to know anything about Mist then just wanted to know if she was alive,in best health and staying strong enough no matter her professional or personal life that’s it(all laugh) the first and 75% of third was assured by video call,second by the 5 minutes(all laugh) and 25% of the third 3rd by her mental disposition during mid day and tone(all laugh) physical disposition 10 minute silence enough none can keep looking at her hubby for 10 minutes without one word unless she is indeed his soulmate and the viseversa exactly as well(all laugh) and i was foolish enough to not detect that earlier cause we did exactly that for 60 minutes almost in Johto itself(all laugh) i just had her all within me then i was so assured that my wife won’t mind this at all cause she as well is totally deluged in me as much as i’m with her(all laugh) and knows me so well and the viseversa was my assurence and i just needed to see her once a day that’s all but Mist being Mist never jovial around me(all laugh)...so(all laugh) wasn’t then either thought why will he call me Misty obviously(all laugh) and my cunning nature she only knew to the core so it didn’t help her either(all laugh) and then brats jumped but then came the Eloquence(all laugh)..no really man you know all these cause she was in both her and my family i only needed a frank discussion once a week with Sarah of all people(all laugh) just to know what’s Mist’s condition in actual and Daisy’s reactions(all laugh) and all the solution lied in the simple fact that the jackal would’ve been set upon Mr Oak Mr Oak to lose it(all laugh) then he would’ve become personal thus totally lose it with Electrivite,Ampharos and then Tapu Koko(all laugh) but Tapu Koko has fled the scene the day Tyranitar arrived here(all laugh) and thus jackal would’ve forced Gary to propose Lillie becoming Oak Mr Oak(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) and Lillie would’ve in turn cajole the Daisyl to become Daisy and run after the jackal(all laugh) so then whole family was here thus hardly a trouble and i would’ve sweared Brock still if he didn’t get married VIA Boulder(all laugh) including that picture though(all laugh)...but Mist wasn’t happy with the trekking plan was she Brock ever(all laugh)...”
Brock(laugh) : “yeah never in a million years(all laugh) husband goes to Frontier and wife tells husband,um..couldn’t you make it 320 days trekking(all laugh)...then now that the husband has formally announced to the whole world(all laugh) says,’um..Mist,326 i’ll actually do you know the other 5 days are shown to fool these pests(all laugh) but all for you the number for me(All laugh)..’,this sweetens up the wife so much that she drowns her own phone(all laugh)...anyway,then from here started his special catching or invitation ground(all laugh) /only went to places where special pokemons were found(all laugh) /and we either complied or would be left for a round(all laugh) /then he will come back and feed us to the new hound(all laugh) then Sinnoh was extremely dangerous(laugh) says,143-143-52(all laugh)..yeah,max record for competitions at your requirements is 52(all laugh) and gyms record is 143 with your mandatory ones here(all laugh) thus you’ve touched that feeling(all laugh)..break it 153 with 10 more hall of fames and 2 more competitions to 153-153-54 right Brock that’s better far from what’s needed though 200-200-63(all laugh)...i said i give up(all laugh)..wife first time agreed(all laugh)..294 days trekking,mind that atleast people do 385 as it’s written in the gospel of trainers(all laugh),332 Brock(all laugh) only choised regions why waste time(all laugh) a gym in 1.75 days Brock you know Charizard don’t you(all laugh) either he or as usual Solgaleo,you know him(all laugh) and Talonflame and Pelipper too(all laugh) rivers Crawdaunt for you(all burst into laughter) but we most times will have Charizard so all of us there or if not then as usual Talonflame and Pelipper who will carry lady Dawn she is lady enough to be air ported(all laugh) and then you will be on Solgaleo and Crawdaunt don’t you like them Brock or the viseversa(all burst into laughter) the viseversa compels me to viseversa them i said(all laugh) hence they are pokemons Brock(all burst into laughter) just like humans(all burst into laughter) and last region was Kanto Frontier there did 331 days of trekking here 332 one day is a gym Brock ain’t it(all laugh) Dawn is too much a lady to understand anything but expression(all laugh) so this helps her as well and she namecalled me for not visiting more cities(all laugh)..sadly can’t increase competitions cause of damn rules of 3 days mandatory(all laugh)..2 days enough for 7 battles 8-23 ain’t it Brock(all laugh)..Charizard was finally too ready by the start of Sinnoh(all laugh) for us to use instruments to get at pace covering multiple hunders in as many hours(all laugh)..well Liza says that brat needed a choised girlfriend only responsible(all laugh) once that was spotted himself surpassed all else by lightyears(all laugh) and now Liza says had Gabriel been out of profession not one day could’ve stayed here(all laugh) this one to get another who is moling for the other,deepening(all uncontrollbaly laugh)..anyway,then in Frontier same experience but the pace was not instrumented cause Max was too little and it was Talonflame(all laugh) and Solgaleo(all laugh) Drew had a excrucietingly hard time there(all laugh) and the Palkian lie detector was there(all laugh)...but still Unova you know(all laugh)...Cilan told me after one or two month i saw him doing impossibly much(all laugh) asked for his plans,yeah,300-300-72(all laugh),why are you not happy to see new places and mythical dragons dear Cili(all laugh)...Cilan didn’t say one word then cause more than 300 gyms hasn’t been heard in 1000 years and this beats that record with 80 more gyms(all laugh)..and the 300 was dones by the once only Daniel de Hurstman once ever legend and his times and all totally different and hall of fame like now didn’t exist then and he was from Unova as well and that was done in Sinnoh(all laugh) and then that had 280 special gyms also then Battle Frontier concept wasn’t there of course cause cities were so rare(all laugh),this pest has got 100 better to 300 hall of fame(all laugh)..then Iris said isn’t it too much Ash,’i see but we need to improve each day a gym 369 should’ve been the right number shouldn’t it all my scheduled days 1 gym each’(all laugh)..this in 3rd month Iris later told Cilan is he insane(all laugh),Cilan said i just told her if he continues for next 3 months like this,we’ll be once in 2000 cause none is going anywhere near him before next to next millenium(all laugh)..and this one wasn’t told before only came by Cilan we came to know much later cause he told them not to disturb us(all laugh) we were told 235-235-63(all laugh) and for this one only the wife said too much(all laugh) who was sweetened saying i still remember Misty told me so strickenly(all laugh),’Mist,please,don’t take any unnecessary tensions dear,i will have to change my plans if my companions don’t agree midway(all laugh) or something serious happens back at my places but gym is everyday so if you don’t take enough rest in the morning you’ll too be tired,are you eating dry-fruits every morning dear? but don’t eat to much and drink water afterwards otherwise you may have constipation(all burst into laughter)’..again the wife was too sweetened(all laugh) but took dry-fruits and had to be cautious of loose motions or constipations(all laugh)...later of course we knew through press about the impossible records(all laugh)...300-300-72(all laugh) then next 230-230-72(all laugh) and you know wild pokemons fondled his nerves(all laugh) and Unova 147 more hall of fames than before with 147 in total as well(all laugh) previous increasing rate was gyms with hall of fames 83 and competitions 18(all laugh) competitions will increase by the same rate 18 due to damn rules(all laugh) in Sinnoh this pest did 153,in Unova did 5 more months but almost did same number of gyms EXTRA(all laugh) so basically it was 147 gyms and 18 competitions in 5 months that’s 294+54= 348 days work in 150 days(all laugh) at hall of fame and competitions top notch places in Unova of all places(all laugh)...i asked him on the plan we were given that Ash,please you’re not serious you have to trek atleast an 370 days now that it’s Unova the hardest place with all those dragons you’re forgetting the basis why we all started we need to go to the wild to know pokemons first even if by questioning and becoming them you may not need time but they may require time to be you(all laugh) and more so cause they are dragons(all burst into laughter) you need to give them time if not yourself(all laugh) and only then all else follow..um,Brock,didn’t you see Charizard(all laugh)...Charizard was whole time at Unova along with Charla for one third(all laugh)..rest 2/3 video call(all laugh)..never used except as vehicle(all laugh)..and Sinnoh he was there 5 times in total 25 months in average spans of 3 months,rest Solgaleo,Pelipper and Talonflame managed(all laugh) and that brat Crawdaunt as well(all laugh) most of the times were in Sinnoh and each time back after with Feraligator was more of a brat(all laugh) same thing Feraligator did when he had to be in Frontier and Crawdaunt at lab(all laugh) soulmates by all means(all laugh) but Charizard in Unova was there whole time(all laugh),Charla went to Sinnoh not when Madgaleo was there(all laugh) and last 4/5 months or so we were on none other that the great pursuer of happiness(all laugh) that brat came to this one all by himself cause he wanted to discuss the journey of concentrated hapiness of subtle gliding in bliss(all burst into laughter) this is what this brat told that brat to understand during first experience inside the ball(all burst into laughter) and then in Unova after saying that Charizard is ready said Cili is as good as you i’ll target only 3 places least dense,average dense and most dense population to negotiate the family(all burst into laughter) and this in average takes 5.5 days so say 16.5 and i get 20 that is 330 days and i do 327 cause 3 days are saved as my brats are getting better only so 3 days will be saved won’t it Brock(all laugh) i said yeah return not as a dragon(all laugh) but a HUMAN(all laugh) and infact it was negotiation which was by going there and letting wild brats fondle his nerves(all laugh)..and then those fights(all laugh)..Tyranitar(all laugh)..your Tyranitar is really in hall of fame for scaring the universe and now pestering them to death(all laugh)..and still he has two other similar gems Solgaleo and Yveltal(all laugh)..now in pursuit of happiness making them way more unimaginably dangerous..then Tyranitar is special having ended Gary’s career(all laugh) and pestering me to the most when a Larvitar(all laugh)..Kalos was most dangerous though,230-230-72 with university lectures and worldwide undercover court cases(all laugh) and 282 days trek in most untravelled region with first time ever he had to do everything and Clemont only helped(all laugh)...this the wife later knew and she was telling us how anatomies help her husband the most(all laugh)...then during Elite4 you know(all laugh)..first ever general challenger 5 weeks,6 regions,3 days 45 each all different gyms(all laugh)..so in Unova he saw off 345 hall of fames in total and in Kalos total 275 all hall of fames(all laugh)..so in most untravelled and hardest regions he has covered 620 gyms with 620 hall of fames best(all laugh) and conquered the leagues in those ways and all(all laugh)...no wonder Kalos and Unova gave him the honourary Battle Frontiers too all should’ve been given 620 times(all laugh) and in Sinnoh still 153 hall of fames and Hoenn 96 hall of fames(all laugh) Kanto Frontier 70 hall of fames Johto 74 out of 76,2 spared one was Anabel sweetie(all laugh)...”
Misty(frown,irritated,hugging Ash very firmly,Ash bursts into laughter and hugs Misty very firmly) : “SHUT UP!(all burst into laughter)..don’t look at my Ash(all burst into laughter)...my(all laugh) Ash is my sweet hubby bee(all laugh and burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “Mist!Mist!you’re so sweetie(all laugh)...right(all laugh),well what of the statistics Brock(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “too sweetened(all laugh),well about Unova and Kalos,we went there and after the legend taming as Misty is in Orange and Kanto a household name now,Ash in Sinnoh were before but Kalos says,is he an alien(all laugh)..and Unova(all laugh) they don’t say anything(all laugh)..and still holds the mind the word INHUMAN record(all laugh,Tracey laughs most) of winning all competitions across 4 regions in whichever he competed in obviously including Sinnoh,Unova and Kalos(all laugh) and Hoenn(all laugh) and in Unova and Kalos he won 144 cometitions(all laugh) and still won 54 in Sinnoh and 45 in Hoenn(all laugh) but a lesser known record(all laugh) that was 99 and still 36 in Kanto Frontier of all villege-cities(all laugh) so total has 279 consecutive competitions win across 12 years with one year break but at undercover competitions(all laugh) and yet the other for the other 78 won 73 losing only 2 in his very first region at Kanto being psychic to Melody and ground to Gary(all laugh) and the rest 3 being water out of which all 3 were to his own wife(all laugh) yeah already wife as all time wife(all laugh) and since Johto itself each were topmost competitions and in Kalos and Unova later they said why bother we will give you every badge and trophy and league give mortlas a chance at life(all laugh)..so total has 1250 gym badges with Cerulian old that is(all laugh) and 352 competition cups from 357 with the record of 279 consecutive(all laugh)..anyway,Ash continue out of constipations(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “ well the chance i said why are you after my livelihood(all laugh) that was it..and well Persy and Samantha are preaching Mist’s name in Kalos now else they will have big troubles(all laugh)...in Johto it’s ridiculus(all laugh) and Hoenn too most knows her too well,Sinnoh a large section does,Unova doesn’t recognize anyone unless you have 300 legendary dragons in your kitchen(all laugh)..which is being solved with Garchomp(all laugh)...Garchomp won’t fight cause that was done in the Tyranitar phase too much(all laugh) with the great Tyranitar himself(all laugh) but enough for a prize(all laugh) and if he’s not sufficient i’ll send the Lord with his 4 comrades there IN ALL DUE HONESTY,THOUGHT,BEAUTY(all laugh) AND BEING Circularly LOGICAL(all laugh)...well,in Elite4 the respective trainers hall of fame of all ages were DEALT WITH(all laugh) in the weekends at HQ,in Elite4 the hall of fames as you know the trainers and few from general category Friday and Saturday they battle,Monday to Wednesday gyms and Thursday you may visit old gyms and so on and Sunday break and well that excluded me the whole world was at HQ itself to receive me(all laugh) so 3 gyms/day then at night extra visits on Sunday(all laugh) then 3 days at HQ and Sunday again other places visit(all laugh) and hall of fames was 1 match each for 1 hour each 10 rounds with 45 minutes break to change pokemons(all laugh) started at 8(all laugh) 8-9,9:45-10:45,snacks+break(all laugh),11:30-12:30,13:15-14:15,lunch WHILE discussing(all laugh) and you know still as i ever do after food walk a mile(all laugh) while questioning(all laugh) well at Elite4 it was discussions as you know with my brats(all laugh) problems and solution they know everything(all laugh),15:45-16:45,17:30-18:30 now HQ can go beyond 19 so,then break for snacks,then finally 19:15-20:15,by 20:30 i finished(all laugh) then everything else till 22:30 study till 23:45 or 23:50 couldn’t move an inch then of course(all laugh) just prepare and slept and commuincated jumping as you know next 5.75 hours so from 00:30-6:15 everything done(all laugh) rest from 6:15-7:45 get ready choose the chosen brats(all laugh) then at dot 8:00 match starts(all laugh) lived in changeroom(all laugh) so i had 21 total in 3 days for 7 weeks(all laugh),you know total 62 day 2 days to come and see off the region after 60 days if alive(all laugh) out of which 7 days preliminary and 7 before final and total 10 days ten so you have 17 days to make it 43 and then another 3 days to entertain beauty or Cili(all laugh) so you get 40 days and all out of which 21 days you will battle(all laugh) so then i sweared all such schedules off(all laugh) i did 5 weeks of this and 6 total weeks Cili’s were given only one day(all laugh) and the i had no time for settlement issues so i did 49 days off which 42 i brought the circus to the mass(all laugh) and you know the gratitude we all have to the commentary team’s drama(all laugh) and the Elite4 heads were given translators as to provide the POLISHED version of what the brats were saying(all laugh) rest all themselves understood what they understood of the ACTUAL words(all laugh) surely if Noivern’s actual words you know no fun at all with just delaying methods(all laugh) then i did 5 weeks and then the rest general hall of fame and a hell lot of gym leaders came at HQ as well(all laugh) and retired people too faced Katy as you know(all laugh) and she was 74 then(all laugh) still persisted i said 5 minute time limit special from 21-21:05(all laugh) then you will teach me for 1 hour then will sleep only(all laugh) she chose her Chu,i said mine is most serious said then get Noivern(all laugh) fetched Nivy at 22:00(all laugh) when here it was 02:30 here(all laugh) yeah my case is special you know as the brats call me master brat(all laugh) then Nivy did what he does and Pikachu told Katy too much mental pressure(all laugh) was asked at your age the experiences that pokes at your thoughts the battles the ideas the feelings(all laugh) in the thoughts as your ideas as in thoughts they appeared(all laugh) what are your ideas of life as interpreted in your ideas of battling youself to remain thoughtful of yourself through the being opposite of your own opposing beings(all burst into laughter)..immediately match was over Katy at first got the actual words then the tralsator and then i also told and referee gave the translated version and had a look at Nivy and all Nivy returned at 23:30 here(all laugh) said such balanced life no thoughts of that idea of the fulcrum on which the balance,mere kids(all burst into laughter) send the brat off immediately here returned and jumped Mr Oak Mr Oak at 04:00 AM(all laugh) then Katy was very happy spoke with me a bit etc was a great experience really,anyway these general ones all were 4 on 4 matches and thus given 6 minutes and so on for the next 3 days of the week at the HQ and i battled 2 days there as well now that total 7 was made 14(all laugh) so for 2 weeks 2 days total 28*2 = 56 battles and overall gross and rest 2 days i went to places where i wanted to go or was invited and so on(all laugh) so in gross i did 56+45+147 thus 248 battles total(all laugh) and hall of fame 147 were completed in total(all laugh)..and each year in average theres 21 hall of famers in total,each for 1 region 4 in everage so in next 31 years there were 124 max say 160 or change regions say 170 including Elite4 head and vice,and you have to do 7 weeks and 40 mind that(all laugh) i did 147(all laugh)..and the rest 23 on 7 Sundays of course(all laugh) each day once for vacation thus 7 and rest 14 i did BEFORE the very final(all laugh) and the junior head was the very day of the final(all laugh) from 8:30-9:30 and then the head from 12:30-13:30 bye(all laugh)..so total 170+56+45 = 271 barring the invitation fights that was thrice a week for total 15 as well hence total 286(all laugh) and at Sinnoh still went on head hunting as did in Kanto as you know to extract certain infoes(all laugh) all at night of course(all laugh) and at night like Blanie and all didn’t fight just fooled around cause they let their bunch to play like Lance did(all laugh) well all did infact it was just too hard to play them(all laugh) but then referees were entertained beyond imagination excluding Vickie boy and Hana sis and Sally and Foyth did see one each but stayed mumb(all laugh) and Vickie boy and Hana sis says yeah THIS IS WHY WE DIDN’T GO CAUSE YOU COME AND THE GYM BECOMES A CIRCUS YOU HAVE SPOILED THE GYARADOS(all laugh) i say cause i like her(all laugh)..right(all laugh),sweet Mist Gyarados(all laugh)..right(all laugh)...so(all laugh),then all talks were about legendary pokemons and Gym security systems(all laugh)..thus i visited a few,others were visited by phone(All laugh)...out of those 15 that i visited on Sunday(all laugh) and the extra match was from 7:15-8:15 as usual(all laugh) then went out on dragon travel for 3*3 as 9 and then 6:00 more then another 15 minutes thus returned at 23:15(all laugh) checked in dinner was done before too much subtle body already enough rest at night communicate and all then study again and so on(all laugh) Cili i told look at this schedule KOMMO-O(all laugh) Cili said man quit it you know you and those pests of yours have defamed the whole profession(all laugh) and spare innocent dragons(all burst into laughter) you’ve made my region ashamed of dragons(all burst into laughter) and Kalos too(all laugh) atleast at Sinnoh you were sane(all laugh) i said,Cili i could’ve been beaten in Unova you know(all laugh) Cili said,yeah like team rocket tried too(all laugh) i remember during finals that Hoopa knocked my door at 2 in the night saying good night means night is good it’s not a wish(all burst into laughter) you must realize that Mr Green means a Mr that ever green not seriously though shouldn’t you(all burst into laughter) i decided to flee the scene right after cause i was called Mr Green by a psudeo-legendary ghost named Hoopa(all laugh) and he was teaching me that my surname isn't me hence he will take me to the meaning of it making me immortal my sending me to next life(all burst into laughter) AND YOU LET THAT BRAT ROAM FREELY AT NIGHT THE WHOLE BUILDING WITH AEGISLASH(all laugh) who told Iris battling then handshake too contrasting hence only you're so tensed(all burst into laughter) she almost cried to me in phone saying where are we(all laugh) i said not in million years(all laugh) and Cili i talked with after 23:00 or 23:15 or 23:30(all laugh) for innumerable hours(all laugh) the brat was compelled to wake up late so that his work gets spoiled(all laugh)..Cili(all laugh)..really Cili is Cili..and beautiful men was given 3 days first day to insinuate out second to challenge 3rd to uninsinuate out(all laugh) then returend and again battled 2 or 3 matches with more hall of fame gyms and so on(all laugh) and final day was at home next day sneak them through airport illegally and back to parlours(all laugh) on Salamences(all laugh) Salamencian life is about if i see you you’ll be killed(all laugh) thus can’t see a Salamence so say i’m so dejected and then Salamence will try to kill everyone concerned(all laugh) and finally will understand must kill itself which they will do along with you only though(all laugh) and hence tamed(all laugh) so this was schedule and out of such 15 gyms Anabel was there cause of professionality(all laugh)...that was 2nd gym at Johto just after got Feraligator(all laugh) who was second i still remember after Heracross who was first there then(all laugh) and Sceptile then Crawdaunt(all laugh) so Johto got Heracross very quick then Feraligator quicker(all laugh) and she is an excellent trainer as you know all(all laugh) and when met us was 22 only(all laugh) was in for 2.5 years or 2 and just like Mist in 2 years itself big name and got her Hall of fame at 34 and when i went was 4 years at hall of fame huge name(all laugh) well Mist got into hall of fame quickest possible time still i hindered her else would've been earlier(all laugh) but it's just me(all laugh,Ash and Misty smile at each other) Mist started at 22,January and then started at first nomination at 28,April when Glalie was used a bit in May i returned and Glalie got mad next month(all laugh) then she started at 2nd nomination at 31,January the picture of which got me back to reality and hence her(all laugh,Ash and Misty smile at each other) actually Mist told me later,i called few days before and had a rather good talk cause in 1 miute talk i said like,you're still beautiful enough for me to not judge that for this life atleast(all laugh) so was a bit happier(all laugh) really it was for one year almost all about beauty(all laugh) i spoke about it more cause of Palkian life(all laugh) and she did cause of Glalie(all laugh) then after that next day she tried to video call i said please i'm not saint you know as well just cut it(all laugh) these insinuations were just too much for Glalie too(all laugh) so this actually she said was too hard and then was off to this Mr Oak Mr Oak was approached on-the-fly(all brust into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing),who said yeah of that type of saloon(all laugh) anyway,Mist then finally had the hall of fame start at 35,March till April was ok then those brats still had to disrespect her personally dragging me in cause was hunting around my announced beau since the announcement and now travel companions were searched hence she was being hunted and some brats fed them with Sinnoh trophy and McShin cup infoes too i couldn't be approached on the issue cause i was in Johto too battle starved(all laugh) one brat asked me,Ms Misty,which gym,what type,where's the invitation card,lineup is Butterfree,Palkia,Guzzlord going day after tomorrow 6 Am(all laugh) so was off(all laugh) then a few directly still asked about Ms Misty Waterflower and i said no i've got nothing to do with them and rather with the little i heard she is a star for years it's new to me that i have to do the honours now for her to get falsely linked to another again(all laugh) just spare me and i wish she gets some peace too that atleast i only have respects for gym leaders who as you said is just about in hall of fame(all laugh) all said yeah your travel companion i said so it's a sin for me and her isn't it like you as well never heard any office say this gender not allowed(all laugh) they realized it was off immediately cause this would've slipped to the grand path of blood and sweat if they didn't(all laugh) but Mist is too sweet as usual no matter what as her very nature is such so sweet,so then she was pestered and this got a few brats jumping up and down as well in hall of fame here as well who by the time i was in Kanto was after me again hence mom was harassed by press and those chosen brats were called after the incident cause any name ever got ghosted back to the enquirer(all laugh) then told them do you want me to start insinuating about your lives too(all laugh) i can know each chosen brat from each hall of fame everywhere remember my career after Unova and Team Rockt's career after that(all laugh) realized none wants a chosen Meowth to redebut in info extractions with Lance's permission this time(all laugh) so those brats since then were off but my dear wife still had to bear the blows cause i never cared to extract her infoes(all laugh) except the ring finger size that is(all laugh) then in May brats were after her and then she after that press of differentiation anyway wasn't right then started those then still was ok in May then from 3rd week of week of June and then July and August was not hence Lance by end of September said 3 months no good then i was desperate to marry my soulmate and he only told in February/March she wasn't married(all laugh) so i got that only 6/7 months ago she wasn't married(all laugh) so jumped in(all laugh) anyway,so Mist did get it in 13 years the quickest and for Anabel actually she started at end 19 almost 20 and then took one more year so at 34 she was in hall of fame and her signature pokemons are two actually she got a Kyogre all do(all laugh) and then has a Tapu Fini(all laugh) both psudeo-legend and Tapu Fini was from gym,Kyogre was caught at Kanto first region for her and she used both actually with me(all laugh) and then still has many more like Abomasnow and Gyarados(all laugh) infact she was contacted for Tlplocus taming as you know said why not Mark he will use Kommo-O after all(all laugh) who said Tlplocus isn't that that type of Relicanth(all laugh) and Anabel still tells Mist you should’ve said i will tame only if i get one(all laugh) Anabel and Mist are direct competitiors(all laugh) and Mist’s stardom was extra plus so got the name and then Johto is sleepy as ever(all laugh) her hubby is Mr Clinton Guzzman not Lord though(all laugh) thankfully(all laugh) he is a electric type specialist as Tony boy is and was saying yeah after all why not Tlplocus to guard gyms too now that all knows they are scared of electric themselves as your Spiritomb says just that bit of joviality(all laugh) Spiritomb i showed them when was there after returning from Unova(all laugh) Anabel said atleast one ghost i want be be scared(all laugh) got the brat who hallucinated all of them was in tears laughing as i commentated(all laugh) Mist was told drag your hubby at shows which she did ultimately(all laugh) anyway she is another water gym leader with whom i have 18 year connection now(all laugh),except Mist there are now may be other 70 in total(all laugh)..cause of different VIEWS(all laugh)..but the view of my Mist battling is so sweet(all laugh)...Mist knew all my contacts now about 900(all laugh) EXCEPT ONLY A CERTAIN MELODIOUS ONE(all laugh)...poor girl was for 7/8 years centre of the Empress’s wrath and was in Safforn(All laugh)..only till i said two words to the Gyaradosy empress(all laugh)..after two words Misty Waterflower became Mist Ketchum so was alright that ONLY she BOOKS me(all laugh)..right(all laugh),but Kanto being first i only did 12 gyms except the Frontier hall of fame 70 gyms of course(all laugh) and those 12 though those included Safforn and Cinnabar then itself in hall of fame as was Vermillion and Levender...and i have so much respect for the 12 i did travel and 4 now are in hall of fame excluding Cerulian so my 3 hall of fames there they cajole me i say absolutely not(all laugh)...normally visited and Sabrina i knew won’t ask(all laugh)....then my sweetie’s gym was contacted cause she was misbehaving as i wasn’t fondling her each minute but in 5 minutes once(all smile)...and you know in such cases the gym leader herself has to receive(all laugh),so my sweet doll receives,’sorry but i don’t like Mr Ketchum’s behaviour(all laugh) it’s not happening WE’RE DONE(all laugh)’,cuts off(all laugh)...just(all laugh) a sec(all laugh)..
[Ash(hugging Misty very firmly,Misty smiles at Ash,then rests her head head on his chest,Ash smiles and tenders her) : “sweetie,sweetie,can i hug you for whole day tomorrow,hum..?”
Misty(same pose,smile) : “with pleasure,but you’re having lunch here tomorrow,i want to eat you up as well,my sweet hubby”
Ash(smile,same pose) : “with Mistyvious pleasure(both smile at each other,then same pose again for a few moments)”]
right,but later trash talked her(all laugh) i knew my sweetie was in so much plight was to get her moods upwards(all laugh) so then i still remember that brat bunch(all laugh) Feraligator(all laugh),Lapras,Snorlax,Abomasnow(all laugh) cause why would we try to know her(all laugh) what a brat that has been since day one(all laugh) and then had Chu,and then the beauty(all laugh) well that brat was most happy to return so that the great Glalie methods were bestowed upon mere students(all laugh) and Feraligator was here(all laugh) then still had room for age related sentiment using Lapras(all laugh) and had Chu in the ball who went into ball after 13 years only in mid Unova as a challenge with Luxray(all laugh) then first Mist said Chu and he fooled around with Dewgong and Dewgong just went off frustrated with starving for the moment(all laugh) was told this idea of yours of leading how long have you been led by this idea to being with so ho are you a leader of self(all laugh) went off then i knew Feraligator,Lapras and Glalie Mist isn’t choosing at all especially Lapras and Glalie(all laugh) and only one all water rest ice or electric to tell her current condition and electric will break it(all laugh) and then Feraligator none chooses no matter who including me(all laugh) cause that’s just a damn brat(all laugh) you can’t stop laughing and thus she would’ve been proposed by me then and there(all laugh) if such cases arose then or later during handshake when i barely averted it(all laugh) it would've been just no words the hug and then to all would've said any trouble if i marry my 19 year long wife again(all laugh) cause after all only i book her(all laugh,Ash and Misty smile at each other in same pose) but hellrounds would've been there much shorter(all laugh) and i myself would've participated in it by questioning myself that Trace knows(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) anyway,and then i had Abomasnow,Chu or Snorlax and went for the three(all laugh) and then Snorlax at two and Snorlax was there and he was the one Mist wanted so much and it was Snorlax who did battle Gyarados then(all laugh) told her can you express yourself without rage(all burst into laughter) that was it cause for legend that was it(all laugh) cause when the legend said ‘you’re scared’,’ so are you(all laugh) thus you want to attack(all burst into laughter) i don’t attack to be angry with myself(all laugh) or other chosen brat like you who is here not cause of me but cause his beau didn’t like his too much whispers(all burst into laughter)’ many tricks mixed there legend understood this is an in born brat(all laugh) said are you lunatic(all laugh) normally(all burst into laughter) so you see i don’t attack to eat a fruit or something can can you fly i can’t but looking at you it might be so that you always attack to do anything(all laugh) then bored him to death with strange questions like if tree is climbed water is sawm then is air flown or the sky(all burst into laughter) and so on legend realized this is once only legendary inherent brat(all laugh) then finally to the legends utmost surprize says i’m going to sleep cause your disposition and behaviour bores me(all laugh) so legend finally psychied off the lunatic and played a bit and so on then the same and the legend was Gigantabisformat(all laugh) so then my sweet flower came and i realized that she became pale and the physical beauty isn’t there but just skinny and looked dejected used a huge long dress(all laugh) that i tore apart in her room and made sure she gets to see that after waking up cause the message was just a knock that wake up from the self created nightmare and there was no glaze in her disposition and looked like as if the outer body and inside had no connection what so ever and all and i was seeing her after 4 years and on the back of those realizations that she is my soulmate and was assured that all about her own condition will allow me to marry her nothing outside and her eyes had no glaze did see me eye to eye but was like to tired to see me again but wanted to see me and hug me so much but then as if self made shakles weren’t allowing her to then i realized the psychic disturbances and she was practising psychics in wrong way and all self destructing and then i saw she became 16 year old on the platform(all laugh) who faced me 19 years back and was namecalling me so sweetly(all laugh) and then she was trying to play the boogey girl(all laugh) at which she looked so sweet(all laugh) then i fooled around and that was chorused(all laugh) and the transmitter the illegal one(all laugh) then Goldy was at bay totally as Abomasnow questioned his basic nature asking why me(all laugh) and went off then Vickie boy of all was the ref(all laugh) gravely said after 2nd round next round continue or not(all laugh) Mist screeched before me(all laugh) so would continue and then that then they said Mist’s bunch gave in(all laugh) and i’m the winner the mob was mixed but had one brat tried to misbehave i had Gengar,Hoopa,Banette,Mismagius,Confragigus,Jellicent,Sableye,Marshadow,Dusknoir,Spiritomb,Aegislash,Bronzong,Rauniclas,Unown,Deoxys,Chanedlure,Rotom,Magearna,Beeheeyem,Meowstic,Uxie,Malamar,Darkrai,Gardevoir and Musharna (all laugh) this was only inside(all laugh) outside the gym if any brat intruded while i was getting out of there they had Giratina,Rayquaza,Metagross(all laugh),Yveltal(all laugh),Latios,Reshiram,Celebi,Ultranercozma,Noivern(all laugh),Hydreigon,Claydol(all laugh) yeah 35 pokemons invisible and the number too(all laugh)..right(all laugh), and that had 6 peudeo-legend dragons(all laughs) well all dragons are(all laugh) Decidueye,Garchomp and Zekrom being mostly ground can’t stay that long unless they are moving Reshiram being both types more than can(all laugh) as does Nivy(all laugh) none was intruding the match human or pokemon(all laugh) so no chance with any legends in any numbers(all laugh) and i had Banette beside me rest except Sableye was roaming around the whole gym(all laugh) and was knowing every bit it without anyone’s knowledge(all laugh) AND Mist had company behind as well(all laugh) with Sableye a 4 foot circle(all laugh) enough for her agitated mind to not understand anything(all laugh) and no my bunch if wants except me and very few legends not below top 4 or 5 in any category(all laugh) and humans none can know either(all laugh) and the humans are only Mr Oak Mr Oak(all laugh) even Dave can’t get them cause he passes less time there but later most certainly will,Zara can’t at all(all laugh) mom as well if not Mime she can’t but Mime she will way before me(all laugh) and outside only Sabrina but only Gengar cause she has handled Gengar from absolute birth(all laugh) well Gastly to Hanuter in day one comes to me and next day Gengar(all laugh) ever unhappy till i went had discussions with Sableye as host that brat instantly realized his comrade across times(all laugh) and the viseversa and jumped me my Haunter herself is a damn brat(all laugh) but still sane atleast like when Snorlax or Muk won finals(all laugh) but if Sabrina thus gets Gengar will get Sableye too(all laugh) and me(all laugh) and no these all excludes my flower now she can know each no matter what the brats did(all laugh) and the rest of you can’t cause you’re not trainers at that level otherwise you could but they are not standing silent around you(all laugh) Mr Skechit and Doctor Slate never(all laugh) neither Daisyl nor Lillie(all laugh) Violet is most honoured(all laugh) so everyone will jump her(all laugh) but then there is Mr Oak Mr Oak(all laugh) infact they treat him as pokemon as well(all laugh) hence Magmortgolem defected(all laugh) not one will stop from directly questioning him infact(all laugh) Trace and Brock might be spared still due to naivety(all laugh) that is(all laugh) they may play hide and seek with them that is but Mr Oak Mr Oak no chance(all laugh) no matter whether he picks up which he can or not those brats will not sit around if Mr Oak Mr Oak is around(all laugh) and Daisy will detect them after some years here even if she doesn’t want to(all laugh) cause she has been a gym leader since 19(all laugh) and still is(all laugh) she 4 days and Lillie 1 day mandatory both are leaders still(all laugh) and will be even if they don’t want to(all laugh) and Daisy used to handle Jellicent,Starmie,Manaphy,Kyogre,Kaledo,Phione,Dewgong,Ludicolo and Slowbro(all laugh) and still has a Blastoise with all those(all laugh) Daisy’s bunch though from gym and all and Daisy travelled Kanto and Orange we must understand(all laugh) with two different persons who were good enough trainers as well(all laugh) so her own bunch is Dewgong,Starmie,Blatoise,Phione of all(all laugh),and then she has a dragon Dragalge(all laugh) and still has a Pelipper,Slowbro and of all has Castform(all laugh) only of it’s kind water-ice-fire-normal(all laugh) and then still has 5 more(all laugh)
Golisopod(all laugh) Mist was afraid of this most(all laugh) then Kabutops(all laugh),Floatzel and Crawdaunt(all burst into laughter) and yeah Feraligator(all laugh) how are your Crawdauntogator,Floatzel and Castform Daisy(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “mere kids(all laugh)..no i’m so happy i fondled them too much(all laugh) if double duo was here srious issues we would’ve faced(all laugh)..Mist has Crawdaunt though and Samurott(all laugh)..well Crawdaunt all has infact too common brat(all laugh) as is Feraligator who is so least strenghthed(all laugh) but these two are HUMANS(all laugh)..and Castform was tormented most in mental battles by that brat Volcanion(all laugh)..but really Ash you were 1 time champ why Feraligator(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well answers are naively(all burst into laughter)..and Feraligator well both Mist and me tried to catch Totodile version both realized was too clever for being a pokemon(all laugh) then fake fighted(all laugh) and got Totodile and really Mist would’ve anyway had real trouble with that brat(all laugh) and he really you know would’ve turned on Mist for sure cause his nature is like that Goldy is innocent kid this brat is the most cunning prick(all laugh)..and no both me and Mist realized he is just outworldly stuff in intelligence even then(all laugh) cause i set Celebi upon him(all laugh) and tried to turn him against himself then(all laugh) Celebi said the brat has material(all laugh) then just came around and is what he is but no he would’nt have been what he is if i didn’t already have the likes of Snorlax and Abomasnow(all laugh) then never unless Crawdaunt came and that brat the same had Sableye with him at Hoenn(all laugh) Sableye too was jovial but a bit unmindful that is cause had a stench of mind till Gengar came (all laugh) and Gengar the same(all laugh) just unleashed the two as GENGLEYE(all laugh) and well Professor can detect a few if they are not at a very high level so can Doctor Slate and Trace and of course Daisy can but Trace and training well(all laugh) so he will ever be pestered by Marshadow though he will know each moment what is happeneing but with him(all burst into laughter) and Doctor Slate has great bunch but that feeling(all laugh) will make pokemons to fondle him to maxima and not hide around cause when you see this MAN(all laugh) just so naive(all laugh)..Lillie is ever treated as 5 year old and Violet is most honoured so never spared(all laugh) cause all will jump her as she is 4(all laugh) hence honoured(all laugh) Daisy is Daisyl so all will jump her making her sentimental(all laugh) but you will pick them up after few years more Daisy to your utmost misfortune even if you desperately try to prevent this calamity(all laugh) and Gary can cause he was extremely good at Kanto till he was woken as Mr Oak(all laugh) and has completed 2 regions and has had so many great pokemons and Tapu Koko and Victini and Oranguru and Umberon and Dusknoir(all laugh) so he surely can get these and his assistant is Giraora(all laugh) so he gets them no matter the level(all laugh) but yeah there are a few where only i can communicate as is the case for Magmortgolem where only Gary can communicate but ONLY IF JOVIAL which he’s not sadly cause that he needs to be while emotional(all laugh) Mr Oak Mr Oak are you not happy(all laugh)...”
Gary(laugh) : “yeah you two worded brat(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “just so naive(all laugh)...and well Dave surely will in like 100 more days though too interested(all laugh) and well Mist’s Crawdaunt and Samurott are too sweet(all laugh) and Carracosta is good at battles too much(all laugh) and she too is same as Samurott but water-rock-dark but too naive(all laugh) that brat Jellicent has become spoiled(all laugh) and her Manaphy and Kaledo as well too sweet(all laugh) and Tapu Fini too(all laugh) but Daisy there in gym except her own 13 still managed Kyogre and Manaphy of all and still Jellicent(all laugh) and Primarina(all laugh) so we also have Azumarill and FiniRina(all laugh)..Mist got 8,5,11 total 24 pokemons still had Togepi and later jackal bribed an Azurill(all laugh) which evolved though to Azumarill(all laugh) revolting against human wishes though(all laugh) then Gyarados of course(all laugh) and she has two starters(all laugh) so total 28 and Mist had Poliwrath first caught after she met me at Viridian and then had Corsola of course(all laugh) so her bunch is Poliwrath,CORSOLA(all laugh) Doctor Slate Doctor Slate how to train pokemons(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing),Crawdaunt(all laugh),Kingdra the first dragon(all laugh),Golduck(all laugh),Tentacruel(all laugh) some day that was(all laugh),Walerin and then lastly got Tapu Fini(all laugh) her first psudeo-legend actually Metagross came after him then in Orange had her best bunch really Lanturn,Primarina,Kaledo,Jellicent,Sharpedo..(all laugh) and beat the hell out of me in the last water cup there and then next two at Johto(all laugh) so sweet the frowns(all laugh,Ash and Misty smile at each other same pose) and in Orange that’s one psudeo legend and Jellicent and Lanturn and Primarina and still Sharpedo but he wasn’t of any use as Carvanha(all laugh) then Johto had Weavile,Carracosta,Manaphy,Jynx,Castform,Samurott(all laugh),Bruxish,Octillery(all laugh) what a brat that is(all laugh) still a brat but she likes Mist(all laugh),Clawitzer(all laugh) utter damn brat still but yet to be WOKEN(all laugh)..TYRAniTAR(all laugh) then Swampet(all laugh) hey you Doctor Slate battle or else(all laugh) Doctor Slate is ever the punching bag universally(all laugh) even Dawn of all people who is 15 years junior said i'm a way better trainer than you THIS IS THE RIGHT MEDICINE SHUT UP(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) just so naive(all laugh) and then finally Slowking(all laugh)..what a bunch she has really but the trouble is that she likes them but also likes me(all laugh) thus only Jellicent is spoiled cause he’s a ghost(all laugh) but still then i had a few pictures of Mr Oak Mr Oak via Mist who got via Lillie who got via(all laugh) and i kept those then took physical copies out well i’ve pictures of all my comrades here via Mist via her sisters via(all laugh) then i deleted everything except Mr Oak Mr Oak cause he was used as to my bunch was told to pester him and all to get an emotional attachment with him so that he doesn’t tell me to shift(all laugh) Mr Oak Mr Oak is ever played for 2 words emotionally(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) all in good times 2 words(all laugh) and Mr Oak Mr Oak's bunch thus has been poached(all laugh)..Magmortgolem(all laugh)..how are they Gary(all laugh).."
Gary(laugh) : "just move it you brat(all laugh)"
Ash(laugh) : "sweet sweet bro(all laugh),anyway,then Mist couldn’t know the ghosts being present and all cause i feared brats jumping and if they did atleast 100 would’ve been sent somewhere(all laugh) and there was 150 truely chosen brats(all laugh) a few did get the eloquence later(all laugh) and before the start on the platform i told that Ms Misty Waterflower i’ve been too busy today preparing for this match to look after myself properly..and i dressed so(all laugh)..and all and COUPLED WITH THIS(all laugh)..anyway(all burst into laughter),the fact that i will anyway win(all laugh) then with all the gathering it will be late is Pearl’s a good place(all laugh) whole crowd knew what i was talkig about then Mist was very angry but the message was what it was(all laugh) and then she scoffs at me and all after the match the handshake was hard(all laugh) cause i first time in my life had reminded myself that my wife is a girl(all laugh) so had to maintain a distance(all laugh) and by then the ghosts returned(all laugh) who were telling me to bodyslam Mist or tickle her(all laugh) and then i excused bad stomach(all laugh) to get the staffs more riled up(all laugh) and got pests in(all laugh) later and then during the handshake i realized Mist was very weak infact no matter what and i realized then the look means she’s using something to enhance the psychic powers all wrong and Goldy and all didn’t look good at all especially Golduck cause i was unfortunately too familiar with the brat(all laugh) who each day says the challenging brats are naive(all laugh) and Mist chids that brat 4 times can be used only once a week(all laugh) for exactly 10 minutes absolute max(all laugh) and Garchomp if come will tell him more tricks(all laugh) and get his tricks which is like Gengar,what is this duck if full of ache/consisting of responsibility and unfunny headache(all laugh) absolutely similar to Gengar but just fun Gengar is cunning(all laugh) so if that is told to Gengar the reply is like,’what is the ache if funny and nice/i can’t tickle you if i win the dice(all laugh) it’s a double edged sword(all laugh) means he doesn’t say that Golduck is inferior and yet gengsinuates(all laugh) that he must win(all laugh) at the same time saying that he’s THE lunatic tickle master(all laugh) and ten still has the time to create the rift saying you actually are here only to battle so this is a VEIL(all laugh) for Goldy it will work for Legends Gengar would be instantly killed(All laugh) cause legends must be given respect with due honesty in ethical approach(all laugh) and Goldy if is let to know the answer he’s not battling again(all laugh) the answer would be to become Sableye(all laugh) what is this duck if all alone/you are thinking that you can be lone(all laugh) means Gengar then will recognize that it’s only better to have more in team(all laugh) then he will budge but legends can say the same which Gengar knows and thus that line wouldn’t be used at all to begin with as i said(all laugh),what is this Gengar if full of care/you won’t tickle me and i can’t fare(all burst into laughter)...anyway,so i then shake hands and discretely ask cause i wanted that in front of the crowd as the final stamp of authority from her husband that you’ve breached many lines fine if furthur lights will get dimmed(all laugh) and i had 21 psychis around me(all laugh) later the outside was called when i released Dragonite and went to cape then got them in then went to Viridian and then subtle body dragon travel to indigo platue(all laugh) anyway, i discretely ask for which again i had to prepare before cause you understand the anatomy(all laugh) then actually i was shaky cause yeah i knew that Mist was the one and just me in a way still with possibilites thought may be not right but then did finally say that what’s the date today(all laugh) then before she could say anything i say just what it is cause from what i heard it’s right in public(all laugh) which to the buffoons meant the rest of the show is private(all laugh) and then finally Mist screamed(all laugh) which got the buffoons flattened(all lugh) and all i still joked around saying atleast the match was official(all laugh) and all i she was in tears in the end and i wanted to hug her to death so much(all laugh) i didn’t know one thing which the beautiful men no where could confirm neither anyone and yeah if she had a husband of beau would’ve got divorced i had the arrangements ready as you know(all laugh) cause i knew she can’t be happy with anyone except me after that picture and if she had people they were damn brats to allow her to that condition and also meant it was so cause she never reciprocated at all which would’ve got the brats’ family involved as well(all laugh) as my preparations were in or out of profession(all laugh) and then the only confusion was if she ever remotely had anyone in her mind cause i never did and that would’ve made me uncomfortable and then during break in it was almost confirmed that she is only waiting for me and then 2 words were needed again i’ve a beau get lost,why are you here without the police(all laugh) ‘Ash,why are you calling me Misty’(all laugh) so sweet my Mist flower(all smile,hugs Misty quickly smiling at her,Misty same pose smiles at Ash,then Ash back to same pose) no i really think Mist has so much name and skill and all then saw me and that’s it(all laugh) and i came out after the gym battle and all then broke-in(all laugh) surely i had to see my wife again(all laugh) later the they got me at the worst time before depating for Unova and i discretely said to the whole city have you liked it if a random sample walked up to your home and taking the opportunity of your absence due to your day-to-day work misbehaved with your spouse cause your spouse is naturally very nice and can’t be impolite enough to show to them their nature in a language that you can understand yourselves(all laugh) if you have then i don’t consider you as persons and that’s the end of my communication(all laugh) they got the thing(all laugh) and that was it then of course the ultimate protection was here(all laugh) so no talk(all laugh) they feared mad Zapdos(all laugh) but that was Lightenthunstrom max normal(all laugh) means Chu could electroculate the whole city and destroy it totally(all laugh) still both Telplocus and the brats are lucky that it was the most serious brat(all laugh) cause atleast he breaks sweat(all laugh) else prolongs(all laugh) but Zekrom can go four steps above Chu and Luxray and Zeraora(all laugh) man if any of the other 3 been there would’ve created a real mayhem cause they if need be can become even more overprotective than Chu(all laugh) and especially Zeraora cause he was all new never even saw Mist,Zekrom atleast saw her(all laugh) well all did cause what a sight she was at full madness(all laugh) Garchomp though says all a veil to reflect the self slyness of self reflective self rejection in reflection of self reflection of cherishing(all burst into laughter) who is told your idea of self cherishing the self is cause you don’t understand who you are in weakness you’re insecured(all laugh) those two brats are sworn-in enemies since day 0(all laugh) and Zeraora is himself a psudeo-legend entering hospitals and offices in full lunacy is something(all laugh) but had it not been Chu with Mist,first that confused Telplocus would’ve been told that AH BEAUTY BEAUTY(all laugh) means your plight is telling you that how beautiful the mental joy is(all laugh) that would’ve got the brat out of confusion and strainght flee the scene(all laugh) the the 16 brats would’ve been told you’re a team to catch your teammate who is free to roam around but you’re for no reason attacking us cause you think that we want to battle but AH BEAUTY BEAUTY(all laugh) cause this very foolishness is telling you that if you’re not then you too can enjoy the beautiful state of joy so you see you too are happy(all laugh) so then they would’ve said are you sane(all laugh) then would’ve cried that they are telling her she is ugly(all laugh) and so on then finally cause they were wild would’ve said AH BEAUTY BEAUTY who’s whoose beau who’s whoose beau who’s whoose beau(all burst into laughter) cause it’s beauty(all laugh) 1600 would’ve fled the scene immediately(all laugh)...cause AH THE BEAUTY(all laugh) what brats they are(all laugh) i’m told later that my 2nd master before was too serious so couldn’t appreciate the beauty(all laugh) why don’t you let me manage her now(all laugh) i said yeah substandard food you’ll get do you want that no only girlfriend(all laugh) is girlfriend beautiful(all burst into laughter) i just said enough mate just get the hell out of here and fled away(all laugh)..so then i come back and then they are again given tonics cause they want the certain star than the show(all laugh) and exactly what they won’t get cause it’s only my projected sweet star(all laugh)..right(all laugh),but the show they will get due to Violet’s endeavours(all laugh) and finally has recognized that the specific schools need to be monitored(all burst into laughter and .) and Elite4 even Kanto(all laugh) had to do that cause i told called a few at thier office and asked i want to have a chat pretty serious but are you FREE(all laugh) that word stressed was enough(all laugh) and still McShin is there(all laugh) McShin called me later implying that don’t think you’re something else who was packed off to Unova right(all laugh) cut the phone and went off(all laugh) the reason isn’t me he knew that day he wasn’t at his best cause he thought i’d be a pushover and Frontier is side show(all laugh) would’ve still lost 8-2 or 7-3(all laugh) but atleast Gyarados could’ve beaten Weavile(all laugh) and Shedninja had a chance againt Buzzwole as well anyway so all those that i had contacts with would never imply anything to me and i was sharing more and more Professional knowledge cause i was in that state where i just knew many thing...and also their own knowledge..it was excellent all till the Johto Elite4...then Orange was of course Orange(all laugh) and felt bad then in but then came to Kanto and you know the press there(all laugh) and well then too Mistyfied after last match(all laugh)...from there on my soulmate guided me to her(all smile)...anyway,about sweet cunning Melody(all laugh)..yeah,so Melody’s whole life was foisted upon me all times(all laugh)..just none ever understood except cunningly doctored professional people that barring my little sis and those two with Mr Oak Mr Oak and Harris,Kane,Susan,Braum and of course Tony boy with his other half Oliv psycho(all laugh)..i really wasn’t interested about personal matters unless it was Mist!Mist!you’re so sweetie(all laugh)..and i was only too much interested about personal matters of my Mist nothing else(all laugh)..and this idea what i just said though was scornfully scoffed of by the Spew(all burst into laughter) man that pest i tormented like none..INFATUATION,hum,INFATUATION,i’ll clear up her vomits BY MY OWN HANDS SENDING THE YOU PICTURES(all burst into laughter) man Drew was tormented to maximum and i battled him with Solgaleo(all laugh)..but about Mist i was interested about her whole day psychophysical activities(all laugh)..just like Gyarados(all burst into laughter)..that was Gyarados cause by her Mist told what she was doing like scowls and smiles(all laugh),so anyhow these brats thinks i’m a great friend and all and just sweetens it with personal talks and to Melody it was even more dangerous cause she thought i can guide her to her soulmate(all laughs uncontrollably) cause i was so professional except saying my health isn’t all right today(all laugh) to drive her off(all laugh)...all contacts were like that,’yeah met this girl or boy talked about this pokemons,but may i get a chance to enrich my knowledge with your help...’(all burst into laughter)..infact none knew that Mist is indeed my flower even if they knew her and to me ‘your girlfriend’,’farm management’(all burst into laughter) cause i have Tauros(all laughs)..Mist’s contact in my phone before marriage ever with full name and profession(all laugh) just like all except a Mr Jackal(all laugh)...mr cunnigman-gentle(all laugh) was Dr Muk Skechit(all laugh)..yeah even during the 4 years same and even now always(all laugh),Professor Gary Oak noe Mr Oak Mr Oak(all laugh),Brock is Brock First Famillial Feeling(all burst into laughter) that was ever there during 4 full name was written...then i had contacted Ms Daisy Cascade Second(all laugh) 10 times in 6 and half years(all laugh) now Mrs Daisy Skechit CascadeDaisyl(all laugh),Ms Lillie Waterwig(all laugh) 6 times(all laugh),now Mrs Lillie Oak Garywig(all laugh) and everyone of your names were in full names in 4 years EXCEPT as ever now the status-title only is Mrs but the rest as then was Ms Violet Expert Mantine(all laugh) 100 times(all burst into laughter)...please ‘mam(all laugh)...”
Violet(laugh) : “i was thrown into the bay really(all laugh)...gets Mantine(all laugh) in the beginning of Sinnoh before that called me may be 2 time in 1.5 years for total 4 minutes for birthday wishes including battles(all laugh) one 7 months later(all burst into laughter)..said um..the day is same(all burst into laughter)..next 3 days before(all burst into laughter)..but to me he was Mist’s greatest caring husband(all laugh) cause he still found time to pay his homage(all laugh)..then steals my poor boy(all laugh) and next month 15 calls(all laugh) then another 10 each next two months(all laugh)...beaked my head off really(all laugh)...and i would ask,’um..Ash,it’s ok that you want to know about Mantine as much but Mist(all laugh)..’,’um..no ‘mam it’s all right she is a bit emotional in professional matters(all laugh)...but ‘mam Hawlucha vs Mantine 4 th round 9th minute 2 challengers down..(all laugh)...’...that little prick compelled me to learn thunder-chair actually(all laugh)..then kept contacts till i namecalled the brat(all laugh)..still contacted me using sentimantal cards(all laugh)..which was that i still had an evolved pokemon which is very type strenghted so under the profession(all burst into laughter)..but Ash,i’m starting legal procedures too(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “well i’ll be saved then(all laugh)..swim or fly(all laugh)...what’s the great Mantine doing?”
Violet(laugh) : “obviously naive(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “right,so to continue one more is Unova(all laugh)...Jane is in full name but the name is Cili 301st (all laugh)..Cili(all laugh)..after the show Cili was saying yeah universal i said i see universal sweet sweet Cili(all laugh) the night sky depicts what in innumerabilty don’t you think they are unknown and waiting for us to be picked up Cili,waiting(all burst into laughter)..but the biggest two are obvious(all laugh)...Shrew that type of Drew(all burst into laughter) changed it to full name during 4 years but again back and finally only May little sister-pester(all laugh)..that was changed to May LITTLE sis then to her full name again the original is back..Max is little bro little pest Max(all laugh) rest well still have Iris’s contact she was written in full professional name and lady Dawn has been lady Dawn as usual(all laugh) and she is too happy now with everything and Oliver is so sweet a boy so naive(all laugh) but for Iris that was her pre marriage name infact and that’s cause it was really professional like if me and Foster were travel companions(all laugh) Foster is as Foster the Great Professional(all laugh) and Flores is Flores Azumarill not FiniRina(all burst into laughter) that was something really(all laugh) Tony boy electric(all laugh),Olivia Tony’s psycho(all burst into laughter),Brauchy man(all burst into laughter),sweet sweet Vickie lad(all laugh),Kane darling the date(all laugh),Irene is moling(all burst into laughter),flying fly Braumy manual(all laugh),Flavia new Brauchy man(all laugh),Harris son fell in grass(all burst into laughter),Brenda Viriz(all burst into laughter)..man Harris loaths me for this and the tone(all laugh),Hana sis after job(all laugh) then finally Sarah of all people(all laugh) now David Dave little bro and Zara little sis in law(all laugh) and finally my flower during travel first was full name till we went out of Viridian Forest(all laugh) then just Misty till Viridian(all laugh) then finally till reunion was Mist Ponytail(all laugh)..then obviouly Mistdos(all laugh)..yeah only that was written(all laugh)..then after first proposal full professional name(all laugh)..exacpet the status(all laugh)..and the surname(all laugh)..just was written Misty Fletch(all laugh) yeah that was to both drive anyone away and then to VEIL(all laugh)..and that name all got the city changed(all laugh)..then during the 4 years deleted too near to call(both smile at each other) then was Mist for 10 days then again all covered and now that is there..Mist has only one thing my Ash as ever since she came back before that the word best friend was in between(all laugh) but the preceeding my was enough(all laugh) and the rest are just nicknamed or others but my own number in my phone will ever be TYRAniTAR(all laugh)...cause that was the beginnig of the 7 years that really made me fulfilled and same for my bunch and same for Mist as well so that’s helpline stuff(all laugh),anyway lets go back to Melody and Melody this was just after her break-up too cause the brat was desperate to get a new beau as the previous one dumped her(all laugh)...this i came to know from the moods(all laugh)..and so on,Melody is as simple a girl as one comes across,and all because we were talking for 9 years by then may be 6 times a month for 9 minutes max cause she was the extra help later along with Sabrina,too good with psychic types as was Anabel with waters and i’ve met many in Unova far better than these but these two could surprize you suddenly with sudden tremendous intuition which Mist herself can’t do and those two were exactly like me in style Melody though no more in profession and i’m only happy for that cause it never helped her after that final victory but i spoke with her most cause first she came up with impossible intuitions and Sabrina was 8 times 15 minutes the most(all laugh) you may know about Mrs Olympia Sydons from Opastrakar,Unova hall of fame huge name in my contact and she is exactly Mist with psychic/ghost/dark and she receives 9.5 minutes 6 times as well(all laugh) just too good and i’m in contact with almost all gym leaders in Kalos and Unova(all laugh) those who really were great and wated that many actually was thet i humiliated them and all but Unova now you know different story and Mrs Olympia was saved cause she gagued the situation well but the one man () from () that i had no contacts with cause he is just a too great man for me to even ask anything and the whole world knows him and he will be back to joviality next term getting prepared only and he wasn’t contacted cause he said distinctly that you have got nothing to learn from me cause i’m nothing to you and you i’ll remember in 1000 years as only once i saw cause to be honest you may get to the bushes and thus lose it i don’t want that and thus only by luck i’ll meet when you may return for your Elite4 and i just want to remember this moment and that’s all i’ve got nothing to learn from you cause i’ll do it 1000 years later remind me then only he paved my way to cut off my ego and was single whole life lived at a totally different sphere ever told them legends can only be befriended his Latios was trying to do that with Chu just not enough and all and he will return as the great Jovial pokemon master once in 2000 and that’s who he is so later i visited during a Sunday in Elite4 first thing i did after that Kalos incident had some chats on philosophy and all so much to learn told him about my 3 classes there and then i wated to live such a life he said many unbelievable things and all and just wated to see Chu who was serious but then i showed Giratina whom he had and that joviality i told he said that was even better than 1000 and he was so happy that he could see that cause he ever thought that was possible and will see that later he said had many things to say and me too was abstract though both of us and was a grand experience and the whole reason i went to Unova and will do so again but this time with Mist if he asks to had he been here but had he been here he would’ve just called me and gave forced them to get full general govt support so that the humans were taken care of the rest is too easy would’ve never been undercover except the general Unovan govt themselves being involved had he been consulted with and you know that means Mist would’ve been assured that i will return and could contact me every day cause no battle would’ve taken place anyway coming to Melody i ever felt an affection for her later especially now i realize that she was May absolutely just way more frank,nice and jovial her unnecessary friendliness to me after Johto and all was may be she wanted to travel with me at Hoenn or something i don’t know but ever was too friendly with me to nice in i was at Hoenn and she Kalos ever said can’t concentrate i ever told her just focus on your bunch and i didn’t have a clue that Kalos is the grand Kalos and neither did she else would’ve been at Hoenn or Sinnoh atleast or even Unova which is still better than Kalos and may be she needed more help i feel bad for her in that way but anyway Melody was like that and this 54-57 minutes/month still believed me that i was a good friend despite my outer attitude,so said that when i was in Unova still and my show offs to her had nothing to do with our relation cause she was first hand victim of those brats att both places so she was fine and all else just a hesitation except many though Sabrina never had that being from Kanto,Rosen at Johto psychic gym never,Houston at Sinnoh a fire gym never,Kent Ground gym,Hoenn never,Verginia from Kalos of all places that too rock type gym of all gyms where i used Hawlucha(all laugh) still even there never bothered and there most thought i was so egotistical and all Virginia says just the air gets a bit heavy if your bunch wants to play and not battle(all laugh) famous gym you may know or not given it’s Kalos(all laugh) but that kid Foster was contacted from there by me and Virginia knows each rock gym in the world(all laugh) Foster heard about her then spoke Virgina now says doesn’t he take his wife out sometimes for personal professionality(all burst into laughter) then 153 in Sinnoh 100 has fled the scene or very minimal contact once a month weather report(all laugh) but the rest 90 all hall of fame still the same,Hoenn 96 and 65 fled as soon as went to Unova(all laugh) then detectives were after me(all laugh) rest same and this is except Pettelsburg,Unova 200 fled 100 stays(all laugh) but yeah now the situation is totally different there Mrs Olympia i ever contact said Mark is all about showing Persy the low(all laugh) then Kalos 150 fled(all laugh) and 80 remains,Johto 76,48 has fled(all laugh) and rest remained 28 including Anabel(all laugh) Kanto 12 all remains except one(all laugh) cause that one is breaching negetive circles now(all laugh)..right(all laugh),then in Orange of all places(all laugh) 17,3 fled the scene(all laugh) 14 remains and all the hall of fames there remains i did 12 and sadly includes Danny boy and Rudy lad(all laugh) who are unique samples in this world(all laugh) their alibie to the whole world is that 1.the welcoming rounds first fetches more tourists for the islands(all laugh) 2.Ah man it’s just the Orange(all laugh) both of their wives has been fed up saying don’t then whin at home why you don’t get hall of fame(all laugh) no those brats at HQ,we’ll show them how many have won the preliminary rounds(all laugh) still Rudy does only one Danny says 3 rounds win 2 minimum(all laugh) then there itself tries to give the badge(all laugh) and Rudy decides from a boat trip which pokemons are to be used(all burst into laughter) it’s like Brawn i said so many times why ever 1 on 1 ‘AH! Kid when you grow up you’ll realize the fun in racing a bike on one wheel(all laugh) but i said don’t you want great challengers that you will get if you just allow them to give you the special distinction if not the hall of fame ‘AH!kid not all are hall of fame material you know so why bother life is but a dream enjoy to the most with that joyous scream(all burst into laughter)’ so i realized this old goon doesn’t even want to understand what is hall of fame(all laugh) and now so happy with the things that were given and 3 Cities cup and all says 1 on 1 how about a Zekrom for your 1st badge(all laugh) Timmy his son in contests i have too much contacts with him as does SPEW(all laugh) Timmy says that’s why i’ve got nothing to do with general training(all laugh) and so on are the gyms but many who fled are coming back one by one a few contacted and all few places change of guard and all i just hope 1247 gym leaders doesn’t jump me(all laugh) Foster is ever welcome,Sabrina has to be pestered(all laugh) and Pettlesburg is just my home but(all laugh) well out of 1247 one gym leader is too close to me(all laugh)..right(all burst into laughter),infact all asked me at Unova,Sinnoh and Kalos that you either don’t consider a gym leader or too respectful which one worked for her(all laugh) i said none just that age(all burst into laughter) then Persy asked me don’t you two fake battle(all laugh) i said um..Persy just the opposition platform if i look at(all laugh) Persy laughed and said tell my beau this(all laugh) any vacation full match must be held(all laugh) prize is if Samantha wins,Persy will do her officibal works for next day(all laugh) and the other way around is(laugh) Samantha agree and PROPERLY prepare to go to a date without Nick their 6 year old son(all burst into laughter) but i will soon spoil both cause they are just so naive(all laugh) that FEELING(all laugh,Brock laughs shaking his head) this is from the crook(all laugh) ever remember 2nd day we were at mount moon the rockets jump us and a researcher was there forgot his name crazy guy(all laugh) then Brock caught a Zoobat i was so upset(all laugh) then whole day all things go on at night moon dance and then Mist was too close to me(all laugh) and all things go next day or two days later can’t recall i got Bulbasaur and he was extremely hard to get then tame(all laugh) then while taming i ask why some are so hard to tame says,no no apparent reason but one should stick on not give up that sets the men from boys and also some pokemons are like that too you can’t point that thing it’s just can’t be expressed in a word just that FEELING(all laugh)..never can forget that stuff(all laugh) and no not all the gym leaders were in contact i would’ve gone crazy then(all laugh) it was half the numbers approximate but now all 1246 wants me(all laugh) even Blanie,Giovanni and Ackgel(all laugh) Sabrina is normal(all laugh) Mr Maple is there,() gym now renovated Harmonica his cousin’s daughter now is there gym leader and she contacts me each week thrice(all laugh) if not talk still has to text of mail(all laugh) and she is a 3 time champ double Unova and Orange(all laugh) then Foster the Great Professional is there(all laugh) and the other is my Mist flower..right(all laugh),then Mr Maple of all people whom i contacted sometimes never was bothered about anything going on around my public image but ever cautioned me against the pests but very briefly but firmly which were so helpful cause i was going full Madgaleo at times and had my bunch caught that irritation in my mind could’ve attacked literally anyone,anyway those who hesitated i said,look you all are in positions just search up my professional activities and then if you think i’m all show off,you’re free to cut off,which always worked cause my Chu-bro did that Sinnoh miracle and all knew they’ll only get benefitted so stayed on...anyhow back to this Melodious brat(all laugh)..’Ash,that Misty and this Misty,can you believe it?’(all burst into laughter)...this is after 50 minutes of professional talk(all laugh)..brat needed a rest(all laugh)..and this is just after my break-up(all laugh)..before the Brock and jackal incident(all laugh)..Brock well no matter what was alright in the sense atleast a damn brat hasn’t left asylum still(all laugh) but the jackal was only cause he’s a jackal(all laugh) jackal i told be professional yeah but Misty(all laugh)..’um..Misty means..”(all laugh)..’Ash,Misty Waterflower or who your travel companion at Johto,then absolutely nothing and now amusing,amusing(all laugh)’...’oh,that Misty(all laugh)..well yeah,Misty was ever good with water pokemons but you see i didn’t see her in 8 years(all laugh)..so i don’t know what happened in between,but heard her name so yeah just very happy to know’...now  the brat goes into overdrive(all laugh)..’Ash,please i understand break-ups(all burst into laughter),you two were like married couples while dancing(all laughs uncontrollably)..and she saw us dancing once for 10 minutes 9 years back(all laugh)..i still remember it was amusing(all laugh)..nobody can dance so freely with a girl unless she’s your very long time girlfriend or more like wife(all laugh)...yeah,yeah,professional(all laugs uncontrollably)...so must’ve heard about her Gyarados(all laugh uncontrollably)?’,’yeah,right Gyarados well..(all burst into laughter)’...but this brat was cunning(all laughs uncontrollably)...how many hours of study MR. Fox(all laugh)?”
Tracey(laugh) : “exactly 18(all burst into laughter).”
Misty(frown) : “hey,hey you jackal(all laugh)..don’t look at my hubby,don’t call at him(all burst into laughter),don’t try to mingle with his bunch(all burst into laughter),don’t make sketches of him with yourself(all laugh)..Brock,why do grown up namecalled old-men look at my Ash?”(all burst into laughter)..”
Brock(laugh) : “well,because of his professional contacts(all burst into laughter)...and he’s so sweet,sweet,cute,their dream,they want to fondle hi,um..hug..um..no..no(all burst into laughter)...”
Misty(hugging Ash firmly,bit agitated,Ash tenders her laughing) : “SHUT UP! he’s only my Ash...um..(all burst into laughter)..Ash why do they disturb us(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “cause you’re sweet little Misty sis(all smile)..see no talk till jealousy(all laugh,Misty frowns at Ash hugging him firmly then smiles and rests her head on his shoulder,Ash smiles at her and keeps tendering her)...is smacking me(all laugh)...too(all laugh) sweet...but(all laugh) Brock,exactly as you said the REASON(all laugh),only a crook can get it instantly(all burst into laughter)...so this cunning Melody(all laugh) almost sobs(all laugh) : “Ash,how to become so professional like you(all uncontrollably laughs)..he..he..that girl..that..(all burst into laughter)..’,’mam(all laugh)..this is shrew the Drew method for pests(all laugh) the tone is also his(all laugh)..shame ’mam(all laugh)..yes we have professional contacts for 9 years,and yes,we understand your concerns(all laugh),but ‘mam please,we were talking about regenerating hypnosis(all laugh)...”,and she actually did break down(all laugh)...so i was just laughing in my mind that such is emotion you know,no matter what i thought i had broken up and Melody is a 3 time champion with elusive name still no matter out of profession and then was so successful and look here all over the place, just one hand on her shoulder,and that’s it(Misty smiles at Ash,Ash reciprocates)...to her it’s a beau for life AGAIN but to me despite of my relationship status i only wanted to stop her crying whom i’ve known for ages like my sis and this is what that was for differentiate bro and beau(all smile) and yeah i’ve known her but only professionally and such a great successfull person is breaking down to a virtual stranger cause some brat did something so i just politely said that,’please,this is a public place no matter who comes here,and it was that great club at Safforn private cell, and you’re household name in our profession here they’ll drag you through all dirts possible just calm down it’s alright..’ so the brat calms down and says what her beau did proposed first then went off the grid with someone who was the target all along around our champ for neutrition and our champion too followed suit in grids with another brat soon cause the triangluar great pryed upon her and that 2nd great also followed suit around grids with non-chamipons the first wasn’t physical the 2nd was then the same brat just made a face later found out a different story..a perfect unit of complex combination within 2 and half years too much bonhomie....perfectly learnt from Kalos,which was her 4th region and killed off such a talent completely 2.5 years too much there from 21 to 24 is 3 months older to me though reached round 4 only and the concentration never there and then Unova hardest region again 2 and half years just 1st round 6 best pokemons off in 19 minutes,came back at 26 around settled for a bit obvious talent helps that stuff then gets in a great triangle all because of her talents that never could be hidden no matter what and that too with an Alakazam and a Uxie but the other two side arms had other intensions and they infact were instantly happy just threw her in the tomb and that’s it..never go to Kalos if you’re from Johto-Kanto circle till your 5th region atleast and never before you complete battle-frontier where you see many villege competitions as well and face challengers there and hence know your own regional grassroot professions more to strenghten your values and if you’re not mentally very strong then make that very last region by then you’ll be 31 atleast,and may be even married and all much better...cause people will come up to husband and wife,’calls by name lets have a bang hey,leave him ever old,change it a bit old will then reinvigorate else ever divorce’..yeah,exactly this language  and also the physical behaviour polite to them may be but not so to me atleast and happily agreed cause they’re good friends and no not mutual cause the husband was formally talked with and he happily lets his wife go nothing matters unless physicality..and the husband is told..’hey,come on sunshine lets have a night,let her go she’s alright,going with her everyday get separated’..this too i heard again not mutual i guess..and actually that brat VIA her parents insinuated here ‘a just a moment just a mistake very bad yes but doesn’t make anyone unfaitfull’...to them if you do all around without vulgarity,which you understand what they are saying and THAT,hardly a trouble..and vulgarity applies for married couples only not the other way around hence it got too medious here,both brats were avid followers here..exactly why never send people there unless they’re matured or strong enough and i guess Cerulian was trying their hands at it too but it’s Knato so a bit hard,takes caution..and thus my endeavours to that brat and here too,takes caution..(laugh)...had lady Dawn been there after Sinnoh Brock(Brock laughs and shakes his head)..only the pokemons are absolutely the best and the outside our profession is top in the world ONLY academically and other sections too i guess,but people mostly are like that in general unless they are above 35 or something...very carefully mingle with people there cause even true good people their values are totally different,you have to force your dignity only then they’ll realize you which takes ages in this matter like it did with Clemont and then they themselves will protect you from pests,i had to go for a date there cause it was first and that brat was all over to get it so her friend was chosen,got the treatment,Clemont later asks,i chide him to maximum for a full hour saying why i feel what i feel,realizes always handled that brat and other pests but never himself realized that stunt thought just a brat and never realized me fully too,later understands what’s gonna happen just calls me and all i tell him not to mingle personally but you’re way younger to me by 7 long years so you’re of the age of many gym leaders who were little kids when i met them in first two regions or 3 and they are now recent leaders and to them i’m like a big bro and in that way you the same always will be ever in this life and will have all helps that’s plausible and possible from me to my best capasity but these don’t include my personal life at all thus you need not to know one thing about it and you realize all the rest cause i know you extremely well and how truely good you’re at heart but i’ll be professional to you utmost till i want that veil to be lifted you’re free to choose your side and/or keeping this contact at all but i’ve the very best fervant wishes,said he’ll keep contacts for sure and will be personal from his side as well so i said fine later thus has been fed to Mr Oak(laugh),he was 25 when i met him now 30,1 year younger to senor and then he has had a strange kind of career cause he went to engineering concerned to the instruments and finished by 24 a stupendus academic career at the best University in his engineering strem at whole Kalos and then a great professional always interested about pokemons so got a job related to that in instruments but then at 26 decided to try training so from 26.5 to 27 formal studies and then from 27 to 27.25 travelled Kalos,starter was Treecko then got a Tangela but was undecided on what is to be done so aborted his journey after just 2/3 months just and wasn’t really confident then went back to work released Tangela but Treecko was of course kept then worked for 6 months or 7 but he was excellent in work and his first company gave him a salary that would've been like quadruplued and that itself was stupendus level yet gave that up just for his love for pokemons and so on a true honest and good guy to his very core so could do these and did get the second job still similar type but somehow the travelling around lured him and was out again then met me when he was 28 me 32,was out for a month or so then was at the lab where i first went spoke and knew my name the whole world did,the lab themselves told and i saw tremendus academic career and hence just came along his skills helped me there to the extent that i would've had to abort my journey had he not been there cause too many people pestered my bunch and i in that condition would've lost my head and turned on everyone but he was very calm ever was beside me in these matters and was like Cili at Unova and then we were travelling and and had a very detailed talk with me after the first month itself when he was still trying to be a trainer and got a Seedot but was unsure again and all that then had a talk and understood that training isn’t for him so Seedot was released cause never wanted to be with him but Treecko was very well tamed but he didn’t fondle his starter like Trace has(laugh) so Treecko can battle atleast but rather like a Pidgey as well though the potential is there of a Sceptile and then he was after one month totally focused on observations and studies and all and in 3/4 years has really escalated in his career i’m so happy for that and his girlfriend Megan now as well same profession and lab and same age as well,she is the physical suppliment specialist from Kalos as well and she is in same field as Mia is and she went to breeding and suppliment studies that gruelling 8 year course more so cause she did all at a time and with one more upto 24 and then travelled Kalos for 2 and Unova of all places for another 2 in between completed another 1 to get all degrees and else and all in 29 just like Mia has done and then joined the same lab and Clemont did the same already working there for 3 years Gary knows Ms Megan Bromstrong pretty known figure in certain circles in suppiment research area really and Clemont the same in instrument section i actually told him after he decided to focus on this that why still travel with us go to some labs said no your bunch intrigues me with the intelligence and then with the power and all here itself i’ll learn a lot and this bug of travelling around Kalos isn’t leaving me so that as well so sticked around then went and in 3 years really has been superb and he was right abolutely certainly my bunch and discussions did help him in his way and he helped a lot with those pests that were trying to test me every moment cause he knew what they were upto in a way though he only worked for 2.5 years total and knew very little but great intuition and enthusiasm so was great and travelling like that to 230 and 72 top notch places getting a Heatran,Darkrai,Zeraora,Zygarde and Deoxys five psudeo-legends and then the way i got them and who they have become as the real self that they are and still the same phenomena with Lycanroc,Malamar,Dusknoir and Incineroar especially how she just came all by herself without absolutely anything from me and then of course Greninja that phenomena that a pokemon came then stayed then released then again came back then again released then again finally decided to stay with us and heightened her powers like that that really made him decide that he will take up the job at a starter lab but only after my travel finished and all these buddies of mine helped him to that unique position as to others were rather from general universities and all he is though knows pokemons first hand and saw a bunch that’s not going to be seen again in his lifetime atleast and so has been served very well and that was some experience for me as well and he is 33 now pretty well established and Megan too at 33 now fully professional in her area and are happy with everything about themselves and each other personal and professional and Bonnie too little ever understood that i was a mythical creature cause of that name was 15 when met me left at 17 now in university and all she was just a little kid but still extremely stady just like Max was and senor was just that the childhood nonsense suddenly gripped her at old age and escalated but still except that very very nice person no doubt and steady as well never trekked like that and then that travel never complained and i just wished had the brains to have a discussion and not jump like that and no my mental states didn't help her or family either anyway,doesn't matter just best wishes and Celmont was professional but in a different way only he had some trekking experience but just 2 months or 3 so i told him everything what to do when i trekked and i went to volcanos with 2 day old Heatran(laugh) Kalos was a totally different experience to me and Clemont perfectly understood my bunch’s position out of rest two one just the glory and nothing else and Bonnie was just a mere kid so strange experience really but may be that was good cause Clemont’s skills were very very important to me then actually most essential without him would've had to hire someone infact thus the journey would've never been possible and i was who i was cause of my bunch it was a matter of myself i’ve known my bunch’s position since Unova completed it's first anniversay during the journey in the second year and the implications so it was just about me so that was exactly what i needed in Kalos and that is why i was so lucky there as well,anyway to return to the bratting,Sinnoh and Orange will pull that stunt but will have the decency to do it in absolute privacy or among very close 3/4 friends max,Hoenn only in full privacy but it will be a stunt still,Unova varies from place to place somewhere like Johto,somewhere like worst Kalos though those places are least in comparison and yeah that incident with me was in such a place but generally not in public but in close friends party may be during parting 3/4 will get tripled,still much better,Cili is an exception really cause his place is worst Kalos,now shifted of course can’t stay there such a man in a profession like breeding so many people will come up...Kanto the best only in full privacy and never a stunt has to be mutual with distinct signs shared for a span otherwise just a long hug no vulgarity,Johto in full privacy but a mere infatuation will do it may be not always mutual but very rare with not so much distinct signs and span and all and will be tolerated still cause among best friends can happen only still no vulgarity,which only can happen in Unova and Kalos and places in Sinnoh...i say this cause you all know about me and Mist and no doesn’t matter what we are,but first wasn’t done,second only one person was there who by then was mutual big-bro very own and 5 years older no way a friend or even a coach or mentor,third all privacy was tried first and fourth and most important we both were together for 5 long years 24/7 and showed distinct signs for atleast 4 and half and most importantly both our families knew everything in full details that too can only happen in Kanto in such cases and only then did that moment appear and never before...this all cause you know(laugh) legends are anywhere now-a-days may be next week Bernetur 1000 will be at Cerulian(laugh)..anyway,the north-east region in Kalos is much much better though more like Hoenn and not even Sinnoh in general cause they are detached mostly so homely so the values are stronger,and that’s why Jim that kid was allowed in the gym being his first region also was my fan and all and yeah was excellent for first region a long way to go really has that thing to go beyond 5 absolutely if keeps right and was way more polite compared to the brats from other parts of the region i saw there,other bunch i’ll personally counsel the brat then only let him or her in especially if first 3 regions otherwise for female brats Safforn also gives them the hall of fame and male versions straight to the hall of fires at Cinnaber and thus both versions won’t be seen again in Kanto,Persy and his beau were approached with this issue during Elite4,says its public culture they can’t do much except restrictions..all good hall of fame people atleast like that Jim kid..much polite in 1st and 2 nd then 3rd understands themselves and eventually perfect persons....Persy started with Kalos,Kalos-Frontier,Sinnoh,Hoenn,Johto,Unova,Kanto,Orange then 7-0...all wins and ever so down to earth person, Samantha his wife as well from Hoenn actually, Hoenn,Sinnoh,Orange-couldn’t win,Hoenn-Frontier,Johto,Unova,Kanto-couldn’t win,Persy did(laugh),lost to him in semis(laugh,all smile) then Kalos...met in Kanto and then Persy had to wifesist her in Kalos for reimburshment of the loss for a full year then only was allowed to lesserly go to Orange while his new wed-wife completed the hall of fame(laugh,all smile)...so they realize the concern and well as Nigel but yeah they can’t do much really...really within 35 and half complete all these..very difficult for sure but no excuses if one can’t learn form own bunch’s behavious to you and others at all(all smile)...anyway,(laugh) all these again as i say the more the better because of course tomorrow 100 suffix Cycloturnotics’ are coming to Cerulian with 200 suffixes in a brigade of 1000(laugh)...never know,anyway,so i realized her melodious concerns and then said please i’m a stranger to you why so emotional get a hold just makes a face says ‘if that’s professional what is friendship i’ve known you for so many years barely saw you twice or thrice,hardly spoke more and once a week almost all on pokemons never bothered to tell your life i rather told you a bit and you never asked yet never stopped talking no matter what i didn’t want to talk with you but you compelled me to keep that may be 6 times a month contact for 5 minutes each for 9 long years all because you remembered that moment i beat you and now you’re so much above everyone still doesn’t matter and your discussions helpes me everyday for the last 9 years,my personal friends so many left me but you just don’t bother at all to you i’m still the one who beat you all the 9 years back and you’ve won everything in between and has a bad public image yet you don’t bother about anything at all,even today you’re not at all bothered about personal lives and no to me you’re not a stranger but the best teammate i’ll ever have because you’ll remind me before i die that whatever lets talk about pokemons,so that is special and i can just about say anything but that will corrupt our relation then cause you’re not going to budge by any means to talk about anything except the profession and in the last 9 years you never bothered about anything we’ve stayed exactly there’ and so on and this exact nature had got me into many troubles cause all weren’t like her and so on(all smile)..certainly none in my profession in Kalos(laugh)..but anyway,(laugh)..that’s Melody for you Brock,professional-phone-8-minute-6/month-contact-friend,but look at the turn of future(laugh)...i go undercover without anyone in the world knowing except Trevor and John and thus none knows me except Sabrina who realized that not for nothing i spent 3 nights at Safforn forest with 8 ghost types including Gengar and so on,so she thought i might be doing something legal or illegal but Sabrina just doesn’t bother at all and goes on in the meantime our sweet Melody contacts her saying what happened to Ketchum,to which she said none knows may be something illegal,that’s the right thing to say cause if i’m legal and alive i’ll come out but if it’s mentioned that i’m legal,i’m done... so does that Melody picks up the clue and just tells Sabrina that if she ever meets me again just to tell that Melody was truely happy to see a so and so man and that’s it...so anyway,then finally greatest wisdom dawns upon the greatest boss that he has a bit more fun left to enjoy here so i come out alive and all my contacts return though they were strictly told not to discuss about undercover or else they’ll be reported if i wanted to so then i did get the brat back but she was extremely professional to me for next two years then the next few months said going out of profession will get married and so on and then that really was that wished her best but again 4 lunatics sabotaged 103 battelions to send all contacts underground but i hear about those contacts show me Trace i do know very well that you surely do know me?”
Tracey(solemn) : “pretty much,just doesn’t want to contact you and no never contacted Misty either,stay professional for next 6 years happily married with her husband for 3 years John Harrison,double Kanto champ also from Safforn,who is in profession same thing he did in Safforn but way more in demand like how Melody was at Safforn he is similar now at Levender psychic type specialist as well mostly the dark ones as you know and has a son of 2 and another born 3 months back also a son,Levender,herself not involved professionally anymore for 3 years now thus also doesn’t have any reasons to contact but still no grudge on only teammate when it’s about profession which can change cause 1.you had crossed the barrier through profession itself thus it overflows and overfloods everything and 2.about a few others as usual they eavesdropped and your state is universally known as well atleast to Gym leader hall of fame and thus the rest is understandable as Telplocus too is universally known thus they don’t bother cause they have much respect that you’re no more a professional outside temporarily which we all want to become permanent outside the 3 city circle or Pettlesberg but i’m afraid that’s not why we started today,so Ash,we’d wish to restart the gym battling...
Ash(laugh) : “right Trace but the brat that leaked both the newses VIA Trevor of all people(burst into laughter)...true brat..anyway,i’m ever in profession Trace you all know ever will be it’s just that the right preparations must be given to me and protection that my wife will be able to talk to me each day not incognito and will see me again guranteed that is get the govt involved and that’s it as you all know Kanto govt has my back and thus atleast here i’m fine though Kanto govt is the bigger version of Indigo Platue anyway,Trace fine,i’ll get into the mood but please if you can spare the time and the patience don’t..”
Gary(laugh) : “hm...Ashey-Boy..hm...,Ash,we don’t bother and i surely don’t just get us back to the mood to show that that was fake show.”
Ash(laugh) : “perfect Gary,so let me remember...Brock,i’m sorry for the wrong turn but..”
Brock(smile) : “you’ve always turned the upside down man,this one’s the same Misty,just continue...”
Ash(laugh) : “right,the first thing i’ll do is to swear everything off cause these emotions were obviously not melodious at all...thus, a great date,my only with someone other than my sweetie in Kalos as i said what goes on there..so the brat goes in, “Ash..i’m..”,”Mr Ketchum,’mam”,’um..Ash..”,” ‘Mam,i’m a 5 league champion and you surely know the rest/i’m 6 years older to you,surely i know the best/you think that you’re friend knows me well,and i’m ever friendly/but mam please relaize that personally i’m pretty deadly’..(laugh)..this word gets the brat totally confused cause she doesn’t understand which side to sail to cause it’s totally contradictory cause my disposition and word and behaviour doesn’t match at all(laugh)...right that’s the sweet music..still continuing though...the brat gets overjoyed and tries to sit beside me(all laugh)...’,’SHAME ‘mam(all laugh),right you heard,sit where you did/’mam please let me finish,cause that’s exactly thy need(all burst into laughter)/so see ‘mam all this glory,this power,this much fame/never nothing is ever there without me where’s my name?’(all burst into laughter)...now the brat gets the Greninja’s Kalos Wisdom from a friendly-looking-venerable-deadly(all burst into laughter) who has won 55 hall of fame gym badges among required 88(all laugh) in 6 months(all laugh) and all best hall of fames in 6 months(all laugh) on the way to his 6th league and got the rocket defused to friendship(all laugh)..so she finally sits down politely(all laugh)..and says “um..sorry but..”,’halt there ‘mam,right there,it’s an honour to talk to you(all burst into laughter)/sand is ever as you madam,but the word is same that’s shrew(all uncontrollably laughs)/’mam i know you know a lot the whole world is only a pot/but the trouble as i see ‘mam it breaks just takes that one shot(all bursts into laughter)’...the brat is totally dead now(all laugh)..says,’um..Ash can we talk Pokemons’(all burst into laughter),’yeah surely Midet..that was the name...surely,so you see rotonob-pshycogomic-tycroptin-darkened Mewtwo...’(all burst into laughter)...this gets that buffoon to almost fell off her seat(all laugh) first a Mewtwo to being with(all laugh)..then doesn’t have one clue about what those are(all laugh)...and the opponent was raftus-progomoic-cystus-Arceus(all burst into laughter)...just the greatest boss said(all laugh)..Team Rocket’s signature was..a Mewtwo for a day/if an Arceus is added with where’s your way out of bay(all laugh)..says,’um..Ash..um..’(all laugh),’you see Midet,this is what you have to know to begin with(all burst into laughter)’...then i talk about dragon-dark types(all laugh)..and their infightings(all laugh)..what an hour that was..the brat said it’s ok i’ll not take anything(all laugh uncontrollably)..was fed by sentimantal brat friendship card(all laugh) all were green veg dishes(all burst into laughter)..then comes out our brat was dissapointed cause Midet got the date(all laugh),’hmm..so quick(all burst into laughter),the brat ate up some random guy for 1 and half hours and we were waiting outside for 30 minutes(all laugh)..now i was talking about all sorts of things of a Claffable(all burst into laughter)...which the brat again was almost puked(all laugh)..cause all knows moon dance but then it was shown to be too complicated(all laugh)..then our brat asks why quick,’um..thanks,thanks legendary(all laugh),bye brat,i’m in a hurry(all burst into laughter)...then our brats say,’Ash,what did you do to her(all laugh)’,’brat,have you ever heard of subgenetic testalight phyroblofic thyropnatic trycoon thunder attack(all burst into laughter)...thats Raftosmoric of course(all laugh)’...none of these names of course Clemont doesn’t know either(all laugh)...this one great illusive legend later faced our planing master Feraligator(all burst into laughter)...and you know the legend will be confused forever about type difference(all laugh)...Feraligator said,i see where are your mates,this gets gets the legend very angry that first a water type and then Feraligator is in the bottom of bottom half with thier natural type strenghts...so tries to charge at him and you know what charge means for such a legend,’i see you’re mates have forsaken you for strenght(all burst into laughter)’...this gets the legend a bit confused what is he talking about(all laugh)...’no no,i realize,lets talk about how to get back to your mates then(all burst into laughter)...’,the legend retorts like,’what the hell are you trying to get at’,’see,this whole type difference stuff is very fishy(all laugh)...then goes on with his type difference and different attack plans on different types long lecture then asks the lengend to dance(all laugh)...’,’the legend says like,’are you a pokemon(all laugh)’...’see,i’ve plans on pokemon dnacing(all laugh) how to increase the type advantage’(all laugh)...the legend is utterly confused with this cause now the brats wants to know everything about the legend despite knowing the type disadvantage much better than the legend(all laugh)...so the legend says what do you want(all laugh)...’i’m trying to have an understanding on how to plan your friendship back to your group but unless this type differnce is sorted out then its so hard cause you can’t know your own type then and then you can’t be be what advantages or disadvantages you have to get back to your friends without knowing how to cajole them saying how your specific type is good by-the-way do you dance at home(all burst into laughter)? No type difference influences dances and viseversa the more..(all laugh)..’ so finally the legend realizes he has to attack or else this brat will irritate him to death..well i don’t know what gender the legend was actually...anyway,so the legend again tries to attack...’i see too eager(all burst into laughter)..are you sure the plan you have is the same when you’re irritated with yourself when you think that had another plan to eat less i would’nt have had this stomach ache here and there when i tried to pester my friend too much and he and he mouthed me thus this headache(all burst into laughter)..do you dance(all burst into laughter)..(all laugh)...now the legend is totally flattened cause he’s telling him do you attack yourself when you have headache cause you ate more or your beau mouthed you(all laugh) or when you’re depressed cause you’re dumped(all laugh) cause Ferlaigator hasn’t done one thing to anyone and asking him to dance to get over the depression if any(all laugh) and always teaching him how to get back to his mates using his knowledge and then dancing it out..all laugh..and look at the intelligence,never one thing said that will make the legend believe that he’s trying to set the legend upon the legend’s master but just talks about being back to his friends to hit the spot that the legend is not among his own race and thus not able to have maximum fun with type advantages(all laugh)...so finally the legend gets it that he’s just fooling around innocently and only trying to become his friend and play has not one intention to battle cause he knows he can’t win it and doesn’t bother about it at all and thus the signal that all my buddies gave that we’re no match for you but you’re foolish to attack us cause we aren’t here to battle at all rather you’re charging for no reason what-so-ever,so the lunatic master is here again and is psychid off and then this Raftosmoric was using pshychic attacks and of course Feraligator or anyone can’t be harmed with that at all so the legend realizes and that’s why they are legends that the only difference this guy has is all his limitations in type difference and thus he’s wanting to understand all things about it cause he’s as good as the legend in psychic  defense..so the legend was rather trying to tach later(all laugh)..but then you weak and all so went off later but Gary i tell you Raftosmoric has big chance cause he’s the only to get the best planning treatment and loved it,Lillie how about an electric elusive legend for a starter(all laugh)?”
Lillie(laugh) : “will misbehave in the gym(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “so better change profession(all laugh)..AH BEAUTY,BEAUTY(all laugh)..that’s most dangerous though(all burst into laughter)..anyway,Team Rocket was very close with two legends and their whole system against Raftosmoric but ultimately got overpowered with exactly that attack which the legend only used once cause she didn’t want to throw them off cause Mewtwo and Arceus together was nothing to her tha’s a certain form of thunder-chair but that’s psychic type thunder of some degree not highest at all..which you know(all laugh)...then both travel companion brats realized it’s a wastage of time to talk with me,then Clemont was chided but i was way more polite then(all laugh)...what a night..anyway,so i’ll start with my Johto journey,but please i realize that my sweet bug now changed her style a bit after she returned from Johto,but is there really any chance that ponytails will return?..let me give you the answer Gary,Brock,Mr Fox(all laugh),from there...so this time Melody beats me and i could see the bug.my sweet ponytail knew that i was praising her and all that so didn’t like the fact i’ll go there and in 5 years i never saw her that dejected,then something happened this too Brock you never knew(laugh)...that day evening before party did i sent you away or did you flee the scene(all laugh)?”
BROCK(LAUGH) : “perfectly in-between(all laugh).
Ash(laugh) : “alright with this new dawn approaching(all laugh),may we please approach to the next tme in the play when we meet as you know my 3 little babies will be swearing you otherwise(all laugh)...so Mr jackal(all laugh),anytime.good noon(all laugh,reciprocate etc...)
....................................................................................................................................................
(2 days later mid conversation,5,Tu)

Ash(laugh) : “Johto parting,Brock patered to save himself from Gyaradosing(all laugh) so i see her so dejected first due to loss then due to my praising other people and third the brat liked me(all laugh)..was too close to me,shook hands patted me and so on and most dangerously HUGGED ME(all burst into laughter)..and i’ll come later what happens if i tell my bug that i have a girlfriend so thanks(all laugh)..this was the first day and it she was so deflated didn’t talk with anyone else and so on...and then we came back and my ponytail took her sweet garder off and wasn’t in the ponytail which meant two things either during the show here and all or while travelling she would do that to show that ‘my Ash’ should like me..that was the better friendly bug symbol that she wants me too hug her too sweetly so that she too would very emotionally fondle me...so,i knew that my bug was too sweetened and i came in and straight comes in hugs me quickly then holds my hands and cries her head off almost whispering and her voice is so sweet,‘um..Ash..i’m not a trainer like you..um..but..but..um..you saw me in the Whirl cup right Ash,i beat you there too,in the semi finals..that was a tough competition too..only water types..Ash,i too..um..defeated you..um..but i too..’(all burst into laughter)..and actually profusely cries so i reaized that my bug is now flowering up so i just said that ‘yeah,Mist..um..Misty(all laugh)..it was a great..”,”..SHUT UP(all laugh)..namecall competitor(all laugh) was a girl and i become Misty..Misty..then screams ‘I’m not Misty(all laugh uncontrollably)..Misty..you..(all laugh)..then breaks down completely..then we all know how sweet my sweetie’s voice is and then a few moments later so so sweetly in tears say..why are you calling me Misty,Ash..(all laugh)..and this is a very serious offence that all the time i must call her Mist unless someone asks me of her name(all laugh)..that too now must be said yeah my wife Mist,full name..(all laugh) so then again screams...Ash..how can you..again cries too much..Ash,5..5 year..then screams my name and totally breaks downs almost faints infact,’ well that was the end of 5 years actually and had she stayed for may be 1 more week we surely had to formalize the marriage(all laugh) IN MY ROOM(all laugh)..but Daisyl took her away!away,away,away(all laugh) Hence Daisyl is fed Crawdauntogatorlerphisontoadrottzellwhimscicrossleafquail(all laugh) and Conhoopa(all laugh)...so anyway, i hug her very quickly and STAY(all laughs)..then let go(all laugh)..and say ‘Misty,put your ponytail up then and only then you’re my best friend Mist(all laugh)”..these pleases my flower so much that she almost confesses and hugs too violently(all laugh)..thank God i drove the crook away(all laugh)..and yeah the Fox(all burst into laughter)..no that moment if were sketched all right still than a long grave lecture(all laugh)..and if the crook smelt that(all laugh)..then still now after 16 years he would’ve been writting philosophical novels on that(all laugh)..that FEELING(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,Brock shakes his head laughing)..so my flower giggles and hugs me doesn’t let me go and all and doesn’t say anything either(all laugh)...then i didn’t hug her back cause that would’ve been a bit too sweet for me at that moment(all laugh)...she doesn’t mind though(all laugh)...so i then  just pat her and say ‘Mist,we’ve been friends for 5 long years(all laugh)...we’ll always remain best friends(all laugh)...calm down,take rest i’ll have to go there later so lets talk about pokemons,hum?(all laughs)...my flower was too close for any comfort that day(all burst into laughter)...then looks into my eyes(all laugh)...’um..Ash..i..i..che..um..i..cher..um..’(all laugh)then again just hugs me and all...i again pat her back and say ‘right Mist,our friendship is too cherished by us(all burst into laughter)...best friends(all laugh)...’ she doesn’t say anything just keeps hugging and i keep patting her back and head now(all laugh) but just a few moments later my flower again gets sentimental... ‘Ash,why are you standing so far away’(all burst into laughter)...now i finally get to play my card that i wanted to for many days,i just quickly hug her(all laugh)..and hold her hand then and say,’Mist,can i do my best friend’s ponytail today?”(all burst into laughter)...this gets my flower to smile very sweetly and then she again hugs me and then asks,’um..when will Brock return(all burst into laughter)’..’well ample time but i also have to leave lets get on with the ponytail(all laugh)...then my flower tries to do her beauty tricks(all laugh)..but that was my real moment of magic that 15 years later actually was grasped,i say,’um..Mist,you generally don’t use these so why today are you using all these cosmetics and all these stuffs(all laugh)”...my flower doesn’t quite understand it(all laugh)..says,’um..you mean...then realizes the meaning and again hugs me and says...’Ash,you’re really my best friend(all laugh)..’..i replay..”always”(all laugh)..then again pats her cause in those moments hug means she’ll totally devour me up(all laugh)...then i do her ponytail which was the start only(all laugh)...later i was sweetened to gladly do a few others when i returned ALL FOR ME ONLY(all laugh)...but my thing was that i knew Mist extremely well except her hairs(all laugh)..yeah Trace and Brock both knows it 12 hours constantly looking at each other(all laugh) and then whole night(all laugh)..now i realized much later when my sis came in and she was my sis exactly but i realized her attitude with Drew and others and i was thinking then that 5 years and i never once thought that Mist was a girl actually(all laugh) and i had to keep a minimum distance(all laugh)..just looked like a girl(all laugh)..same to her never occured we’re any different and that’s why we know everything about each other so very well and that was like twin brothers or sisters no trouble at all..but of course the two dumb buffoons were arranging all the time(all laugh),then later realized the NOT-DESTINY(all laugh) and used their wisdom on her own sisters(all burst into laughter)..but Professor is Professor(all laugh)..2 words professor(all burst into laughter)..yeah,later that(all laugh)..so that day did it taking quite a bit of time(all laugh) and then again was upto the old day and this time mostly extremely dangerously for any comfort(all laugh)..we hugged and then i fondled the ponytail and my flower was tendering my hairs as well and just looking at each other no words and actually both were just trying to find the words only but neither wanted to say cause any words were disturbing then and we just continued and knew what we knew(all,smile)...but this,exactly this is the appolocalypse(all laugh)...if that moment continued for may be 5 more minutes and probably would’ve to 50 may be either of us would’ve definitely confessed out of impossibility of suppression and that confession would’ve been just to get married immediately after we returned cause later i realized that that really was the hug and the moment of married couple of 10 years,husband and wife after a month long separation due to works(all smile) but then most heinously, a certain crook says(all laugh)-> ‘too sweet hey?(all laugh)/till i’m here it’s at bay(all burst into laughter)/i’ll show you that it’s nay(all laugh)/either you marry,or i’ll play(all laugh)’...so of course as ever at the end there was no point in announcing my marriage to my wife after 20 years(all laugh) and while we both knew about it most vividly but only in intuition and hence our 4 year break-up trouble almost physically killed us both to get rid of the body from the way(all smile)..anyway,that doesn’t happen so the crook comes in,coughs and spits(all uncontrollably laughs)...says,’Ash are you going to the party?’..’what’s that Brock,what’s that?..MY ASH WILL NOT GO(all burst into laughter)...hum..WHY ARE YOU PESTERING HIM...(all laugh)...i’ll kill you(all laugh)...then i’ve to calm the bug down again but for the first time may be she took my side in front of friends with such emotion of a quarreled-and-patched-up wife(all burst into laughter)...anyway i hold her hands for minutes(all laugh)..calm her down and all then go.but Crook(all laugh)..cough it out(all burst into laughter)...”
Brock(laugh) : “no never these too fondling stories,behind my back(all burst into laughter),congrats Ash,14 year in due(all laugh)..Misty how was it(all laugh)?”
Misty(hugging Ash very firmly and smiling) : “just my Ash(all smile).”
Ash(patting Misty’s head,laugh) : “the Gym opened today finally after 3 days (all laugh)...too sweetened to stay away from husband during in-house work(all smile),so just quarter boiled Brock(all laugh)..caution(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “so anyway,Ash finally manages to go(all laugh),then
immediately Misty almost cries to me just after he leaves after
hugging and ponytailing her for 2:30 hours or so(all laugh) 'Brock,why
doesn't he like me?'(all burst into laughter) and
then after Ash returns first thing,'hum,too
melodious hum?' (all burst into laughter)..Ash,3 hour hard work all vapoured in 2:30 right(all laugh)
Ash(laugh) : “Mistyviously(all laugh)..that was liking now if 3 seconds away after gym shuts,‘hum..getting old right’(all laugh)..Mistyvious indeed(all laugh)..then..then the complain was...’too melodious hum..you’re having your dinner with me(all burst into laughter)...that was 22:30(all laugh)..i was 1 hour late at party(all laugh)...’Mist,i’m totally full..please,let’s..’ again gets into danger mood ‘WHAT DID SHE MAKE YOU EAT?(all burst into laughter)..hum.too much dancing..too much hugging..OR DID YOU DRINK TOO MUCH(all laugh)..hum you you....’..now i see that this is getting serious now so just say that ok,but tomorrow both lunch and dinner we’re going together ALONE(all burst into laughter) and tonight i’ll just take little dessert...calms down a bit...’huh?!?..finally 5 years wants to date(all laughs uncontrollably)..um..(all alugh)..a hangout(all burst into laughter)..yeah,yeah,fine YOU’RE PAYING(all burst into laughter)..12:30,20:30...AND I’’LL NEVER DATE YOU(all uncontrollably laughs)...the crook says,’um..’(all laugh),we both in unison say : “get out’(all laugh)...then we date it out the next day and the day after that and the day after that(all laugh)..not allowed to watch the final cause a certain person is there(all laugh)..but that party itself i passed 1.5 hours with that person(all laugh) and then later watched the reply of the final(all laugh)..Mist only knew after the 2 words(all laugh) then was ok of course(all laugh) no you know i just wish i was more kind to Melody and she was looking for a travel companion and wanted to go with me infact Mist then would’ve as well(all laugh) and i would’ve confessed to Mist that very night itself(all laugh) then the Daisyl’s plans would’ve been gone(all laugh) cause Brock would’ve been sent to Cerulian and that jackal would’ve been forced to come(all laugh) Professor ever says broaden the horizon(all laugh) and Brock had Toxicroak,Swampet and Ludicolo of all pokemons psychic-grass-water(all laugh) and he’s mad(all laugh) and Brock still has Magnezone,Shiftree(all laugh),Ninetails,Sudowoodo,Crobat,Chansy,Forretress(all laugh) that was some day first bug then steel direct advantage(all laugh) pulled Brock’s ears off and she was 18 Brock was 23(all laugh),but then Brock has of course Steelix and Golem(all laugh) well only Geodude ever and didn’t know what is electric(all laugh) like Marill doesn’t know what is psychic(all laugh) but all the rest evolved still cause they weren’t HUMAN(all laugh) 11 great pokemons really i ever told him get in rock and water competitions(all laugh) cause he needed only one more to get in grass,psychic and electric if only Geodude wasn’t fondled(all laugh) and Brock should’ve gym battled to let my flower go to me in Unova cause his 3 are enough for his one on one 3 times change(all laugh) cause all you need is that FEELING(all laugh) and i still remember in the last days of Johto before that we both had our ways to fight and get what we wanted forcing the other to budge stubbornly or to cajole each other sentimentally or to pat each other if we were depressed or in her case if she had to complain that Brock or Trace were not letting her pull their ears and hair(all laugh) and all but in the last month before the finals just couldn’t say no to her(all laugh)...to stricken(all laugh)...and during date won’t sit opposite but beside(all laugh)...always private cell(all laugh)...always that’s the custom cause we sat absolutely in proximity just enough not not to get enough close(all laugh)...the next day was final then another day then returned...actually i only came to know the responsibility mask(all laugh) only in those very last 5/6 days that what my flower will become cause i was talking about life outside the journeys and all and saw how gentle and caring she is about certain things and all...but all intuition and then had to part and all but the play is such that each moment is sweeter(all smile and .)..yeah,now only gym battle and the necessary,all else my job but i can’t be out of sight for more than an hour if urgent only else except physical needs 1 second(all laugh)..actually my favourite journey in terms of relationship and friends,etc was at my home in that break with my toffee-flower(all laugh)..but still personally Kalos will remain the best ever cause just what i formally learnt in all aspects and could test that on hand as i told you the situations there..anyway,so again when we were in parties,'ahm,excuse me Ketchum(all laugh),you've come here under my wing. remember that (all laugh)...'hum..rather you've come due to your intellect'(all laughes uncontrollably)...now this always gets the blossomed flower to absolute despondency that how can 'my Ash' say he is actually not 'my Ash'...this was the whole hellrounds as you know(all laugh) as i said if somehow ‘my Ash’ convinces that he’s not ‘my Ash’ or that ‘my Ash’ says i’m not his ‘my Mist’ it’s total pitch darkness hence ‘walk behind me’(all laugh)...as soon as she hears it,
she's so dejected that i have to leave the party immediately and fondle her to death (all laugh)...so she has little tears there and then i say why are you crying we can leave anytime if we don't like this it's just a formality... now you can understand the situation and we were 2 years behind the formal confession (all laugh)... somehow she says 'so cute the girls isn't it?(all laugh)..fine i'm leaving but you'll have to return as well(all burst into laughter)...yeah this is 21 year marriage stuff(all laugh) each party was very difficult in Johto(all laugh)...then she again cries 'hum...what did you say,hum(all laugh)... intelligence, intelligence (all laugh)...you stupid jerk what do you know about intelligence,you...'(all laugh)...then i realize the it was too intellectual for my sweet bug to handle(all burst into laughter) and say alright lets go or atleast lets go to an empty place all will see us..',then she finally comes to an empty area and grabs my hands and tries to sit on my head(all laugh) and all i say 'hey we were joking right,why get so sentimental?'(all laugh)...the word sentimental gets her even more distraught and this was the round of 32 party at Johto...then she sobbs 'you are my best friend (all laugh),how can you say that i'm here to see other boys who aren't friends(all laugh)...',and so on,then we have to politely hug it
out(all laugh)...that was the only time then in a
public place and thank God none saw us else with Johto i
could've been disqualified from the
championships for not disclosing that i’m married for 21 years(all
burst into laughter)...yeah so we hug-it-out
saying, 'sorry Mist,very sorry if you're hurt,but hey
we're best friends right(all laugh)... friends joke and
these things happen and you're my best friend(all
laugh),look at me Mist(all laugh),please stop crying and if you don't want we'll leave no trouble'...now this gets my flower in
her type advantage (all laugh)... first the hug,then
the BEST confession (all laugh) and then
sentiments so that i won't bug her again atleast till
the next day(all laugh)...so my flower sweetly
says,'yeah..um..no Ash, it's alright,you can stay,i'll
leave...i'm..um..not invited so..'(all laugh)...so then
i understand it and say alright i'll dance only with
you,fine then best friend'(all burst into
laughter)...'um..yeah... it's alright as you wish(all
laugh)...no we should go,we've been absent from
the hall for long(all burst into laughter)... let's
go,and yeah, you too are my best friend,Ash,more
than best...um..best friend..(all burst into
laughter)',then we enter the hall again and well to
my utmost delight i can't take my eyes off(all burst
into laughter) from my better than all friend(all
laugh) and danced a bit,which i forced her not to
do much cause we were Officially better friends
only(all laugh)... anyhow Crook(all laugh)...you
couldn't come that day,but when we returned what did you OBSERVE (all burst into laughter)?"
Brock(laugh) : "married couple retuns with other's arms
around (all laugh)/the whole night was thus
travelled being abound(all laugh)/scoffs at me
they're just friends very sound(all burst into
laughter)/finishes the dance midnight feeding me
to the hound(all laugh)..the hound was that i had to manage Chu-bro who was told to fondle me whole night cause Ash was BUSY but Chu needed to be alert(all laugh)..and Togepi was told to misbehave(all laugh)..anyway,again stricken boy (all
laugh)...that dance got you through 32(all burst
into laughter)"
Ash(laugh) : "better than that(all burst into
laughter)...we danced for one full hour when we hardly did anything except hugging each other(all laugh) and again don't
know how we didn't confess that day(all
laugh) and it wasn’t the ponytail day but before and not the fisrt hair fondling day and after(all laugh)...then hugged each other AGAIN WITHOUT DANCING for like another
hour(all laugh)...no words were spoken though in those 2
hours(all laugh)... except how better a friend we
were(all laugh) and pokemons of course (all burst
into laughter)...then just before we went back to
sleep,my flower asks,'um..Ash...','yeah?','Ash..um..(all laugh)..have i
been a nice friend to you(all burst into
laughter)..um..like more than..um..best friends(all burst into laughter)?",'Mist,you are like a friend
whoose even more than best friend (all laugh)...
you're a very nice person,great
person,best...um..friend(all burst into laughter)'
anyway,we went to bed around 2(all laugh),then i
was called at 4:30...'Ash,wake up(all
laugh)...Ash...you idiot (all laugh)..' then as we did
all the time blow into the ear(all burst into
laughter)...i wake up saying 'Mist,why are you
awake and i would be too sleepy at noon,i'll go a
bit later today need to
sleep','huh?!?..sleep...sleep..you jerk,unless we
discuss you'll be trouble(all laugh)...what do you
know about Feraligator..(all laughes
uncontrollably)...well(all laugh)..sorry for the exchange(all burst into laughter)...that's something
for sure(all burst into laughter)... Professor any
clue(all burst into laughter)?"
Gary(laugh) : "been shifted to the cunning section (all
uncontrollably laughs)..."
Tracey (laugh) : "yeah,and we already have Muk(all
burst into laughter)...but the brighter days shines better (all laugh)"
Daisy(laugh) : "i went for an inspection 6 days
back, first Crawdaunt tries to misbehave (all
laugh) by fondling my Squirtle to death and telling him that
he was fondling him as well so that he may give
him his pokeball(all burst into laughter) and that he was younger please listen to his advices(all laugh uncontrollably)...but i
didn't see Feraligator (all laugh) and then came
back and then wanted to see Starew and then(all
burst into laughter)....the brat with that size tries
to dance with me(all laugh),then i chide him(all
laugh),this is in the outer area,then at this rejection
(all laugh) he gets  happier (all laugh) and
snatches Dewgong and then asks him if like he could
do anything for him(all laughes uncontrollably)...
Dewgong of course knows the brat pretty well
mouths him off,to which he gets even more happy
(all laugh) and tells a few other present there that
both me and Dewgong wants to battle them one by one (all
laughes)...and you know this is a serious issue(all
laugh) so i try to mitigate them,and recall the
brat,but he comes out all the time and like laughes at me and all(all laugh),finally he runs out of
patience(all laugh) and then i send him back...Ash
really i'm so glad that you weren't unGlaliely stricken that
day after Sinnoh(all laugh)...our gym would've been a real Circus
otherwise(all laugh)...and yes, Crawdaunt is trying
to cajole Muk to get his calws on my poor little
dolls (all laughs)...to them our rooms etc are big
pokeballs(all laugh)...so Crawdaunt is a master in
combinatorics(all laugh)...and Professor said just
supreme intelligence both those two and that
combinatorics test is an once only as well but the
cost for testing is huge(all laugh) well they create and next moment break all sorts of intelligence records all of them a few like these two a bit more and Feraligator
is cunningly sketched (all laughes uncontrollably)...no,Larry
said that if he was a human,he would've been
fondled by any corporates cause his planning is
just amusing cause they can do only so few tricks but
he's doing those for like 16 years or more and everday
its new...and Feraligator plans intuitively (all laugh)
and then Crawdaunt logically proves the
uninsinuability(all burst into laughter)...then the
two goes out to fool around and no Trace said like they actually plan a whole day what they are going to do(all laugh)...Feraligator first showed the others that me and Dewgong rejected him(all laugh) and took this chance to set them upon us(all burst into laughter)...it's just amusing seeing them everyday their playfullness and they can't breed with thier high intelligence and all that and they
have their own types there but just doesn't bother
about anything at all infact Ash,you've done way way more
than enough for the future anyway(all smile),just
that playfullness is so amusing and among all
actually (all smile), except that brat Heracross(all
laugh) whoose goal is to know about everyone's
beaus(all burst into laughter) but Lil,how was the
just born fearow(all burst into laughter)?"
Lillie(laugh) : "i'm so happy that fearow didn't stay
with Muk more than half an hour cause if the
fearow was mingled with for the full day,she
would've got the whole Pokemon world into grave
danger(all laugh)...no their psychic abilities are
what makes them legends and if that is Muked
with(all laugh),then you can understand what
they'll become (all laugh)...Ash,Mist only
sweetened the Telplocus,and yes Golduck was
there(all laugh),he's been kept sane desperately(all laugh) anyway,if you were there,was there a
chance that our gym and lab never again needed
to work(all laugh)?"
Ash(laugh) : "well actually it’s not my question is it(all burst into laughter)..no,i met the greatest boss
impersonally (all laugh) just asked him about
Telplocus and the highest boss says that yes
Telplocus is extremely hard to manage which my
flower sweetly did(all . and smile) but said that
they were more intelligent than Arceus that he
managed according to his views and he actually
regrets now that he had Mewtwo of all and only
used the psychic dynamo for bad purposes and it
would've been a phenomena if Mewtwo had been
there on that final battle day cause he says
Metwtwo would've realized by the end what
Crawdauntogator was doing and actually would've
tried her best to come with me cause that was
something that she didn't know and her nature being ever free she would’ve been all over me and so that joy
was very enticing and all so according to the
highest boss the thing is that at the end of the day
no matter how playful all becomes they'll battle if their master wants them to and the master will
want them to if he wants to make a living and he'll
deilfinitely do so cause it's just like natural
oil,unless one uses it he's being foolish so he said
that my bunch is a fluke cause somehow they've
caught this mood that their master is not at all
serious about anything and thus they're only with
me cause they themselves think that the master is
a pokemon(all smile)...yeah the soulmate stuff(all
smile) and said that my condition wouldn't have
arrived had i not been born like this and thus
opined that the whole thing is indeed a fluke in
history.but he also said,actually the idea to realize
that Pokemons are just a sport like football or that
if this idea isn't firmly ingrained lenegdaries can
never be tamed cause to him legendaries are so
intelligent that their premise to come with you
must be oiled everyday otherwise they'll believe
they're being bounded and would start troubles
exactly what happened with Arceus,Arceus
according to the greatest boss wasn't intelligent at all,half grown brat(all laugh)...so he charged at
Mewtwo all times cause to him except the
greatest boss and a few others all were enemies
and Metwtwo was taken aback but the highest
boss said he made the mistake of taking Mewtwo
for granted cause she was 6 long years with him
and was very well tamed but of course that was
done illegally but still to legendaries illegality also is a subtle stuff,but anyway so Mewtwo somehow
caught the mood of the highest boss and thus
became ferocious cause to her she was being
abused thus the two legends were incessantly at
each others throats and then the greatest boss
had to terminate them both cause the boss says
his cruelty or like that had to be olied in Mewtwo
so that she stays in that mood but as Arceus
came in and all,that same cruelty now Mewtwo
felt she was being now subjected thus revolted,so to the highest boss
having two legends was his downfall that on that
fatefull day he didn't have either but again said
that no they actually would've turned on him understanding my bunch if they could that is and all exactly what my
beloved half grown fearow(all laugh) could've had
he been with the greatest boss cause the brat that
had fearow was a true brat(all laugh) so barely
had any brain except abusing and thus not one
idea about the master was ingrained in his own
way to the fearow and that's exactly why the great
boss is the greatest cause first he’s the only man alive and known in the last 200 years or so history to manage two legendaries together at the same time despite their infighting so he has something about him and he could imbibe cruelty
and keep it same for so many years and actually
that being honest with himself that he was
cruel(all smile)...that stuff is why he was so jovial
once that self imbibed idea broke down and all but
then my beloved Unovan friends were trying to
better him and thus the mass havoc with 103
legendaries throughtout whole region turning up everywhere and were sweelen up to absolute hell and what not,then there were the 4 bufoons,total lunatic
and trigger happy,103 battlers and support crew all
psychic or grass set ups a few fires and all...those
brats all they knew was to just go and bust and all
my poor Goodra was trying to do was to get their lunacy away so that the legends calm down cause those 4 were like wakes up and tries to kill the first person they see so all were lunatics thus my buddies had to calm them down a bit and Goodra managed the legends but was trying to affect the brat managing it a bit as i said and the brat didn’t understand why his legends was confused so went to full infatuation overdrive and 2 other comrads,his lackey human legends and legends and unlegended pokelegends and all just lost is completely and i jumped to save Goodra and also my own mind was affected and all then the accident happened just my body couldn’t absobe all their insanity cause i also was so connected with Goodra and just a total mess and you know my mental condition in general then...firstly i don’t know know why i left despite all and lastly i don’t know how Bayleaf managed to get the last brat off and then get out of there alive and all my buddies are fine even Charizard and it to me still is just funny because i got 7 days whether before with that perfect setup having defactore from team rocket it self and that too James of all people who knows me and viseversa for all those years and i got 21 days with all supports imaginable and i had no personal responsibility and this time those brats at Unova Elite4 were at total loss having lost both their heads and i just literally jumped into the fire with no preparation by every means what so ever,then i wake up,don’t know how came to hospital might be Nivy not sure also how can all 103 know which is a pokemon centre so perfectly,and they first thought i wasn’t alive cause i was in coma for 6 days with no one fully knowing my identity as hero or villian in those islands and somehow they later realized that it might not be and some of my heads came to know and all but on the 8th day they take Goodra out which they said were difficult cause Goodra himself was at complete bay for the first 3 days but then on 4th he became ferocius and wanted to see me which they did and he instantly realized i was still alive at least and didn’t do anything,it was that final ultimatum mode of Goodra then later i call him he doesn’t do anything at all but tries to again destroy everything much later i realized that he had the thing under control but i rather jumped too early to save him and to him it was the all the human opponents fault cause he had to take care of the legends and couldn’t take care of the human brats physically so to him i was in danger cause those brats and so any human came to me was his enemy anyhow i calm him down and all..Nivy was there with Goodra and he only managed him to calm down and Nivy was much calm throughout the 7 months and i realized when he came to me and was trying to fondle me to hell which i somehow resisted to him it was that he had got everyone off but he just thought he already lost me and that’s why he made others to calm down after we managed to get off the spot..(laugh)..always had a dream of managing all 107 at the same time while being away from almost all and they did exactly that..all my buddies were injured to hell and all were scattered throughout the whole landmass of Unova and all..just their intelligence and playfullness alone got them regrouped and come back to us...but i still was a villian,then finally(laugh)...they saw Goodra and realized i wasn’t the villian cause Goodra was just ferocious that day and yet with other pokemons he behaved well just told them he can’t trust thier masteres that they won’t harm me themselves which was later sorted out..and then of course Persy comes in around 15 days later(laugh) and all that..but i just wished Lance was there cause he would never have jumped into fire like Persy and Trevor did..Trevor just thought that i could manage and himself was sorry that he never knew that no preparation was done in Unova at all before he thought i was sabotaging him and Persy being so young and basically totally unsuited for this administration was at complete bay cause Kalos didn’t bother as their method is see legend terminate legend if misbehaves every hall of fame gym had it which i visited both times and you know what will happen if the equal money and power sharing go away and the current great bunch of gym leaders are sabotaged and it will happen next week anyways,Kalos had their own issues,not a single region was sane including Sinnoh who had ardently followed our beautiful Kanto legends and Hoenn later tried their hands at it too and Johto never knows which side to sail to and Orange was doing all those there and i can’t believe Trevor wouldn’t say a thing trying to resist the great Orange perfectly knowing about Mist then my relations with her and what she was going through and then knowing what moment my sis was in didn’t resist that as well cause he of all people started to believe that i might’ve done something wrong indeed cause i got all that fame after undercover...just totally flustered and lost his head,not one Elite4 head kept their head then and that’s exactly why Lance was needed cause he alone could’ve got this mess through in the very beginning letting the Kalos hall of fame loose first on Unova so that all the gyms get together to create the first resistance knowing Kalos’s termination system which Persy thought can’t be disclosed to minutely...i really was laughing that how can they make mistakes after mistakes for 12 months and not pay any heed to anyone depite Professor Kukui constantly telling Trevor that legends can’t be tamed unless you can create a strong attacking system and support Ash Ketchum’s bunch so that they don’t have to be distracted to protect everything as well just like in team rocket’s time when our well being was more on us than our bunch and not try to defend all time against legends cause you can’t and that’s exactly what my flower’s bunch realized due to Goldy’s heightened powers and his connection with Mist,who was threatened for one moment and thought of the ultimatum despite telling others to defend but that mood Goldy picked up and Starmie and Poliwrath was told and thus Chu was called in on 2-1 vote(laugh) with type advantage and took about 5 minutes to get rid of the grave danger.but then above all the greatest,way higher in immortality what to speak of any kind of pokemons or mere mortals is obviously our very own beloved Kanto who has surpassed all expectations in power hunger,greed and most dangerously omniscience so that a man like Lance was forced to step down because he didn’t battle me properly and like let me go easily and defamed the hall of fame cause he was the strongest Elite4 and rather reciprocated my playfull style thus some authorities despite my swearing were saying now that none knew where i was you have to step down just after 4 months since our battle and Simon was defamed cause he supported Lance through and through and they got the Kanto Coference Congress totally too much involved which has many true once only jewels themselves as Drew told me later,and Lance knew about unovan trouble but definitely not what it actually was and he didn’t want me to get involved at all but all else forced him to oblidge though he did tell me to be cautious of even the heads no matter what and he regretted than he can’t help at all cause the knife was at his throat and if he budges now Kanto withing months would create fearow bunch and destroy everything legally itself and then the Kanto said this guy does too many undercovers and gets the leeway,something is wrong definitely so lets start infighting over him and get rid of Lance..this also was a fluke in history that the whole pokemon world came at blows at the same time and truely Trevor should’ve been wise enough having seen it first hand 3/4 years back i just was the go to man then i was the suspect villian and Percy never realized anything about the seriousness,45 now,we all know him,one of my favourites as well,he is ranked just belowe me all 8 league victories and all 7 Elite4 wins,only person except me to beat Lance in the last 15 years,once ever talent but administration is Kanto business..then Katy was there who is 80 now she is actually better than these but is now out of professional world for 10 years and can’t battle legally and you know 72 is last after that there’s no chance of it cause none wants it after 60 continuous(laugh),she knew me but she was ever enthusiastic in such things cause herself did a few in her heydays and Laure vs Katy is legendary as you know..anyway,Percy tells me the Telplocus story(laugh)...that Chu bro threatened a whole 16 strong Telplocus brigade to such degree that Orange Elite4 had to admit that they can’t do much about my sweetie’s actions either after getting the news...still tried to test him(laugh)..and Mist told me later that if there were 160 Telplocus’ still Chu would’ve been able to threaten them cause for such a tiny pokemon in an island sourrounded by ocean and threatens legendary water electric types before his own friends having Golduck with all his powers and his face was like he was laughing that why 16 bring me 600 and those overzealous Telplocus’ who tried those psychic stunts got totally decimated cause my bunch is fully immune and realizes too well about dark-psychic attacks unless for their own bunch who only can get under the skin of the others cause it’s all fun and then that final thunder-chair demo was shown and the brats just happily accepted the poor Telplocus who never knew what to do in the full 35 minute stand,and then the 17 went away without one more word...Chu told my flower’s bunch to just get him if attacking is needed cause he is the distinct type advantage and they knew his powers by then and Starmie did exactly that cause she fully realize as Goldy asserted that Mist feels physically threatened and wants the ultimatum mood no matter her commands and they weren’t being able to defend at all against 16 legends though Golduck was still trying to not get Chu involved cause he wasn’t sure whether Chu was pshychic immune or not cause of his temperament and that too against 16 brats who got Godly and rest totally cornerd with psychic attacks only for my sweetie’s sweetness to send the signal constantly that she doesn’t mean any harm at all..but Chu’s discipline was amusing that didn’t do a single thing in all those that happened no matter what till he was called as Mist never told him to,while Mist was physically threatened he i guess if not exactly still did understand the seriousness still didn’t get involved cause his original master was someone else who told him that he won’t see him again and nothing else and thus waited for Mist’s bunch to ask him and he would’ve only come out if he sensed the psychic attacks were now affecting Mist and him and Mist was really vulnerable,he would just have busted and truely could’ve electrulate the whole sea there killing all that brigade with others and dying himself in the process cause his second master now too was about to go in front of him,just infinite numbers of thunder-chairs and self heal in no time to destroy anything in opposition,none can stop him in that mood except my leader Bulbasaur and Mime and Gengleye and no not even me cause these 4 to him are more trusted than me myself(laugh,shakes head) in emotional situations according to his interpretation cause Bulbasaur is leader,Gengleye are themselves masters in dark arts and are with me always and both by nature most jovial so they can pick up my real mental signal anytime and Mime is cause she stays with mom and has a similar responsibility...but that disciple was amusing even went into pokeball and just at right moments came out to threaten human brats in offices who tried to misbehave and once they saw him they realized it’s not good to mingle too much with this lenegdaty lunatic dynamo..if it was me in my flower’s place,Chu would’ve done the exact opposite..anyway,i later got the beautiful men of all gorgeous men via phone which was an experience itself cause of what Chu did(laugh)..first,they asked about my health and my bunch and all then infact cautioned me to never get involved no matter what unless my own home was threatened cause to them the legends has increased the frequency cause they want to make permanent homes and can’t find the way on how to balance it with humans,which is a big topic recently as we know and thus said certain people are ever too ready to be too greedy so i better be ever unready else they’ll drag me each week of the year through the whole world and even told me not to not keep any realtions with any Elite4 heads except Kanto due to obligations cause they temselves aren’t sure whoose bossing them anymore and regretted that Lance had to step down like that and i spoke about Persy to them to which they say yes Persy is good but they are not sure whether he can keep his nerves like Lance ever did if his own office is infighting or irresponsible for 10 years just like what Kalos exactly is for 50 the riches are the shackle but anyway they told that Orange Elite4 was alright now cause the head was removed and all,they weren’t much harmed as usual ccause they never mingled and slyly changed designations at the very first spotting of Telplocus as their boss were trying to get too interested and thus they realized they better flee the scene as had a premonition of doom to they shifted into the Conference based system via their fiancee’s status and said were saved due to that cause they were in grave danger cause the previous designation was right inside the trouble then they rather calmly told that they were really taken aback suddenly seeing Misty of all people cause they never expected why she would go to them due to their designations and her requirements were different then when they saw Chu realized the deal and the seriousness of the situation as Chu as he picked up the uneasiness of my flower,straight came out of pokeball just in time to calmly sit down beside Mist(laugh) while sparking infrequently in the smallest possible amount with as usual that sweet adorable face to just give you the hint that he’s ready all the time but is too playfull too and how he behaves is upto how he and his group including humans is treated,cause he just realized that it’s human matter that he didn’t understand but he was ready for one breach of line to thunder-chair anyone as i told him minutely the half foot circle in case of uneasiness in me myself so many times during my Elite4 journies,recalled that perfectly and then matched it up with Mist having the idea that we were always together and it goes back to the beginning as well so it may mean the same thing...what an intelligence to guess even the second master all because she was his main masters solmate thus similar relation to them themselves however they interprets it and Chu interprets it,soulmates indeed(smile,all smile)...(hugs Misty very firmly and forcefully closes her eyes,Misty hugs Ash very firmly as well smiling with tears)...and that’s exactly why he is who he is...(all smile)..anyhow they tell me that seeing Chu they realized that its not anything else but the current matter as they knew the moods of water empress in certain issues very well and that of my dissappearences and what was going on around me in the media but they said Chu signalled that it’s just about his current master,so they said that yes we did what we were asked to later we came to know that she agreed jump into the fire on rather being compelled to and be all alone almost in nowhere against incensed legendaries anyway,then they just said the trouble was cause the head just lost her mind with all those legends in greed and wanted to feign via Mist to get the Telplocus herself which she failed in as Brock intervened just in the right time with Mr Maple as he was told to and that was the only reason why no more bigger fiasco was created for their own benefit casuse Chu truely would’ve killed their bunch off along with themselves thus setting that brigade on the Orange Elite4 cause they would’ve realized the true villians and would’ve gone nuts about it and then i was just the Ocean and a much of a landmass away(laugh) with 103 poor pokemons and 4 great buffoons but then the beautiful men just solemnly added that this won’t be the end this particular situation of the whole Elite4 systems to come into blows will again happen later if not sooner and if not to such a degree to which i had to concur and then just asked how they themselves were with the positions no matter the designations to which they said they’ll remain safe cause of their skills and success and that’s the whole trouble is all about cause the more that is the more leeway you get in Elite4 without proper testing in highest levels,which again i had to concur then i asked about Chu’s testing to which they said it was a disgrace on their whole Elite4 indeed and they had the first hand experience of a battle themselves so said despite knowing all my bunch might’ve tried to snatch Chu away which was thwarted by all sane people at Orange and also given Oak Lab by then was all behind me and Persy finally realizing that my bunch could be abused and thus compelling them to self destroy thus was up in arms with every Elite4 head cause his own Electrolite was abused at a test centre in his 3rd journey at Kanto of all places though that was just a mistake but Kanto you never really know...and then much later Persy said they grabbed Chu tested at the best test facility,(laugh)...the brats want to start from thunderbolt,gets thunder-chair to a high degree,all were barely alive and Chu-went upto a guy and as he does bit his nose(laugh)..he realized what idiots they were(laugh)..so they realize that if you keep Chu away from my flower may be 10000 km,you can’t quite stop the thunder chair to not help my sweetie if she just mentally wanted it at all and then those idiots silently fled the scene hadning Chu over to Tracey...those 12 months has been real fiasco as after everything all tries to go after me in legal battles dragging my first undercover teammate and his whole family now that they realized that i was in type disadvantage again and Knato of all leads them(laugh)..but i’m only happy that first no pokemons were killed including my bunch mosty because of grass/psychic and the fire gyms we were too lucky but these 4 buffoons did only this right thing by not getting 103 pure-fire legends cause then dad had to return on an emergency call(lugh)...but the next group of buffoons to pop up next month will do exactly that the first thing and we know where most fire gyms exists so my home may be threatened...anywaay,all the legends has been taken care of and let go of that’s the greatest thing and that other human brats out of that group alive are with the greatest boss to atleast learn to be proper criminals and not buffoons..and i’m very happy that only those 4 utter buffoons including a few of their ardent disciples are being treated at hell or heaven so that they become a bit saner next time they return to try their hands at crime(laugh)...finally and lastly the greatest boss comes to know all and receive all the surviving brats under his wing very gladly and told them that if he could get 103 legends he would’ve quitted cause he atleast strived for the illusive that he will understand all about the legends and make all else hostages and not just do what the buffoons were upto cause they would’ve destroyed all of their own things and they got that in front of them in a plate cause of the legend trouble and Unova Elite4 totally fell apart..utter idiots creats a fiasco like that for 27 months...anyway,whatever,Crawdanut was with me with Goodra and even when almost dead the brat tried to spoil other pokemons at the centre and Feraligator actually invaded the pokemon centre demanding he and his friends be treated otherwise even in that condition he tried to dance upon anything(laugh)...the moment the danger got over all were so happy again..some bunch i have and they proved why they are 107 legends together absolutely once ever...(all smile and .)..i send Bulbasaur back after 3 and half or 4 months via proxy through Kukui lab which was my last contact with sanity and tell him to get a second battelion ready and all so that they may come later to me if needed,Bulbasaur doesn’t want to come that Chu wasn’t with me but Infernape tells him that if they return then who will look after them and the others which Bulbasaur realized and budged and Muk to was sent back with him though he being the only one to face a legend was important but he’s just too dear to me as has a lots of type disadvantages and Professor Oak and all and he is a very rare breed which Kanto desperately wants to delete so sent him back,(laugh)who forced the alarm Gary..?
Gary(smile) : “Bulbasaur...was ferocious after a certain point i guess they are extremely well tuned as well somehow...later told you that when he returned he just asked GuzzLord who specified a limit and then Bulbasaur was angry after that was crossed and i guess it’s about his own judgement of each one’s strenght and temperamnet and he saw those legendaries and those 4 brats and all probably gauged something and almost killed me because i wasn’t listing to him and as you told him created the second battelion with Muk as deputy recuited the other groups yet Mime was kept far away,Chu didn’t know a thing when he was here and then Chu wasn’t himself bothered about any of his buddies and finally Ash of all people and actually threatened Misty to not mingle him with any of his buddies after she returned which is miraculus really as we always say follow the command not the general,this is exactly that which all 107 did even including Mime.Bulbasaur was all at it and Muk was ever with him and was extremely scary himself which we all thought was because grandpa couldn’t be with him all time who only realized this second battelion stuff later,really it was scary we called emergencies cause Bulbasaur won’t say a word and become ferocious and a lot others weren’t happy either and all but then Bulbasaur suddenly invaded our home of all places which Muk got him in and i don’t know how and straight tried to attack grandpa only to be dissuaded by Muk then grandpa told me its about the second battleion and he is asking us to send them to you and they have a full battelion ready cause something might’ve happened to you and Bulbasaur after returning sensed it and grandpa unfortunately was bed ridden at that time and thus Bulbasaur couldn’t get to him and he was instructed to ask him only then leave if he permits and truely none in the world except my grandpa would realize instantly about the second battelion and would tolerate Muk for all these years only cause Muk ever was so fond of him and Muk’s nature was like that.Bulbasaur never even told me that he wants to see grandpa nor Muk cause you told them to directly meet him and never involve us cause he knew the second battelion would’ve been ferocious and would only budge to grandpa and we may not be able to interpret it cause it was secret and may be you and your bunch could do it ever to such a degree but Ash’s biggest ever fear is that his wife and his brothers would lose their heads in such cases and which certaily we now realize has more than enough validity to believe in cause we saw first hand what happened and we were about to lose our heads as well only for grandpa again to councel us..Gradpa said second battelion was ever done with maximum 8/9 outsiders if the trainer was too extremely good and we had about 8 times more..anyway,i think we were just about a 8 days late...then grandpa tells me after about 3/4 minutes with Muk and Bulbasaur constantly kept saying just that ‘Master wants us’ and even then won’t directly say more and Bulbasaur was constantly vine-whipping Muk who was making faces and like that to say that it was a very serious issue and just hint the second battelion and more brutally as you told them to empty the lab again and again,they themselves were trying to get the third ready too to use cause you know a quite a few are extremely fond of some of your bunch and they try fondle you like their own master so those probably was tried as well as Mime suddenly wanted to get involved dragging aunt here after we started our own procedure and was always talking with a few here and doing her psychic tricks upon them to agitate them and they were at Tracey’s ears whole time to try to get him to use them and our pokemons themselves became volcanic whenever we called them out,our bunch always told us they are all ready for a real fight,Brock had to do it once in Orange and Mudkip was too dangerous...grandpa said Ash’s ever constant playfull threat of emptying the lab is exactly this they won’t let us live here unless you atleast try to find Ash with them,then i contancted Trevor who doesn’t a thing except you were in grave danger and yet suspects that your motives weren’t saintly and none knew where you were then we had to wait for a week to even get to know what actually was there,then we go to Orange and Unova respectively and then came to know what happened and then that Telplocus stuff of all-they get Misty involved even in that situation and throw her in similar stuff if not worse only cause she was the best with water pokemons and most heinous thing was that they were playing games with her using you as they do and then she can’t contact us and gets virtually stranded in nowhere and all that and then finally that legal drama which really got upto our nerves-i just wish you don’t go anywehere away from us in this life again Ash except the 3 city circle and even i’d say not much in Viridian and if urgent then only Pettlesberg and Pettlesberg won’t call you ever now even in most urgency that we know.Lance not being there anymore i don’t trust the Elite4 either no matter how good they have been to us cause these idiots should understand that you have your life and not drag you anywhere just because you’ll help and the worst thing was they were absolutely at bay with everything and tried to fetch those brats with 103 legends and no you shouldn’t be involved with Viridian gym either in case there’s a hint of undercover stuff cause we don’t trust anyone anymore unless it’s in our family or extended ones...and also next time a fearow comes i’ll empty the whole lab on the brat so that atleast you and Misty can show how to manage legends..all the bunch recovered well and Chu was so happy to return to Misty...and his temperament has got a bit better bit more playfull and no those 16 Telplocus’ brigade would remember what exactly is type disadvante for years...and then(laugh)..as you said the brats wanted still to test him of all(Ash laughs)..Tracey said Chu just came out as if he was expecting a mountain and got a peeble and then that legal drama(Ash and Gary laugh others smile)...absolutely the authorities got what they deserved for sure..and Misty had Chu more than you ever had in all situations even in pokeball..and then the great Kanto wouldn’t let the gym get shut and was trying to get the frontier symbol back again but Mrs Slate and Kane managed that beautifully always keeping it open just for 4 days and going real full steam at anyone with Dewgong in charge citing their incompetence if they pestered around and then going off for a week citing pokemon exhaustion and complaining abuse and challenger quality and behaviour 3 times did it they realized the game got off us and the great Kanto Conference Congress was decimated by Drew as usual with his tactics and calmness,those brats were saying that you also corrupted that stuff with your ribbon and all,didn’t get upto May then though cause of her maternal leave and different region which their beloved Hoenn students suddenly out of their slumber did and obviously Mr Maple was there with all his Hall of Fame powers which was very crucial for us otherwise we would’ve never been allowed to even reach you but he too was almost all alone cause of the accusions that he was the reason why you won Hoenn(Ash laugh) and then linking your sis of all(Ash laugh and shakes his head) but the whole family did shield it from May beautifully via Max who just kept her distracted via her maternal leave privacy itself,later you know Max got all those pokemons whom he personally knew together and Mia too was ever beside him,real family Ash,sure(all smile)...but i saw aunt as well once she picked up Mime’s notes,told her she’s free to leave her and go to the lab if you have told her so after 4 times she dragged aunt to the lab forcefully and she’ll be ok which Mime didn’t do cause that was her instruction and then later aunt told grandpa that she knows all about Mime so (laugh) even she said that if needed she can atleast tell Mime to just battle and Mime will do it all by herself(Ash laughs and shakes his head) so if Misty needed her she could go(Ash laughs)...really Ash,you were here for 15 days or so ever doing all those and each word came true including your final ultimatum that probably way surpassed your expectations...”
Ash(laugh) : “yeah i guess but the biggest mistake they did was to involve my wife in it first and then my sis in her maternal leave...i don’t understand what they think of people that you can drag ladies in their most important phases of life and just run them around because they are great professionals or are successfull this is why i just can’t forgive Trevor of all ever no matter what he did during undercover how great he was to me...the whole Sinnoh group was doing your empowerment process and i was so assured but then calles them back after his suspicion over over me and then only for Professor Kukui,Birch and Naomi to prevent that thing from happening and then of course legends were after the Oak Lab now that Professor was unwell and bed-ridden and then drags the whole family in..i never knew Unova was such a big issue otherwise i would’ve made sure that Lance knows it full well and let me into the Knato Elite4 and take charge of the Undercover properly planning with Lance and the simplest solution was to get the greatest boss involved with researchers and according to him set up the tame-legend plan cause non else knows more about them on hand and then force all Elite4s to use it-nothing would’ve happened then..cause i would’ve got Johto giants involved too where most fearows are found and created a group with atleast  5 and let them loose with my bunch as leaders and see what can any human or pokebrat do about it..Johto remained static as Knato wasn’t doing anything so they won’t either and Johto didn’t get involved only because i didn’t win that league and never were harsh to them to my utmost misfortune,otherwise i truely had to get a herd of fearows and set them upon Johto itself to create another Unova but to fondle any gym to death...but (laugh) mom getting involved is the biggest thing totally unimaginable for me,i ask her what was that and said no Mime picked up your mood and i just thought i should go too that both of you were out..then i had to tell her everything i knew about dad,i and Mist were doing in absolute minute details and she rebukes me and all that...that was what i never expected(laugh)..3rd battelion well i thought i must myself had to be here but Bulbasaur,Muk and even Mime managed it amusingly just picking up my rage when i said empty the whole lab may be 10 times rather unknowingly in that mental state just before leaving as i realized i’ve made a mistake and don’t have any means to rectify it or be able to tell Mist even despite knowing it cause i just had passed the point of no return cause i had to be with my bunch then without any compromise.when i sent back Bulbasaur and Muk i only told them again the 2nd battelion throughly and nothing else cause i wasn’t emotionally disturbed anymore but they of course saw the sweet buffoons and lunatic legends and knew what we were up against,Muk never wanted to return i forcefully told him Bulbasaur will be fried to ashes if the whole fire group misbehaves during the creation because of my Quilava agitatig them too much beforehand to come with me and now Bulbasaur doesn’t want some certain ones cause they know very well that fire types are hard to tackle if too agitated and i or Infernape never had enough time to calm them down so Muk must be there..fire types as ever are my biggest concern due to their moods and we have the most insane ones among them as Magmorter(laugh,Gary shakes his head)..so anyhow that was done and then(laugh)..it was the fires most recuited in second battelion due to my rage they thought they had to be real destructive and got the fires most who followed suit already by being agitated then later knowing the reason...whole 15 Magmorters,who were abused before would’ve created a mayhem there in grass and fire gyms once they knew their new found life was in danger which was Bulbasaur’s trick knowing that it was grass gyms..my few colleagues there was good but it was just too hard for them to comprehend and i let 8 groups with 10 memebrs and let them go and kept the rest 11 with me,they did it almost all by themselvs and only my colleagues knew and supported me later cause they saw what my bunch did first hand and how they saved them all the time..(laugh)...had a dream of managing 107 at the same time scattered all over againt greatest legends certainly came to fruitation with 103 mostly unknown legends there...and another dream to face and tame lenegnds well face i did just too many times against too many and don’t want to anymore of that and tame my soulmate did(all smile)...too much mastery for too many lives(all smile)...that 3rd battelinon is which truely does surpass my expectation by miles for sure and i guess your own bunches would’ve created with Mime’s help the 4th and 5th truely emptying themselves on the whole world to find me and my bunch and hunt down any hindrence even humans-that was a real scare indeed which i still feel is there i’ll need more time with them to calm them down especially that Magmorter groups sub-leader,leader and rest very happy but that brat still is ever unhappy that he wasn’t needed in full force for which he was dying really(laugh).Chu would do that i knew but mom to get agitated is absolutely unbelieveable too me...took dad’s final details very calmly and finally told me never to leave as i didn’t need to from any prospects and that’s all..i only wish they don’t electruculate the whole sea...total m.. creats these situations and gets destroyed exactly there..you still don’t know behind the scenes stuff well..got upto the gratest boss of all that if he can say i of all was an actually opposite gang(laugh,Gary and Brock laughs and shakes their head)...told them some names and asked them if they knew these and how to use these on a darknend-Mewtwo to abuse her while she is battling then told them they may be haven’t seen one except in a picture dictionary(both and Brock laugh) what to speak of abusing and that to which will only affect during certain moments and moves in a battle with certain types(all laugh) and then just told them that before accusing someone they should stay with him in confinement cause quote ‘the unconfined world seems to lack even the most common sense these days’(all laugh) and that’s exactly why that man should’ve been involved in this system and then they got to those 3 asking of my deeds during undercover as you know all people were pulling stunts on me and Trevor didn’t know or wanted to stop them cause of their positions and all so get to those 3 and they just said as they’re so interested on how people live in underworld business they can take Mewoth at their home and get the demo(all laugh)..so they got totally flattened in this two places that biggest enemies were praising me...and you know their final plan was to check of all the Crawdauntogator(all laugh)...the infinite compassion saved them there but i’ll still send them again to Kukui lab if needed cause still one or two people are at my ears and they’ll get the fun for life there...Brock how was Cili?”
Brock(laugh) : “more ardent fan of yours(all laugh)...Unovan Wisdom finally dawns upon him that indeed then ‘mam was right after all(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “so we’re competiting now(all burst into laughter)...anyway Professor,as i was saying,so my sweet flower says
"hmm..what do you know of Waterflower(all laugh)..
(whisper,”Mist!Mist!your tears so sweetie!”,hugs Misty firmly and then again tenders her head,Misty smiles while hugging Ash firmly all the time)
sorry was tendering my petals(all laugh)...so she goes about how water Pokmeons should be used and all,then i say,’Mist,i’ll be too tired tomorrow’,’why i’ll see that you get a good sleep at noon,get up’...so noon comes and all were mouthed off(all laugh) and then gently puts me to sleep and then Crook,what was the narration?”
Brock(laugh) : “i think we need more of your dating experiences”
Ash(laugh) : “great,this on from dance party again Kalos that brat was trying to dance with me,got her friend(all laugh)...”um..Ash,this”..”’mam,i’ve got a speciality that you may not know/i can do many move but you must bend like perfect bow(all laugh)/but then that’s exactly where comes my glee/cause when you’ll straightened up by then i’ll flee(all bursts into laughter)...i said look,i do non-body contact 2 foot circle dance(all laugh),while talking about half grown fearows(all laugh)...so just went in the hall half a minute come back,done(all laugh)...Crook(all laugh)”
Brock(laugh) : “Brock,um..did you see Ash..”,’sleeping looks extremely cute’(all burst into laughter),’um..no always so,als..anyway(all laugh)..then talks for few minutes about how grass types are bad except Ash’s bunch(all laugh)..Brock,um..he might’ve woken up..um..shouldn’t you keep an eye on him whether he’s properly sleeping(all burst into laughter) or not..i mean sleeping at all or daydreaming(all laugh)...you know my dre(all laugh)...um..bad dreams(all burst into laughter)..”,’Misty,i’ve known you two for 5 long years,why don’t you guys just confess and start a relationship ?..it’s ridiculus this childish behaviour of deferring(all laugh)..’..sobbs now(all laugh)..’but..but..he doesn’t like me..(all burst into laughter)..he didn’t let me say i cherish him,he didn’t hug me yesterday properly(all laugh)...he..he doesn’t take me to parties cause he thinks he’ll be ashamed..he..that..(all laugh)..”,then i just say that why don’t you take rest as well(all laugh)...’huh?!?you support him then(all burst into laughter)..support him behind my back..(sob)..you...I HATE YOU TWO(all burst into laughter)...i’ll show you Brock,you...you want me to be away from my..my..(sob)..(all laugh)..’,’Misty wake him up after an hour and half i’m going to sleep(all burst into laughter),’um..alright i’ll look after my..my..um..friend Ash then(all laugh)..best friend..so..(all laugh)..um..you get out and NONE SHOULD BE AROUND MY...um..just GET OUT(all burst into laughter) thus back to the fearow(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “yeah then the most daysed person in the world calls whoose a devil as Daisyl(all laughs uncontrollably)”
Daisy(laugh) : “too eloquent i see(all laugh)...Mist,we’re out for a tour,come back or the Gym will shut for 6 months..bye’(all burst into laughter)...we didn’t call her back the next day neither did she call(all laugh)...Sarah tells us..”um..Daisy,a boy..(all burst into laughter)’...’yeah,Ash Ketchum,Pokemon Master(all laugh),Pallet,Orange Champion,5 years travel just infatuation(all laugh uncontrollably)...don’t let the brat in(all laugh)...but i’ll ever remember how he threatened anyone that hindered his way in the gym,calls everyone sir or ‘mam,next moment becomes Dase,don’t try me(all laugh)..Sarah ever hindered him and Brauch..’um....but i just want to meet Mist..’,’Misty and no(all laugh) we can’t allow you in’,’hey namecalls(both laugh)..just ask those 3 namecalls where the namecalls are(all laugh)..i’ll show namecall them what is namecalled battling..(all laugh)...’ so they ever flew off to all hells..and the little brat knew exactly what he was doing,always kept his insane bro in reservation area(all burst into laughter)..and knew every inch of the gym as if his very own place(all laugh)..and tried to mingle with Victor(all burst into laughter)..some dense pest that was(all burst into laughter)..and this all were during Battle Frontier when we forced him to stay at visitors room(all laugh) and had fun for 11 days then the pest was angy and before we left the next day he set Marshadow,Banette and Sableye upon us(all laugh) who scared Viol to death(all laugh) but to he this meant greatest husband protecting his wife(all laugh) so the whole world had to budge(all laugh) in Sinnoh was totally different patted us himself to stay healthy(all laugh) and all sorts of things that were irritating(all laugh) but we realized that he was a caring person very much but to me still was ego(all laugh) and Viol was swinging each moment cause she was contacted 1000 times on Mantine(all laugh) and Lil couldn’t get over the Trophy(all laugh) that was fun..no Ash,for all,if you did regular the gym then,we would’ve had a serious problem cause your mad bro would’ve got too starved and attacked anyone(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “well i ever thought why only water gym why not water-DARK(all laugh) and the trophy was just my toffee-flower(all laugh)...right(all burst into laughter and .),but Daisy you should’ve kept Seismitoad atleast(all laugh)..Glalie was used may be twice cause of damn rules(all laugh) and may be 5th time turned on the whole gym as sustandard(all laugh) but,finally Professor,after too many melodies and too little fearows,sum up the 3rd stage of evolution.(all laugh).”
Gary(laugh) : "so the stricken boy and blossomed flower were forced out of teenage(all laugh) by the end of Johto two years year too late(all burst into laughter)...so thus were doing unteenage thinks in public places(all laugh) but now deep nights were better
used(all laugh), without actual Gengars outside of
sweet sweet hearts(all laughs and .s)...so
yeah,to them the marriage was of 20 years and it
was no big deal(all laugh) and so the results..."
Ash(laugh) : "thanks for impersonal help
Professor(all burst into laughter),the next stage is
longing-boy and the once only
Gyarados-flower (all burst into laughter) but sadly
there's a new pest of a rose in the horizon (all
laugh),an unmarried sister brat(all burst into
laughter),this has to be mentioned cause may be by now Drew has fled home(all laugh)...her bike also gets Thunder-chaird,'um..

laugh)...and she as usual only Drew and that's all
and Drew had to directly propose to even
befriend the Torchic(all laugh) don't know how
tiring the final was(all laugh)..proposal to her was the symbol of trust imbibed from cousins(all laugh)...anyway any other
boys if had any interest in her after Drew was
around were it was my or Brock's responsibility to
drive them away in case they misbehave(all
laugh) but she'll play the sweet girl stuff (all laugh)
cause Drew then will be beaten in his own game and that was their game-jealousy(all laugh)..sweet
girl stuff was after preliminary rounds(all
laughs),my and Brock's pokemons and
philosophical knowledge (all laugh) or a huge
lecture on what she expects from a certain
person,which is her mom's knowledge (all bursts
into laughter) and of course her very own
knowledge on gender bias(all burst into
laughter)...that gender bias was her way to get rid
of pests if they crossed the limit and we didn't do
anything about it (all laugh)...it was ferocious stuff
cause used to read actually to get prepared (all
burst into laughter) cause Drew had to get through
that filter and i think that was a more dangerous
filter to my namecalled ones(all laugh)..cause on
very first date it'll be show that your soul is
eternally biased(all laughs)..yeah,this also
included whether Drew can cook like Brock or
not because of bias(all burst into laughter)..really little sis by all
means(all smile)...they were after the Hoenn was
soulmated in both ways and the full side-show frontier(all laugh) was negotiations on proposal
and cost of that(all laugh) and if we retorted
would make a face and like get tearfull that her
brothers were genderly biased(all burst into
laughter) and so on,no wonder Drew had to take
her with him in Johto(all burst into laughter)...but
our sweet crook decides to give this costly meance to
confession rights(all burst into
laughter) her 3 and half year food(all laugh)...and
yeah,she was the only travel companion to whom i
myself mentioned my sweet-bug's name(all laugh)
others were told it was only me and Brock who
travelled together(all laugh),so this sister-pest
hears the name Misty and goes like wow,5 years
how many proposals cost wise(all burst into
laughter), whether you've proposed on mid dawn(all laugh) or
mid afternoon (all laugh) and so on...i tell her look
you're just getting started, concentrate on
Torchic(all laugh),that would become gender bias(all laugh)
especially cause her 'lil sweet bro never liked her
attitude cause she was making deals at his cost(all laugh),this young bro was all over
Brock(Brock laughs) cause he was the
encyclopedia on any legendary pokemons and
then later to my flower cause my flower was the
ideal youngest sibling-flower(all burst into
laughter)...anyhow just to end that this pester-
sister was even more dangerous in after battle
parties where she had to be allowed via her dad's
very high position,which by the way my flower used at Kanto
but i desisted myself cause she was too bug-
tempered then(all laughs)..and Orange battle parties were all about holding each other’s hand(all laugh) and all,but Orange was strangely calm cause i was interested in the history and all,the halls were old and beautiful and all and for my toffee-flower it was water pokemons so those were rather calm and holding the hands too too too firm(all laugh) and we were 18 so onlookers like jackals(all laugh)..didn’t get much chances and jackals never went to parties except the final one cause obviously those patries weren’t held in bushes(all burst into laughter)..the only thing cunningly best(all laugh)..anyhow so this sister-pest went with her big bro whereas the bigger crook wasn’t allowed as he had to babysit littlest bro(all laugh)..sister took the big bro so that sister could enjoy parties that wasn’t allowed before(all laugh) but mostly because dumped semi-grown male brats were always there(all
laugh),so anyway sis would threaten bro that if
any boy was asking her to dance he has to be
Thunder-chaired(all laugh) though she'll herself
talk with all people in the world(laugh) this is a
double-edged ploy to get her jealousy stories
richer and get my sights off other girls(all . and
laugh) and if i don't listen then Cerulian Gym will
be informed from the spot itself(all burst into laughter) with the fact that i was
biased(all laugh) and this was way before when i didn't formally confess(all laugh)...May obviously
knew quite a lot by the time she saw my flower
first and the first thing she says after formalities
'aw...heard so much about you,bro is so fond of
you'(all burst into laughter) then was trying her
hands at proposals(all laugh) which was
somehow managed...but still the biggest trouble
was the Crook(all laugh) cause crook joins us a bit later in
Hoenn and first thing he says 'yeah,Ash,Misty told
to tell you this(all laugh),this is the confirmation of
proposal (all laugh) so 'aww,this is why so much
talk,bro what's her ring size'(all burst into
laughter)...then i say 'give it a rest, she's my friend
only' this statement to the Crook is most heinous
(all laugh) he later goes putting a wise hand on my
shoulder and looking at the sky(all laugh) i still
remember even after 15 long years, 'Ash,all friend earthly, girlfriend
heavenly'(all burst into laughter)... anyway,the
Crook was worst at Sinnoh(Brock laughs)...but
that much later,so crook you may finish cooking"
Brock(laugh) : "right,so this was longing-boy(all laugh),before reunion it was general stuff,'hey
Mist,come here'(all laugh),but since he saw
Gyarados with his flower it was outrageous
stuff(all laugh)..but this is best explained by the
Gyarados-flower"
Misty(laugh) : "right my Cerulian Gyarados(all
laugh) as usual minutely observes me too closely
(all laugh) cause it was 11 months too soon(all
laugh) and he didn't quite get my personality
change(Ash and Misty laugh at each other)...this
is a huge topic but i'll say just a bit later,just the
hint is that why wasn't he informed during Unova
when his phone was turned off perpetually(all
laugh),anyway,so my beau observes me and sees
the responsible(both laugh)..um,sorry but this was
the exact gateway to my hellrounds(all
laugh)...and also why Dase, Cerulian,the whole
world was sweared left and right(all laugh)..so sees
my new self,of course totally becomes a pet (all
laugh) and starts Gyaradosing(all laugh),his
knowledge on Gyarados actually saved Telplocus first cause he told me how to get a good hold on
the Gyarados rage(all laugh) which was simple,quote ‘migle her with Chu-bro and tell her to misbehave and try her hands at infighting(all burst into laughter)’..that’s how Tyrangaleo was tamed first(all laugh) all else jumped upon them in unison as was the case of Metagross(all laugh) but he is way more polite(all laugh) but then the real Tyranitar and Madgaleo came with the happiness instructor(all laugh)..no my Ash did tell me jokingly before leaving and i realized later of course what it was i just laughed at first but when he gave me Chu and was very serious again told me ‘let Chu among your bunch in gym or here Gyarados,Dwegong,Kingdra,Sharpedo,Tentacruel etc needs to calm down and get more jovial realizing that Chu is just too powerfull and the only way to mitigate him is to play around with him giving him the signal that they don’t mean any harm cause by being serious they are making Chu to become even more dangerous cause you might be needed anywhere in the first 1 month only because i’ve told them that you’re my wife cause of the wills and all and send them copies of our marriage registry certificate so if these guys are serious like they are,consider yourself dead after you’ve just agreed to go.”(all smile)..um..do you want to know more about my bee’s final message cause like fearows may come around again and i never shared these and he won’t tell anyone except me these things seriously(smile)..?..”
Gary(smile) : “as ever Misty,we know his bunch too well but not how he himself got here and especially me given i was better than him at a time however long ago and small spanned it was and yes given the situations fearows are dangerous and if not them others that aren’t pokemons are there too waiting patiently and then i myself have 30.”
Daisy(smile) : “always Mist,we remeber the 16 year old Pokemon Master who had 3 pokemons and told us that(Ash laughs and shakes his head) and barring the obvious,what 2 amongst them do now with one not even being the original one(Ash laughs shaking his head) and yeah i guess we’ll need to know cause things aren’t good and we don’t want to hinder his bunch or even Magmorter and Golem cause we don’t understand their actions in normal situations wholly many times as thhey are ever too playfull..”
Misty(smile,hugging Ash very firmly,Ash smiles and tends her head) : “thanks Dase,Gary.i’ve always kept it down as he also wrote it down in excerpts and then recorded it while saying just like that note cause it was too huge..i wrote the full thing down the...(takes a paper,Ash laughs and shakes his head,all smile)
‘Goldy is of your own nature ever playfull and innocent and that’s exactly how he came to you almost by himself.the skills you have are an illusion if you believe you’ve earned them by training.this might be my final long talk Mist,just saying unless () at (),Unova was no more among us i would never have been remotely bothered to leave you and it’s just because of him cause he showed me first to the way to this condition of mine that is now and my bunch and in a way he was my gateway to my soulmate as well..i can’t let him down before he restarts his legendary career as a 16 year old 21 years later.his story comes later in this talk.he you know best general dragon gym 156 highest trained dragons including all, the greatest gym leader in 500 years may be in Unovan history and the similarly glorious man as a person,totally wiped off those 156 and he was psychiced off by 80 most elusive legends whoose masters i’ll be so overjoyed to meet to see what is better greed or joviality,anyway () was sent to hospital nothing could be done as the brats went there with 20 fire legends out of blue in late night  but all these you’ll learn now as you read anyway,i’ll say much today with repeations may by but anyway,lets continue,see Mist it’s a huge story and i won’t may be ever have time to tell you or anyone else in full but just the hint is that,as long as i’m concerned,my level wouldn’t have been achieved if i didn’t become so cruel on everything and everyone in personal life,my full nature had to be superimposed upon my bunch without any hindrence and this is the whole reason i didn’t marry you after Sinnoh though i so much wanted,my bunch needed me more than you did then and i realized it what i did later is my fault ever being not beside my friends in their most crucial time but going to Unova then isn’t and becomeing so cruel later too isn’t cause everyone knows the reasons and what my fault was was what i was trying to get away from at that time in the absolute wrong way and that’s my ego that i’m honest no matter what i do just this idea not the actual thing were.i told Trace this once in a negetive way but it’s true once i made myself believe that i’m that illusive ‘THE HONEST MAN’..it’s an illusion cause if you are really that you don’t need to announce that to yourself and now you understand everybody is that but don’t need to try to make themselves believe in that but the path is somthing unimaginably difficult than words and it’s not absolute i’ve travelled only a small way as you and anyone else has but hence my experience matters which is unique and not repeatable at all cause of luck and chance and finally all you can do is to try to be yourself as the reasult won’t matter cause as i said it’s useless to believe that i’m going to get that result cause it’ll fall one day if not oiled,you the soul will never cause that is the oil and thus it’s polluted if rubbed the wrong way of beliefs appearing in illusions self created.i don’t have any idea myself what i’m talking about cause i’m not enlightend like the great saints who told these cause i’m only walking their paths just started and not finished and this road doens’t end but neither is it that they are absolutely all true because of who said it cause as well they are not me and viseversa but that’s the whole point of battling as well win loss draw doesn’t matter the joy only matters and of general life as well.so i’m walking the path as much i can to understand things about myself more and more cause of who i am and i can’t express it as you know it’s self realization but that too is different to everyone and if a degree of joy is enough for you you’ll never compare it with another cause it’s pointless then and that’s the central part of my bunch and style and all.i have to know who i am and then stay with that idea as much as possible without any actions outside to make myself believe in it just carrying out the day to day life and all and if i can stay with it day to day life is automatically fixed as from me only my actions,except the physical and mental natural ones,has come into exsistence and not the other way around as when i was in my mom’s womb i had no idea what is what but i was and so that’s the thing that it’s about interaction and not trying anything the joy extracted from the interaction is maximized if we stay with ourselves and nothing else and thus you also know the idea of soulmate,if projected out,you can’t stay alone at all and hence my endeavors only.Mist,i totally deleted you off and Misty Waterflower became cough and spit to me untill i realized the other way around that day and that’s why i wasn’t happy when i didn’t have you,14 or 1400 would never matter if you weren’t my soulmate,i would’ve never returned and also if i didn’t have the realization still because of that cough and spit idea being imbibed illusively and wouldn’t have returned had you or me died.i was desperate to test who is who and what is what and i didn’t care i fig where i’ll end up but as the reality is,i WILL end up to you and the viseversa.my words are from books thus seems abstruce but anyone may try it they will get it their way,not mine.i was what i was after my break up and intuitively i knew i’ll either get everyone back or if not,then i will atleast have my bunch with me no matter of my human self and lunacy if i tried to be a Gengar cause that they were my soulmates was clear to me before you but it was sudden and thus i’m just lucky to have it and i truely can’t describe or specify to you what i know cause i have no words for how i look at pokemons cause they are exactly human to me with some restrictions and this idea will not leave me beyond death and hence my career has come to and end and i’m running everywhere to share it and tell people to not be greedy cause they are you and you’re harming yourself and this is harming my personal life which is dreadfull cause you are the same and i’m leaving you but i can’t tell them no now,that’s dishonesty to my bunch cause i got them prepared for what they want all time that’s fun of adventure and making new friends that’s exactly why i’m going out but won’t anymore cause i won’t promise them again cause exactly that promise is my ego but this they won’t realize and those creating the mess won’t only i will and i’ll get the consequences.anyway let’s cometo grosser terms,If i married you after Sinnoh i would’ve been great personally and all but at the cost of my bunch who would’ve followed suit gleefully cause they themselves don’t know and that’s exactly the reason why i’m the master and they’re my followers in this term of life no matter what it is in reality.i must serve my role that i’ve chose before coming here and that’s the thing.if i ran back to you during Unova i would’ve been a great friend and THAT HONEST MAN,you so much cherished-yes that’s exactly what was my Ash to you then not this Ash that you know as you now,but that honest man was my ego which i cut off in front of you and your ego of responsible big sister as well as you know.my ego of making myself beileve that i’m honest no matter what i do as i don’t mean any harm was hindering my bunch cause they weren’t getting my intentions and was misbehaving as they never knew what and where they were mentally only having the faith that i myself atleast won’t harm them.your pokemons will listen to you cause they think you’re just them and that’s why they battle for you,they need this light to tell them who they are and then only they do things thus you see no matter what you do all you can only do is to become youself which will be reflected in them if you’re fontunate enough to have them even in singularity thus Mime is exactly like us but a different temperament cause mom has her and she is mom’s refection in terms of subtle nature which again i can’t explain injust realize and thus i’ve no match in pokemon world profession because i get them as if i’m exactly a pokemon and the viseversa and thus their intelligence though we know in reality we’re different but only due to our appearing existences to each other.another with more playfullness than me is my friend and we can’t be compared by any means gross or subtle as you see we’re very happy to be just ourselves and the moment we see each other we’ll forever hug it and joke it out exactly like you and me but not so strong cause we’re soulmates they are not upto that level but friends truely and that’s why in this term of life,this family and my sis is important to me in different degrees and that’s why they’ve come back like they have despite facing my most cruelty which they did only because we’re so attached.and that’s exactly why my bunch can fondle that i can’t cause they belive i can and i only know that i’ll have to die even if scared to be beside them if death comes cause if i don’t i’ll not be honest at all and an idea then will grasp me that you said you’re an honest man,but see you’re not it’s an ego still but the thing is that i despite knowing that i lost my soulmate and didn’t do anything will make me die and go to them-yes such is why this is what it is,just can’t be separated no matter who tries their hands at the other way around themselves.if that day comes they’ll fondle death like Feraligator and Crawdaunt did but all i can do is to die with this idea that i’m not going alone atleast another two is there and this they exactly know or believe in hence their power they thing they know my human existence as well as i do so do things that they do which i don’t understand at all my brothers here do cause they know anout genetics and all.i can only try to stay as myself and they’ll see me and do what they do and i’ll try to guide them to be themselves and try to be themselves and they myself its’s exactly the relation of soul and if in one moment you don’t have it,just jump if they need you cause the end is inevitable that if you don’t still the same so why be afraid-this exact fear isn’t a fear that a soldier conquers or a man whoose family is being attacked my pokemons but more subtle cause in all above there’s a reason to do so and that’s not here cause you’re alone as pokmeons aren’t you and viseversa no matter what you say and think and are.they will never be me and viseversa and soul doesn’t die so i’m ever alone but ever full if only i know who i really am and stay with it.i left you and went to undercover then Kalos all for my bunch and Elite4 was myself,i realized this interaction intuitively and could also guess that they needed me first in Unova but then my honesty mask was disturbing me as i was subjected to public glare cause and i was trying believe that i’m honest and so went full on about it cause in my mind i was ever with my Mist here and never left home and still the same that i was just after i went out of my home to get my starter pokemon.after that incident in public the spitting one,i was confused that if for even one moment in that short space of time i gave in to my emotions and forgot who i was,forgot you were there,forgot everything and gave in to the emotion then my honesty mask told me,go full on with it,yes,exactly infidelity cause you’re honest aren’t you,even if you cheat you know it’s just about nothing and Mist is there,why bother,cheat just don’t do THAT and don’t get vulgar and that’s all,kiss people around hug people around stare people around just don’t do THAT,that’s all cause doesn’t matter just the moment cause you know ACTUALLY its’s ONLY Mist.enjoy yourself you’re HONEST about YOU aren’t you that it’s ONLY MIST? This will eventually mean you’re a pokmeon in a herd and thus the stuff.then i was asked in my mind that this honesty mask is saying so but what is this honesty,all depends on what you were taught and handed down so this mask can get away with cause you can marry 100 and divorce 100 then another and also kill 100 hug 100 then kill the next pokemon and human so all that you know values and all all just emotional mental stuffs dependent only on conditioned so this mask is here cause there is a thing called honesty which is that i want one but you know it’s useless cause you know about body and all so what is this all about...these ideas were pouring down on me and was creating a mess cause i didn’t know anything about anything..the world as i know was just totally upended and i had to ask myself what is and idea what is gallantry things like that cause all were emotinons and luck and dependency and that’s all and now i’m much more clear but then there just flooded me off cause i was in a circle that to be honest is to not be dishonest to be which you have to be honest somewhere before and so a cycle never ending unless you give up the whole notion and now as i do just spit and cough the end i’ll be who i’m that’s it and if this is throughly ingrained you can’t do a harm cause you’ll not find any reason to do good to begin with what to speak of the opposite..just like bunch all you’d want is to play around like a 5 year old totally careless about everything and the joy is just from inside just enough to forget the surrounding but then these weren’t clear and i was all over the place and infidelity was why i didn’t want to talk with you then cause i wasn’t sure whether that moment i gave in or din’t and this idea made me turn on everything and my confusion my bunch caught as they in general catches your emotion and they never knew what they were where they were mentally nothing..so i decided the only way to test my honesty and get off from the mask is to to the press and all and yet if somebody wanted to be personal with me then just mercilessly prey upon them cause i wanted the millions at my door to chew them off so prove to myself that i was honest and not make me believe that doesn’t matter i am honest cause my soul was telling me that dishonesty makes no sense at all cause if honesty like this creats this mess and hurt so will the other way around so it makes no sense and thus you should’nt be bothered about people and relations at all don’t give a damn about them play around like a kid totally careless,i was out to stay with the idea that i’m honest and no matter what happens outside i’ll stay as honest rather before when i was doing things and got results and thought or believed that i was honest...so first thing Cilan you know chides me cause his ‘mam has made a mistake selecting me,i lost it at that moment cause that was infidelity to me which i was fighting against,that was the only time i really wanted to kill the whole world off immediately cause for all along i was hearing newes about you Cilan was ever at my years all of you here the same and you i could sense was losing faith from upon me slowly and all and now i had this illusion myself and this guy is making it worse cause i can see how infatuated he is with this idea of young flower dream no matter ho truely respectful way and now getting personal with me..i lost it just then and this devil that saves me cause it’s my soul thus the dark psychic fairy..told me chew this guy upon mercilessly and show him what is infatuation and where it stands againt honesty if you’re really honest that is show him what honesty actually is,so told him him he wants to know about mistakes,come to the next gym that was dragon type,(),in Unova whole world knows it...i told the leader 3 on 3 full force you come at me and they knew my name and all so i said i want to test myself against a true legend like you and your bunch,Mr (),that is anyway,he goes in with his best 3-> first his very best a mega evoluted Garchomp,whom you surely know,i have one myself from Unova itself but after this badge and him you saw,he is the all-known about everything on reflections and thus irritates all...then Zekrom,this too came to me as you know,now fools around with anyone saying she is the weakest and always depressed and so on in Unova itself just before the championship and you’ve seen finally the mega Latios,who also came to me after my very last gym at Unova whom you’ve seen as well. So then i didn’t know them at all and a mega Latios i never even read about i only knew upto their whitwit part and mine has gone beyond any level and Zekrom and Garchomp as well and you know he fools around whole time with his idea of sky and earth and water is same thus pesters everyone around saying he doesn’t see any different between these type disadvantages thus anyone can yuse any attack like him and he can’t use grass attacks so gets into trouble with GuzzLord who is ethical Lord all the time...
a mega-Garchomp took 30 seconds,Zekrom took 32 seconds,mega-Latios took 2 minutes 43 seconds cause she was trying to play as that’s her nature so took a bit more cause Chu had to irritate her first to cajole her into best moves...yes,Chu did it to 3 best legendary dragons in Unova in the most famous gym all straight sent to pokemon centre cause they were severely injured and it took 2 thunder-chair each for first,one for last and that was really even made Mr () a bit concerned but the girl was alright...i ask him if he thinks i was trying to kill his bunch,smiles puts his arms on my shoulders and says,‘my Zekrom is electric dragon,supposed to just laugh-off a Pikachu and you should know mine did use his best thunder-chair cause that’s what i meant,and you saw the self heal and Pikachu can laugh off 10 such in 32 seconds if he wants to,Ash,i’ve never seen anything like this and can think so easily,those whoever told you you’re trying to kill off opponents should ban any electric type pure or mixed totally banned forever cause they by accusing you and Pikachu are hindering this legendary thunder-chair and stopping the growth.i’m 56,i’ve been in this since 21 and you must’ve heard about me,just go on lad,don’t pay any heed to anyone,atleast you’ll have my support till end and till you’re legal,and i say legal cause just don’t get dissapointed if you don’t find any challengers,just tell them my bunch is too strong for battling and they’ll just give you a comfortable seat in a great position,just be with your bunch and enjoy life that’s all don’t get into illegal business that’s my only wish cause we won’t see you and your bunch many times in next some number of years.i know what honesty has made a tifle electric type Pikachu to today thrash may be the best dragon gym in the world and they were my best 3 and all went to absolute full as did i.if you were dishonest you wouldn’t have survived Garchomp’s first proto charge what to speak of this.finally i haven’t spoken this long in years to challengers,but Ash,just my best wishes for you,ever will remember you,best wishes,here’s your badge but it should be you giving me cause i’ve been totally defeated in battle,but just seen you and your starter Pikachu,that’ll be enough for this life to remember that i’ve seen an once ever legend so humble still to ask me if the most basic question of a novice but who has all respect and the most most common but self dignified man,’am i not being honest’,just best wishes’..hugged me for a moment i smiled and said thanks i’m just so lucky to be able to meet you too and you’ll always remain a gym leader who kindly thought that i was worthy of the badge despite of me then he just smiled and we hugged again went off...Cilan didn’t obviously see this just the fight and then he is a breeder with great skills so i asked him,and he checked the dragons Zekrom was extremely injured but not fatal and so was Laritas,Garchomp was least injired...a ground,a electric, a physhic Dragon types of all and best evoluted in best gym in the world,evaporized in 4 minuted the leader who himself his a true legend says you’re a legend not a criminal,Mist,that made me realize i can’t harm pokemons,that was my 153 th gym as you know then i travelled myself got Garchomp and Zekrom and you know Unova is famous for dragons,then Garchomp came to me after 1107,Zekrom after 208,i used Garchomp in 213,won and then in finals used Zekrom who was also good then kept them for a bit,they instantly became fool-around after one year here with my bunch and i used them in Kalos and now you see them,Garchomp was free came by himself hust the formality of one attack from Noivern so that i proved to him that i’m strong enough as well,Zekrom all by herself,Latios same and Garchomp infact was later sad that he was caught unlike the other two and i also have a Rayquaza from Unova you know,he wants to  make everybody including humans dragon types means you have to flamethrow underwater or for humans appease him with your knowledge on everything about dragons and he’ll pester you by trying to make you fondle his tail and then fondle you as you get near...all four totally doesn’t know anything and so sweet and jovial you will want to fondle these dreaded dragons all your life like pets as you’ve seen....after this gym i still continued 5 gyms and then went to the titles and so on,so i then knew atleast to pokemons i wasn’t being promiscuous but this idea of cheating on you gripped me that i wasn’t sure whether if i looked at a person of the opposite gender whether i was adoring her physical beauty or mental qualities or behaviours with me or not and thus i didn’t know who you are either as i thought may be you’re the same like all just my 14 year infatutaion and mistake...so i found no meaning in the idea infidelity is all was just for physical purpose and you gave in at anytime mentally even thinking that somene is cute...this was the greatest trap that had opened,the illusion says,’honest with pokemons,you’re then a pokemon,but you’re human,so you should behave like a pokemon means you that promiscuity to full degree’...and i totally lost it..i thought well i’ll see what is what,and the only way is to detach yourself from everything to know who i really was and just be with pokemons cause they knew who i was if i didn’t properly but i still intuitively know pokemons and not a bit about humans,but i’m a human so i should know and go to the end to see...i knew i can’t be a monk or something or like Sabrina,i never felt that way and much later realized you were the reason cause we can’t stay away cause we’ve been born in 2 different bodies but then it was an intuition only and thus i thought i must make a deal and came back for the last try to rescue my relationship with all but i told myself i will always defend myself and never say sorry cause as a friend and the honest Ash Ketchum i made a Mistake yes,as a soul i didn’t cause till my last my bunch needed it and no matter what i had the right to do what i felt from soul the best and if that takes me to be alone,i will be alone but this soul i have to find else i’m nothing but a pokemon and thus can go all about it while still being honest...i needed my mask of honesty to get rid of...then the break-up then undercover where i still didn’t know but i could see that i was inherently honest and couldn’t think of dishonesty despite having all chances and thus my bunch became stronger and stronger then went to Kalos studied and learnt then that same incident when happened by then i knew what i was and statred to go at anyone cause by then i was what i was,i was happy and never cared for anyone at my core cause i didn’t depend upon anything material or abstruct for my happiness...then Elite4 and all along this idea and intuitive longing for you was there and never knew it so now i negeted the human world cause no more infidelity or generosity and so on could do anything cause i knew i’m not depened on a thing but just that emptiness was there which of course then was fulfilled as i got you but i saw you were left all alone and was waiting for the sinister helpless for something...i still didn’t believe even till that day me met in the noon at the Lab that you really are me,my Mist.later you did tell me in the very beginning that how much you long for me but for you that was about still the honest Ash,not the real one...then finally when you had it,you were taken back and sealed in my soul,you’re not leaving me at all once again another time i got to know that Mist is my soulmate.now look Mist,the point is the whole process and all,you know finally we will meet but my and dad ware similar.my mom isn’t like me,so my skills are of no use it’s about how far you can push your bunch telling them they and you always interacting via soul-this idea as much as possible..they will do the rest all by themselves...but the trouble is they still may not be able to battle,look i’m a 6 league champion,undercover legend and Elite4 destroyer not for nothing,you know how i was from day one and how many innumerable battles i did and all,how well i know about this whole pokemon world..that is the more the better...Goldy is your best Pokemon and exactly like your own nature but in fornt of me if he is imbibed with one hint of idea that his master wants to defeat the challenger,me,he will be laughed off again...i can’t be beaten i can only be made friends with in pofessional life.that’s the end of career cause to me,that’s ultimate.finally,you own nature helps you all the time especially against lunatics who wants their pokemons to kill everyone or against cruel geniouses like the greatest boss of whom you’ll want to face the boss everyday cause you can affect him if you’re honest and get upto him but not the first kind against whom you have to be cautious at the same time being playfull cause the caution is of your own physical safety.i need that if these pests are like that...in my experience,no legend will ever be tamed via power but always by laughter..i faced one as you know he would’ve smoked both me and Muk in history in less than half a second with his Physchic charge alone if we had anything else except frinedship and fun in our mind which we didn’t and it made Lugia totally dumbfounded and later just became so happy to be a friend and that was the time i was most agitated personally cause i knew who my soulmate was but had to make her realize that and really test that but even before check my own idea again...still i never wanted to do anything except fun and so the legend became my and Muk’s friend then i took him to a centre cause he was extremely abused they cured him within a week or so flew off...look i did this much still won’t come with me cause he is ever free,he will come only to be my friend and then only i can tame him,tame,catch anything means befriend,that’s what it’s all about.No,none should try to copy me cause they can’t as i can’t copy them,they’ll become full lunatic if they try their hands at this cause i myself was at the verge of lunacy and eventual death becoming a Gengar in human form and i did it intuitively never and still don’t know what i’m doing so all else should just try their way but they will reach this level of friendship even if that doesn’t reflect in pokemons skills,their pokemons too will be ever jovial but may not be like mine who can do anything against legends cause mine had been trained day after day that knowledge won’t go and that’s unique...but they don’t need to be my copy nor do i,this is a big world none is for none...if you’re happy because only of yourself,that’s it.if situations come in your way just tell them you mean no harm to others and you want to battle purely for fun and nothing else,though this is a hard idea as fun can get you in serious trouble as well cause any best battlers like Laura vs Katy is that and my Pikachu alone can decimate 20 combined of any type of them now may be even at one go in less than a minute...none can match mine in power and anything cause if they are not friends,they’ll be made and no matter how powerfull,Pikachu won’t kill anyone or any of my others unless i’m physically threatened and they are with me,then they will suicide as well cause they won’t be alive if they have killed another person or human unless i want them to as that’s the instruction.i have tested this and i’m happy till something really gets to my nerves but i don’t care for that at all cause i’ll try to be who i’m till my last moment...anyway,Mist,as i said just make them calm and jovial and don’t do anything with Goldy at all...Chu will teach them how to be calm cause your whole gym pokemons takes him may be 20 seconds max to evaporate completely if he wants cause his level may be now 4 Raftosmoric at their best so they can’t tame him by angering him and thus can’t stop him bossing them thus the only way is to fool around with him is to do exactly why he’s threatening you,’be my friend and don’t cross me cause with this power you and i both will die,why waste your time when none of us or our masters really mean it and mine doesn’t for sure’...now if they don’t listen cause their master is lunatic Chu will start to fool around with them first but he’s not Crawdaunt,he has a limit of tolerance unless it’s his friend or mutual friends which pool is more than 72% in this world i guess,almost anyone he personally saw or his bunch or he battled with,stupendus and infinite memory but mind it he has only seen Lugia and he spoke to him a little but Lugia was very weak and we had to depart and i have no idea what Lugia’s experiences are with other legendary pokemons.Lugia’s interpretation by Chu and Muk was just that he wants to play around and i was a very good master but he was too week and wanted to sleep but he will try to come back and meet me again cause he likes me and he also wanted to fondle me but just was exhausted...i just pat him a bit and he looked very happy then dozed off,instantly called all...let him go after treated all i learnt was that he was saying that he was very happy to know good human beings cause he hadn’t seen any and he would tell others that there are good humans too..and did fondle a few people there to death with extreme psychic powers to halluciante them to death and then was trying to understand them more and the instruments but didn’t like the confinement and becasme a bit suspicious then was again happy when they let him go but they said incredible intelligence might’ve already learnt a lot about good humans to him and all stuffs but said very suspicious that cause he was abused for 6 years and 5 and half took taming cause Lugia later the highest boss said was too freedom loving but more available easily than Mewtwo and more genial cause Mewtwo is psychic/fight yet Team Rocket never managed one cause never got one alone so may be it’s the herd or just too intelligent to even gauge human actions of it is suspicious to them by certain signals...and Mist,know for sure i’m going there with 107 legends myself who are if equal type is equal to 4 rarest legends themselves...that is their level now and that’s why i know so much about legendary pokemons i’ve been doing this since my second year at Unova after may be 10 months there.But Mist i again tell you Chu might be 4000 Raftosmorics BUT that power is only electric type the legendary psychic will make Chu trifle if he tries to battle one cause you know well psychic powers are neither manifested properly by a pokemon unless they want nor can it be scaled in a proper manner and mostly if two Raftosmorics charge at each other both may be destroyed what to speak of 4000 against 1 cause that 4000 is self destructive mood and that’s why legends are so rare and roams in such small groups and hardly uses any attacks except psychics...never try to challenge a legend no matter how powerfull you are cause the legend will die but will take you and your bunch with him in cosmic darkness as that’s where there real power is and that no electricity can tame or be effective..a Raftosmoric can’t be killed by any lower legends if another Raftosmoric they can only be psychiced ou and killed thus same by a higher legend who has more psychic powers and only then that legend himself will survive after he kills Raftosmoric by psychicing him out  all these fights are of intelligence never power,they don’t show powers at all thus i say 4 is 1 Chu but i’m only estimating and predicting don’t know reality neither does Chu know it and i don’t know Chu’s biology myself as my bros do neither does Chu know mine like i do..this fight isn’t about power or stategy or friendship it’s about hugging and loving death..totally different ground,who appeases death it winner..my bunch no matter psychic or ghost,can’t win against a legend toe to toe no matter if they are 107 together against 1 Ghostradarkarrigussonor cause the fight will take place in cosmic darkness where you can’t differentiate anything thus you may never return back and this is exactly why i need to go cause others do not realize that it’s not a power game anymore cause they haven’t used the machines when they should’ve had and thus i need to babysit the legends back home cause all else will foolishly try to fight and go down self destructing and the whole region might be in a trouble if they charge at humans or the powers go out of hands.LEGENDARY FIGHTS ARE ABOUT INTELLIGENCE AND FOR US HONESTY CAUSE IN DARKNESS 1 OR 4000 ALL ARE SAME LIKE 1 GUN AND 4000 YOU HAVE YOU CAN’T USE 4000 AT THE SAME TIME BUT ONLY ONE SO YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ON LEVEL GROUNDS IN A DUEL..IT’S ABOUT HONEST ALL AND ALL...AS YOU MAY HAVE TRAVELLED 10000 MILES FOR 10 YEARS IN DARK FOREST NIGHTSS,NEXT ONE STILL A NEW,STILL YOU HAVE TO BE ALERT,thus is legendary fights,MY BUNCH NEEDS THAT PATIENCE EVERYDAY AGAINST A LEGEND that is what is about power and all about legends...anyway,Chu’s temperament if with me is an issue but at human level interaction he is the best but try to change that temperemental nature of him cause he suits you more than me,he is too fond of me as his little bro and is ever overprotective of his little bro but to you it’s that he is your friend for life and together he will boss me around that’s what he picked up first day in you and never forgotten cause that relation you have with me is unique and he saw it for 5 long years day and night 24 hours and understands it as we were mere teenagers then our true feelings to each other manifested the most cause we never were polluted by words,forms and ideas then but much later then just knew each other and wanted to play around with each other along with our pokemons which IS our real nature and thus you’ll remember there was never one thought of any difference was there between us that i’m a boy and you’re a girl,never and that’s exactly why we never could utter the word cherish cause we were far higher than any word could explain our relationship which to outsideres seemed strange until they got it themselves and again we have had to realize it further as well.anyway,Chu will become way less temperamental with you and that’s huge advantage cause of his powers and intelligence that you’ll see and playfullness too cause he knows every trick of each of my bunch and has his own cause he can improvise brilliantly if he wants as i saw atleast 55/60 different kinds of thunder-chairs itself all different class and he may have used 500 thunder-chairs by now,you’ll learn more about this as you read.so,Your bunch needs to learn to be calm and playfull as much as they can in case of emergency and Goldy will tell them who Chu really is as well as Starmie,Starew and rest who saw him for 5 years day and night if they have any confusion with Chu’s temperament.your Gyarados can’t beat a swellend up Politoad if properly swellened up what to speak of a lightrope-Ferdkojnap,the least strengthned water-lightrope-prohgomeric-dragon-loiver-sternet known,the last two to specify the legendary dragon part and the third to specify lightrope itself,and water again is legendary section which you know best and there are may be 10 known in total and a Suicune to a lightrope-Ferdkojnap is like a Magmorter in an Ocean and Suicune we were lucky to see but they have 5 categories and the highest being waternope breed may be 6 people alive has seen ever...and yes,they will have lightrope-Bernetur which is the 3rd strongest all abused and swellened up and charging at you..you must remain calm and try to befriend him cause no matter what he is,is not a human thus doesn’t know the idea killing only interpreting in his own cognition from his master to get more and more angry and go full blast eventually self destructing which if they understand the opposing party is friends will never do and that power may be if possible become jovial like my bunch and then with that he’ll try to fondle everyone,that’s a Pokemon for you,no matter what the master is doing..in these cases you’re there to befriend the pokemon first and formost and human we all know be polite and gentle to anyone then if he’s a brat he will do what he does don’t bother he will go either to hell or heaven once he realizes his pokemons are not going to listen to him ever again but that’s a different matter of a killer that’s our problems not any pokemon’s.Mist,just to tell you,this world you know and those against like the greatest boss just no comparison what so ever,don’t take youself seriously and think of anything or anyone even your soulmate if you want to get the job done and your soulmate you know always you thus with you.get one emotion of seriousness forcefully and your dead along with your bunch,in undercover there’s no point of being serious cause you know you’ve hugged death already so it’s just about the time and the moment so why bother,this nature as much as you have your bunch will get it and will remain calm against a swelled up ashed-Suicune brigade chargeing at full force with all attacks possible including Psychic.you’ll die no more.just try to be playfull and calm cause the pokemons aren’t killing you their masteres are and if this idea you and your bunch can somwhow project that their master is trying to fight and yours befriend they will instantly get confused and then turn on their own masters to fondle them to death to tell him that all is fun and the more honesty you have the more the lunatic human against you will be calm.and Mist,i must tell you this that this idea of befriending you have to go through more to realized by those things i’ve told and given you cause i tell you something as it has just occured to my mind as i’m saying all these,Mist,there’s a legend called Ghostradrakarrigusonor,it’s primary ghost but probably has every single possible types and i just prey to God that those idiots haven’t got their hands on this legend and hasn’t swellened it up to maximum though only 1 substance which itself like the legend is difficult to produce is ever known to swell it up and also they can’t evolve this legend illegally cause they don’t know anything about it..years ago one legend was week and all they tried to treat him but still he befooled everyone and went away that associetation gave them some clue and thus this substance to actually control him may be yet they don’t know almost anything about the anatomy and all and this substance is just to make it sedative a bit not a power enhancing one but this substance if proper the legend will himself try to get out of this intoxicated state more and more according to the master’s orders and will creat trouble and they will find that substance from heaven or hell anyway and this legend is the greatest and most powerfull ever known and you know my ghost types and you can realize what a Ghostradarkarrigussonor is really...why i tell this is say he’s against Gengar you know what Gengar is he’ll pley beyond his death without any letting up in intensity and fun thus say the legend understands that Gengar only wants to play doesn’t want to battle now say the legend’s lunatic master is also realized by the legend as an intruder so he’s taken care of BUT and this is why he is the highest legend ever known is that now he wants to play with all pokemons NOT humans THUS I’M STILL an intruder to him and he will want to remove me cause one his own master looks like me and his nervous communication is like me so am i and thus he has a trouble this any legendary types has but the trouble with very high ones and this one is highest is that now if you say i’m your friend and i want to play with you as well he will NEVER STILL believe you cause he DOES NOT see you JUST AS GENGAR..you to him MUST be EXACTLY your GENGAR.if you give him 1 signal that you’re any different to him no matter how best you care,he will send you on that very moment in cosmic darkness cause that’s an intruder to his life now and this trick will be played with Gengar cause he will be told by the legend that all is well but why are you connected with your master so much i also want to connect so that i can too play with him..he wants to use Gengar’s own chanell to test my intensions with his own intelligence and test it this channel sharing is very few can do but this one will do at his leasure the first thing and actually he is still thinking Gengar is infact fooling him just as we humans do in such circumstances cause NOT of Gengar BUT due to my connection with him.Gengar is just his channel to know me that’s all.if i ever have 1 intesion where i try to be not Gengar to Gengar,i’m done in that very moment..the legend in fact i tell you just like a 5 month baby wants to see who his mom is cause he is not on her lap but someone elses which lap is very good but he feels uncomfortable cause it’s not his mom..yeah that’s pokemon thought process but we suddenly see this great lenegend and thus get greedy..and a 5 month child will only realize that this new lap is as safe as his mom’s only when he gets that assurance which how he will get you never know same as pokemons thus through Gengar you must tell him in all honesty that i’m Gengar as well..depends exactly on who you are and how well you know who you are after a certain span Ghostradarkrrigusonor will realize it and will fondle you to death and may be most human beings to death as well but then will be cheated upon his trust again cause he won’t recognize deceit like we do once he has trusted someone...this span is all about seeing 2 Gengars and all about how much Gengar you are yourself and at that time can wholeheartedly deliver...at that moment your whole world is being Gengar and absolutely nothing else,no soulmate,no death,no life,no friends,NOTHING...if you do well great but if you fail your Gengar will still be saved but he will be extremely dissapointed that his master cheated him cause now the legend will say you lied your master isn’t a Gengar to you just like my master cheated on me...everyone is a friend to their pokemon Mist,but not their pokemons themselves means just this idea of being a pokemon as much is imbibed in your blood the better you are but again a lot more is needed cause you’re facing death and wanting to be a Gengar...far more than a soldier needs in a battlefield..it’s about just who you are and how satisfied your life is..one thought in that say absolute maximum 1.25 minute span and no it won’t be more than that but that span if not properly handled then you’re done your Gengar will turn on the whole world as well...you can tame any legend by friendship if they are naturally harmed and can’t go back home in an island like we tried to do to that Mew in (),Johto but you NEVER will be able to just like that befriend an abused legend suddenly out of his intoxication cause now he’ll be doubting the whole world as the baby doesn’t know who mommy is no matter what and how tenderly others say he’ll test and never blindly on faith believe it..you know a 5 month old anyone can tackle for 5 minutes but not 30 and you need to give him that trust in 5 to make it 30 exactly what the legend wants HE WANTS HIS MOM NOT HIS FRIEND..simple this...just like i wanted my soulmate Mist and not the illusion Misty...hard these are but just telling you as they come and you realize the practise isn’t at battlefrield or even your own bunch it’s to yourself and hence my confusion in Unova and subsequent haunting in Kalos libraries and talking to people going in universities where to them i was a Ghostradarkarrigussonor...this is the model as much as i’ve followed 20 minutes with my bunch instantly picked it up and themselves heightened their powers and playfullness cause all they want is that light that this is me lets be in delight,that’s pokemons for you too.But this all is a model as i tell you so many times that there’s no assurance in it,i just tried to say what i have in thoughts and ideas very little and insignificant is this and finally it applies to me only which is the most important thing to understand.i just said cause i was asked in my mind that’s all.about legendaries and what they do Trace and all will say infinitely more which you absolutely must digest as much as you can otherwise you will not be able to maintain that span i talked about and rush as new kinds of legendary psychics will pour down upon you and you will think i’m done lets go either to death or the legend himself will feign that he is tamed and you’ll think i’m done but as you let up you’re done truly.yeah,that’s why he is the highest legend.so mostly you will have to be on the spot and thus in the end it’s all about you even if you don’t have any prior knowledge just like i wouldn’t have if i faced a darkened-Mewtwo during undercover but i’m sure myself that she or their Arceus would have been on my side once they knew my two water buddies but before that if i faced Mewtwo and Arceus together at the same time,i would’ve been there against them like this may be 3 seconds but wouldn’t have been here today that i know also for sure..just forget this idea as much as you can that you’re something different to them and your effort will manifest.this will though be Mist not Ash and thus the characteristics will be different in your bunch and may be they’ll be way more caring and all like you are and not so playful,to you they are ever your best friends but your nature is just like all of your sisters more or less that all of you want to play around and enjoy yourselves,pokemons are just a means of your soul to express the joy that you’re having being here like they reflect your own dreams in which you’re playing with most dear little toys who reciprocates and this joy that you have you want to share with a very special person after your parents,this person is your soulmate and hence this is what it is...and this also is why i hate the word DESTINY because it’s not suitable here,you’re nature is more your soulmate a little less on pokemons thus you’ve been able to battle more throughly than Daisy who is rather in equilibrium and thus hasn’t been able to battle for long...now that i’m saying i should say my interpretations for the family as well cause you never know which ghost you have to face but that’s trivial all i want is to make the road easier in case of interest cause it took me 4 years through many beautiful situations...i will speak about my self the last but to tell you this and thus may be also to make sure when you will know that i’m no more here with our future still only a possibility till now not a concrete stuff and you know you’re fine but i’ve had to do rather than happily reciprocating to do cause you know well that i wasn’t prepared for this at all after getting you back 4 years later i needed to settle myself down for a few months but again just wordplay doesn’t matter i only can see him or her on your lap so,basically if that somehow doesn’t happen and you don’t get the life that my mom has had then there will be trouble for you and this time it will be hard cause now we’re family and they will try to protect you by all means but you yourself will again try to shut yourself in the gym and resorting to techniques now so that i with our future is ever present and you’ll want to die sooner to join us which is a mistake cause you don’t know what happens after death or even just that moment before when you’re all alone and the whole life is infront of you demanding justification of your soul so that you will transmigrate happier or less so...both you and me can’t stay single cause of our realtion there and age here and if one goes so abruptly the other will unknowingly suffer...anyway,thus again for your idea and all,i spoke about Daisy as much as it seemed to me in my capasity and knowledge but i know Trace much better as you realize and he is exactly similar to Daisy just a bit here and there to fit the two sides in the right way as all of us know ourselves of their natures as much as it appears to us..Brock you know ever too caring and thus needs someone to reciprocate that as in soulmate and Violet ever too much a little kid who wants to give similar attention to everything thus ever longing for someone like Brock who will ever take care of her and all while she plays around be it pokemons or others thus the relationship..Gary we all know just ever wanting the emotional side to be taken care of and again the soulmate idea cause without that he’s not full and that’s only too visible in his case and Lillie’s case is the opposite,she needs the not-emotional side to be sorted out as Lillie is as you know,ever wants to fondle everything and thus Gary is there to keep he in check cause suddenly she has to deal with this mess called ideas,bodies,forms-the world...thus they need each other and thus the unit as a whole....anyway,my nature is that i want to become everything and see things through their eyes exactly as they do and hence my pokmeons are too playful whole time cause that’s thair ultimate nature well any living being’s ultimate nature is exactly that human or not that’s the stuff..and they are gettig my support so going full about it and for me that is exactly what i was doing i fell upon everything and everyone mercilessly cause what i didn’t have and that’s the part of me to keep me grounded is that i want to become exactly everyone thus i myself won’t have any separate existence thus simply evaporating in thin air and that you see isn’t possible cause as i told you,no matter what once you have the human form you’ll have a different nature so i can do whatever when i’m a soul and not a human as you and all else can cause then what is is not describable but which you will be able to describe the differece from you is the whole point of appearence of many on one as in soulmate it’s two thus to keep me here as myself and to make sure that i don’t obtrude others like my bunch etc in difference to be exactly like them no matter how much that is good for them but i’ll still be different in this life so to stay here alive and sane i need someone who will be with me beyond all deaths and will have unfathomable longing for me exactly what you represent and for you i’m there cause you will want someone to be with you while you fool around and try to boss everyone around like a little 5 year old child does and what you ever become to the whole world when i’m with you and you will never be able to be yourself here now cause you want everything to be different from you so that you can play with them YET have unfathomable longing for a PARTICULAR ONE who is exactly you yet different and hence i’m here cause of my nature...Mist,we met that day in Viridian-DESTINY,we’ve all become a family like this-DESTINY,my bunch is like they are-DESTINY,i’m saying all these lines written in books and i got to know them and hear lectures on them and so on-DESTINY...even the fact that i’m married to you-DESTINY..yeah by chance no more as i said it can happen that we’re married to someone else....say you never existed in this world but i did and thus got married and all i would’ve had troubles then surely,but if i stayed SINGLE then,then i would’ve had no troubles at all cause you weren’t here and thus ever with me or i would’ve never even knew it or tried to know it cause i didn’t need it at all since childhood...but always situations don’t suit that and the biggest thing is the ILLUSION that created the difference between you and me to begin with,that’ll play around cause that’s part of human birth...but thus what is NOT destiny is our relation in between...IF WE ARE HERE TOGETHER AND OF THE AGE FOR LIKE WE CAN GET MARRIED AND ALL,WE WILL NEVER BE HAPPY UNLESS THAT HAPPENS...and exactly why people are not happy in so many such cases,it’s also DESTINY that you’re 20,i’m 60...no chance of marriage and all even if we meet BUT still we’ll not be happy at all if we’ve taken human birth at the same time except for the paternal or maternal relationship...now siblings are like limbs of the body born as your playmates but never the full body as you realize the same thing thet siblings don’t have the relationship among each other like parents and all that no matter the age...the full body will ever be your soulmate only in that relation and perents and own children are another completely different matter...so this is a chance that we’re in this like this but the realtionship is ETERNAL and thus imperishable...now lets come back to gross matters once more...with illusive legends like Ghostradarkarrigussonors you’ll neeed to strenghten yourself most cause you’re defence will be Butterfree and no more..you will not have another swellened up Ghostradarkarrigussonor as a defence so that you can jump on anyone and even if there you do you know the end result two worlds collide both having human beings living on them...so to get the job done and actually to manifest you heart and help the poor legend in plight you must be there BUT with as much preparation as you do cause they will connect you via your Butterfree and send innumerable psychic waves may be all unknown to disturb you enough to find faultlines in your relationship with Butterfree for that 2 minute span..and you’re human,thus all i said will haunt you exactly then as your mind is disturbed and Mist,this human body and mind is dangerous as i told you it needs oiling of all sorts..so no matter who you are and how happy with your soulmate and all,you WILL forget everything at that moment cause you’ll be facing DEATH the ever unknown...unless your ideas are oiled you will be able to face it in a battlefield and all but NEVER if you’re being mentally tortured to death like a very bad prototype that i showed you when i gave you my 4 years in 6.5 hours,Mist you know very best that i’ll not leave you no matter where you go being your soulmate thus you were phisically safe that day even if in general i’m not a murderer and you know that it was not a torture at all i was trying to tell you what you are to me in that language just to try to brak your illusion.BUT that moment against a legend you’ll have absolutely ZERO help ouside that i provided you,you’ll not be facing your soulmate but an unknown enemy no matter if he is just a 5 month old baby inside and you will get every bit of psychic tourture to actually kill you and not to tell you that you’re my soulmate please understand that and be with me again...the legend has got nothing to do with your human emotions he wants to be sure that he’s Butterfree to you the same thing my bunch wants all time that say Feraligator wants me to be him all the time and i as my nature only too hapily be so..thus he is getting the support and thus i say they are my soul cause they see me exactly like that...yes here as well,they are my soul and sees me like that but they are not humans so they are not may soulmate at all...those who can’t breed not due to natural condition like Snorlax,Muk,Mime,Mismagius,Whimsicott,Torterra,Beeheeyem,Dialga,Solgaleo,Glalie,Gourgeist and so on but can’t breed because they’ve heigtened their powers to be with me all the time like Feraligator,Bulbasaur,Greninja,Noivern,Darkrai,Palkia,Sableye,Zekrom,Krookodile,Tyranitar,Marshadow,Garchomp,Gengar,Confragigus,Lunala,Crawdaunt and so on especially almost all who came to me or was caught in Unova and Kalos and don’t bother about it is because i’m here with them so they get that pleasure being too playful as they have me as a substitute to them to make sure they are still happy...the day i die if they’re alive i suspect they will get too sad and die or will try to breed but won’t be able to do so and will go nuts unless they are among themselves like my group they will need their buddies like all those i mentioned are if together then it’s ok but if they are not getting them i think it’s better to terminate them cause they’ll get peace then atleast but you know terminating can be done only in 13 labs in the world and Oak Lab is one such in Kanto who fortunately is my starter too so all are on my brothers and sister-in-laws and that’s why it will ever be here that my bunch will be kept and except Professor Kukui,Naomi and Birch i don’t believe in anyone but they are not alone in their labs they have many pests to manage themselves so can’t be a substitute thus the vote is all about the 3 directors here who will take that decision...but the reason as i said for this need is applicable only when they come to know that i didn’t have any of my buddies with me and died...yeah if i die naturally atleast one of them must be present with me or someone i tell them they can trust and that’s why Mime is with my mom and Chu is here and they apprize them that i died naturally.if i’m murdered or something and don’t have the time to warn them and tell them whom to trust in my absence,they will turn on anyone they see including human and pokemon.thus i ever keep atleast one with me and they know either all of them are at the lab or where i told them to be even if  among the nature,or with me.just too much linked with me and viseversa we are somehow.and if in Unova they terminate my bunch by deceiving the whole world if i’m killed and they survive Mr Maple,Professor Kukui,Birch and Naomi as supporting Oak Lab and i hope Persy will be there as well they can very easily bring this to general law outside our profession and when my brothers support them it will mean irrevokable and immediate death penalty to the offenders as they are charged with murdering me too and the pokemons so a chain of destruction in general life will be the heaviest penalty and you know terminating a pokemon and then a whole bunch of 107 to begin with the evidences will not be erased easily at all and thus every 3 months these 2 labs at Unova and 2 at Kalos will be checked by the 3 labs and Oak Lab will be kept informed cause that isn’t possible in this situation and and this will be administrated by Persy and supported by Mr Maple.

Mist,you’ll not be me as i said no matter how much you try with this body and mind as different to me and thus their resultant inherent qualities apprearing through me no matter that i’m actually separated from them but with them present you know you can’t be me and thus your bunch won’t be like mine and so you will drive them according to yourself how you perceive them to be in your subconcious may be as i said as your sweet talking dolls in your dreams or that you’re their mom and all that you know only i don’t but you’ll get your job done against Ghostradarkarrigussonor if you can project this in your bunch as much as you can and then stay true to yourself in that 2 minutes that i can blindly tell you cause all he wants is not to be fooled again and have fun and as i said be on his mommy’s lap,but Mist once more you then will be Goldy but NOT Goldy’s mom or that Goldy is in your dream and only your toy-mind that,that’s the difference cause that legend will interpret you through Goldy cause he can’t interpret you directly..don’t get separated from Goldy,try to be him...he’s just like you as i said,others too more or less,Starmie certainly is,Starew nearabout too but a bit less cause you battled him more in your childhood.yes you’re thinking that then i’m unique that i only want to be them and you ever want to play WITH them but Mist,dream appears from your subconsious as well..sure they are more than you yourself cause you’re the sole creater of your dream...the difference is my bunch will try to be a Ghostradarkarrigussonor and now having even more fun in a new funny ground and being someone that they didn’t know personally before so see it through him what fun he has thus telling him that’s exactly what i want and see them as so now i’ll be rechecked through them via the legend..creating an abstract chain of fun is what my bunch is doing and in the process losing their own separate exsistence unknowingly through that fun and they want me ever to join that and now know that i’m ever too happy to join that..yours may tell him that he is their sweet plaything with whom they’ll fool around forever and now wants him amongst them so that he too fools around just like them with them and and that’s exactly what you do with them CAUSE YOU YOURSELF ARE EXACTLY LIKE THEM and now this idea will be checked...your bunch wants to make a chian of mutual best friends BUT not be them cause the best friends aren’t abstract thus you are Goldy but yet separate from Goldy so that you can enjoy Goldy..remember our teenage BEST FRIEND confessions,Mist?..exactly that...you view is like that thus will be your bunch IF you give them that chance...this difference of me but not me that you have,must not be tempered with at all cause thus is your soul represented by this body and mind of yours which in total that we’re calling Misty to just give a name as you try to be me only your bunch goes in water cause you’re no more wanting them to exist separately as you’re not interested in them anymore and you try to be not me then also your bunch goes in water cause your their friend but not them at all...this balance Goldy best represents when he tries to fondle all yet will battle all if you tell him to cause battling to him is again fooling around and the not me part is now shining when like you used to smack me to show how much you cherish me in the very first week of our journey through that forest before Brock came in when it was just you and me and i used to poke you even more...that fake fight and best friend part is your not me part and the hugs and holding my hands all were the me part...that’s exactly who you really are for this life and you need that balance to be perfect with all and i’m as i said special to you cause i’m your soulmate eternal and not about how we’re represnted in a singular life and thus only with me that is exactly perfect...it’s true Mist,that what i’m saying is too hard cause may be i’ve fought a thousand battles with all possible combinations mentally each day for 15 years till the last two months in undercover and that gives me the idea of what i’m doing and my bunch is as well..without this idea is very hard to know whom you’re dealing with as in pokemons in general cause battle or not their powers i know too well bit by bit like i know you and that needed me to be too attuned to them then 15 years later the jovial part took 6 months in Kalos and that was it...but this idea of self defense in them has to be erased as well to do what they do and that isn’t possible if i know what they know bit by bit about themselves and the powers they have then i won’t be able to control them either,it’s a two way assurence that i know you and viseversa lets work togethger as there’s no difference you have full freedom as do i...it’s elusive to achieve and i did it by luck but this too will fall if i don’t pass enough time with them or other pokemons for that matter like in gym cause all my memories and other things that i read and all will be kept refreshed cause with my now nature i see a Raticate,i’ll try to go to his maximum to be him and know everything about him..but if i don’t see a pokemon for 6 month continuously i’ll get detached and will have to come back again but them if my bunch is together the process will be more than too easy..but as i say,i must be among pokemons to maintain it else i will be good mentally but will get detached from my bunch and they may start misbehaving especially if they are not among themselves...but anyone in this world can try his or her hand at the attempt and thus you too can.yes also now i’m saying,don’t get too unhappy if i die and our future doesn’t materialize and all,cause you know what is inevitable well and that’s not even the memories that atleast we’ve had enough time together before today just the idea that yeah,i’m satisfied with my win at 1st round but not with my win in 2nd round so just wait till 3rd round happily to settle that.Anyway,just let these rounds thoughts off Dave you must integrate in family all your resposibility now whatever i’m leaving behind currently and the rest everything all they know and my contacts and uncover team rocket stuff and rest profession and all Dave knows and you will be your Ash now while being my Mist at the same time and just soak in the unique happiness of this grand family and future-theirs sure if not ours.That’s all and just know Chu will be there if i’m not and will be yours more than he ever has to me and thus always give him that license and never overprotect him cause he is a symbol of your soulmate living in front of you,don’t do that he’ll be hurt and would start misbehaving,use him as much as you can just like i used to give him all license but not in battles unless you feel so and he won’t make any demands from you which he ever has with me,just keep him with you as i have done,that’s what he wants.and finally Chu will be your’s beyond death cause i won’t be there again and he knows it well.’
..um..just a moment,no i’m fine with myself but everything came to be true and i recall that Sinnoh sermon and compare that’s why saying..i’ve my Ash with me that’s all(all smile and tears and all)..”
(Ash and Misty hugs each other very firmly and smiles at each other)...
Ash(laugh) : “well i’m sorry if it took the wrong turn but first i’m right here(laugh,all smile) and then tomorrow or whenever in timescale beyond it will be possible we will meet again at anytime through a certain jackal being his days and we’ll have a certain impersonal being his wig to balancedly help us with 2 words to make sure that VIA a certain crook being his certain stolen Mantinal artistry to cook a certain bug ever being to bug her certain BEST PLAYBOY as her...(all smile,tears and reciprocate)...so see you and yeah,if there’s any salt anywhere i’m sending Gengleye immediately and then the future will first utter the words sweet cute idiot(all smile).happy a Safforn Night(all smile and reciprocates and all).

(next time,2 days later,7,Th)
.....in the middle.....

Ash(laugh) : “well now don’t get too serious with it cause that was way before i saw those 4 buffoons and those 103 brats which did include a most rare proto-genesis-water-lightrope-thydos-prohgomeric-dragon-loiver-sternet-trovial type slew-evoluted-dribert-klinex-lightrope-Bernetur (burst into laughter,Tacey,Brock,Gary smiles and shakes their heads)...got Zekromed who later told me just said as she does too weak to fight,which got the Bernetur to just love it so she was charging up even more when Zekrom said like whinning(laugh)..why do you want to hurt me i’m only too weak,and and i cherish you so much(laugh)...then the brat got confused and cause of it’s psychic abilities tried to test Zekrom who as usual played her depression tricks which made the brat just to politely ask what’s the matter,to which she said she doesn’t know anything about anything cause she wants to be fondled by everybody that weren’t of her type(laugh),so the Bernetur was totally confused but this got her out of her own intoxication a little and then Zekrom continued and finally the two befriended and then the human brat that was trying to attack Zekrom was psychiced off by his own Bernetur and then she herself became weak and all went to a centre later 2 day recovery released,went away very happy...(all smile and .)...tell me about slew-evoluted-dribert-klinex-lightrope-Bernetur Trace,you first,just a bit in our kanguage..”
Tracey(smile) : “that type means the rarest known,barely seen master of psychofront-tronhumder-locituvel-sidenot-vestifular zapping(Ash laughs and shakes his head) as an attack though hardly all are known and can be too overprotective,which got you through there..nothing more..that dribert part is illegal you know,slew also possibly by tromtofrenistron..but very much possible if sertrynym is mixed but have to make her almost dead and in a certain body condition it will work extremely hard for water types..dribert is to secreate a may be 500 selogenes(Ash laugh) just to get that protective nature totally mad..Gary knows that klinex part best...”
Gary(smile) : “means a battle hardend slex then evoluted to klinexcidom then used r-dontruont to make way for klinex..klinex is achieved only if it has battled it’s own type a few times..(laugh,Ash laugh)..slex is 8th evolution and slex is 11th and highest,this was the most evolution and abuse possible...doctor how to even get that size and then that subtle water major type in...”
Brock(smile) : “eriphojnet virtobolasis with fortabulated antimoryn in solution of 87% cyropet-creolirid(Ash laughs others smile and shake their head)...this all just only to get their physcic ability less so that don’t misbehave and you can enter them inside safely then need to get just her unconscious with a double lengthed name(Ash,Gary laugh and Tracey smile and shakes his head)..rest all on God(Ash laugh)...and we know all these only cause you know our positions in our own fields and these are known from the highest degree books and all are barely tested once or twice in general and yes though Unova got only that part ok giving the best possible pokedoctos from Sinnoh,Kalos,Hoenn,Johto and Unova itself and as you see we and Orange aren’t there so you get it and all these medicine are there but as shown still you are just throwing the smallest peeble in the most intense darkness...Ash this isn’t pokmon mastery at all,it’s death mastery as that note itself said just wait till the moment,just don’t leave us man,water,grass,fire,dragon,special psychics..didn’t have rock and steel..and you know that happens if they do..if they call just give it to us and we’ll tell first to learn these then come and ask if we will ever be able to get these legally or not and then let us use these on 600 lightrope-Berneturs ourselves and then you will let them loose on the whole world..the authority has absolutely no idea where they are and whats just below them...”
Tracey(smile,shakes his head) : “you were talking about hells Ash,that’s enough for all lives...(Ash laughs and shakes his head)”
Gary(smile) : “indeed,grandpa said he never heard of yrtionmypjul before 3 years ago and had to learn said Xormnuh is barely even mentioned in texts only dead samples were tatsted except one 3 years ago instantly dided after that evolution and that stuff was it’s highest evolution..Xormnuh with around 10 suffix and 10 prefix(Ash laughs) was against Goodra with another whoose name i don’t want to mention cause its too big and then too evoluted(Ash shakes his head with smile).both among highest known physhcics may be each like 50  highest naturally evoluted darkened-Mewtwos,whom you know what they are via Team Rocket and that darkened type itself was only 5th or 6th degree naturally rest was swellen...first of all,they should get their undercovers in labs then come to us and give all the illegal elements then we’ll see the rest...just impossible it is Ash,when you and Misty met in Viridan lake to these...go back right there and forget the rest..”(Ash laugh,all smile)..
Ash(laugh) : “well,Gary you know we saw a Suicune,a Mewtow and a Mew,i saw a Hi-Ho these all in 5 years travel with Mist later may be 15 more or so,Zapdos,Raikou,Entei,Bryrock,Moltres,Camolplus and so on,but these 103 are something else entirely..all those we know the most seen 45..then we have another 90..then these come and these are just impossibly intelligent..out of total 272 listed they got all above first 135 barring only 38 each 18 types not the topmost two or three like ghost/psychics Xormnuh is 4th Hytostohurakanom is 5th(laugh)..i don’t think that these guys are going to stop till the legends are extinct,the name you didn’t mention,Hytostohurakanom(laugh)..with may be 500 prefix and sufix and type specifications...whoever gave that,name man,if you saw that with the swellen up stuff(laugh)...just never knew where they were after Goodra did his tricks with all sorts of counting as he always does...they never knew what to do once they knew who they were via Goodra but due to their intelligence tried to copy him still tried to battle,tried to phsyic me,tried to be friends with me,then their own masters,spoke something with Goodra tried to influence other groups,cried to me that they are unhappy..did all things imaginable to get rid of their confusion and charge and i at a point was thinking whether they will end or self destory like this..you know my Crawdauntogator took so many years to reach that being my pokemons if i got any of these two,at what level they can go with freedom and jovilaity,they’d just be human minus the emotions i guess(laugh),Hytostohurakanom whom Palkia saw mostly,Seserturnityp whom Nivy managed mostly and finally their absolute best Xormnuh who was against Goodra...and finally Crawdaunt was for other general types cause i didn’t want Crawdaunt to get involved in this cause his level may cause the legends to be so happy that they in that happiness may self destroy and thus all of us simply cause Crawdaunt has more experience and been with me more...Palkia and Crawdaunt got detached from me before the accidnet with all outside pokemons and Seserturnityp,Goodra became alone against Xormnuh and Hytostohurakanom as Nivy got busy with Capxexil who suddenly after getting dumbfound by Crawdaunt came back and was going nuts...then when i saw Xormnuh and Hytotohurakanom together working miracles especially telling me they aren’t happy exactly like Zekrom does that was scary cause i couldn’t be beaten unless i myself fumble and not due to my pokemons singular or plural and that was the trick to tell me let Goodra up so that they can jump him and i was just thingking that this duo would self destroy and they were so freedom loving that they may sarcifice even fun though they don’t understand the same thing appearing as variety...finally these two did go to that as those lunatics were trying to jump me and then i thought Goodra can’t take it anymore and Nivy was trying his best after his legend was trying to come back cause he was most swellend up and few other choised brats were there(laugh) but i thought i had to intervene more so i went all in to save Goodra then the lunatics tried to physically kill me compelling my and all others to go absolute and thus the accident...if it was the greatest boss he would’ve just politely budged there saying Goodra is too sweet to battle against...but man some duo that is..hopefully all did got back from pokecentres safe and healthy..but they will be abused tomorrow again...those two somehow was too confused in the end and finally was tamed but then of course the 3 pushed the self destruction buttion somehow all those legends were irritated to go all out when Goodra told them still that they weren’t playing properly and so on and then i get involved to save Goodra may be 40 seconds before and those buffoons go to there absolute lunacy having already jumped me both physically and mentally then physically they couldn’t do much cause they were knackered but did what they did with that final pshysic blast that all the pokemons present did and somehow their bodies couldn’t take and mine luckily survived with a permanent scar...yeah legend taming is something with negetiveity everywhere..once only experience really..but Gary all the trouble later was because i was hospitalized totally for 3 months and then i came out and they jumped my physical and mental limitations for that next one month to get me involved in everything,that is what no pokemons can do and that’s exactly what these buffoons needs to know and just do the illegal things more shrewdly and prudently...all of them did contact me and Trevor did appologize,i just brushed him aside saying it’s ok but it’s better just to be good professionals and the relationship ultimately is there so to be there and he obliged,then others well,Hoenn,Johto they just wished me saying they were sorry if they tried to accuse me and that’s it,Kanto is still againt me as usual,Unova just thanked me but wants me to get involved again next week so i just brushed them aside and the Orange of course,wants to fondle the water empress so much so the she again does their dirty works and i am still as usual the bait so just brushed them aside again..your husband is in Unova and grave danger due to the open ocean Telplocus’ why are you sitting at home so just jump into fire and they then accuses the husband(laugh)what a logic...if those dam brats went to the husband they would’ve been sent packing by that Bernetur alone beyond life(laugh)..anyway,Persy only has been real sorry and never doubted me and now is learing things but he said he has doubts whether he can continue long or not cause it doesn’t suit him and he i only saw was truely sorry for whatever happened to and with me and yeah,i forgive him everyday,he was honest no matter what he did and was so against the world for me from first to last...the only member in that panel held at Sewdel Islands to say it was wrong to drag Mist there knowing everything and he regretted if other hall of fames were just afraid of losing their positions and all except Nigel,Munro and Nancy exactly those who faced me in those 3 finals which is pretty obvious that they know my bunch well...but Persy has this idea that given all support i can really mentor these operations and no just mentoring he doesn’t want me to be physically present if i don’t want that myself..but my personal issues or Mist’s...nope,none seriously does consider that except Lance but he’s in Johto retired and all just doesn’t bother about the world anymore,that’s better these bunch of buffoons except Persy...but i told him that look you’re seeing for yourself just my best wishes but i’m not hearing one word about legends or operations unless it’s about me or my family cause 1-5 legends all we know how we can control and more than 5 legends you know you have failed in administration and you also know another team rocket isn’t happening cause their boss is saying so for the last 5 years and that’s all he also obliged and all...i never believed my sweet Mist would be pushed into fire just because i told them she’s my wife and that’s ok but not in that situation...and Telplocus’s brigade was exactly there a few days before the operations somehow both sets of buffons didn’t have the right balanced bonhomie(laugh)...and (laugh)..if you want to save your wife you may divorce heres a paper later marry again if you’re not guilty...(laugh,shakes head)...if Goodra was there they would’ve been marrying and divorcing each other now in cosmic darkness...then news comes they can’t save you unless this as this is only serious injury(burst into laughter) and this is known already leaked(laugh)..Dr Zyko was extremely angry with this and wanted to take it out of our profession to make sure Trevor and Persy both are under the law,i told him Persy alone stood against it and his own office backstabbed him let him go and Trevor no matter what he’s doing now saved my life for 9 continous months then helped me to get married with my soulmate whom i foolishly left for 4 years and wandered around like a vagabond he means a lot to me no matter what..so he budged and then of course Cynthia at Johto will be totally silent,Kanto in committie got their leeways and now Stuart is a beautiful man(laugh) later Trevor too when he was demoted and the new boss Jason(laugh) what a man..he cut all weeds off by not realizing a thing and Ivana at Hoenn was all over the place cause she thought i cheated throughout career and passed the termination proposal with Sinnoh not voting and all rest saying yes terminate and Orange with Wendy themselves created that fiasco Unova has now got the great Mark
..and Kalos was finally woken that they too are in this world which means get rid of all that is a toruble so backstabbed Persy..my bunch was inches away from termination and thus i told Goodra to stay very carefull and tell Nivy to be very alert then later Crawdaunt and Palkia too knew rest i couldn’t directly help but i knew the whole Oak Lab will erupt if Bulbasaur wants and still i had Muk with him as well and all those two labs in Unova would’ve been brunt out had the Magmorter bunch been there..i told Dr Zyko a week later after i knew he was good and he instantly told each day if Goodra isn’t brought FROUR TIMES for me to be assured that his psychic levels are ok then he will go outside profession and get the Unovan general governement involved...Persy was in tears really with it and i consoled him well before this Gary and all went there then i learnt the things and all but before i returned just the day before Trace went there with Cili,a brat from Kalos of all places told me that they were sorry but it’s between professional world only that about your injury and then said Mrs Waterflower Ketchum,did that Telplocus rescue operation is she alright with all steps we were forced to breach you private life cause we found no other way of vaildating your action...that brat was saved that day cause Nivy and Goodra were told i was out of danger and they could just return to lab it’s ok and Dr Zyko was away that day cause that instant i thought mate do you want us to send you in cosmic darkness immediately to see what else you can fetch from there for next life...i controlled my anger and said what are you implying to which he says,’it’s ok we’ll try to supress it later and only very few in profession know’,this incensed me more and i called in the attendents and said i see,so your moment must’ve been recorded for people to...um..sorry...sorry..very sorry..just came..off..um..”
Daisy(smile) : “it’s alright Ash,don’t bother and we should change the topic if you feel uncomfortable.”
Ash(smile): “no Daisy it’s alright very sorry just came off..anyway Trace what about the Ghostradarkarrigussonor that got away from my beloved Xormnuh and 2 other legend’s clutch cause the master’s got too greedy forgot a step in apparatus(laugh)..and that lure machine they had to get legends..man(laugh)..man if that brat was there too(laugh)...heard that new right,what if that brat comes comes around again tomorrow(laugh)..what i told Mist about Ghostradarkarrigus was pretty much close to truth for Xormnuh hismself and he is may be 5 levels below..that brat would’ve used dark hallucinations of some unknown kind to test my tickling skills for an hour(laugh)...Gary,Trace how the hell they made that lure machine and the Elite4 head didn’t care neither the labs..what chance do we have that from that 100 more won’t be there?...and they charged you of all for supplying materials cause of me..(laugh)..”
Gary(smile) : “yeah,just that but i tell you Ash,if i get to know now that any such idiot is doing i’ll join him and try to sabotage him to set Ghostradarkarrigussonor upon them with your bunch to fondle the whole world themselves(Ash laugh)...told grandpa about lure machine gradpa of all people fell off from his seat saying first trial and success and those brats work for those idiots where was Elite4 at all..and Brock i guess you can’t treat anyone above Xormnuh...”
Brock(smile) : “that’s absolutely right Gary(laugh)..we would’ve ourselves killed the brat off to study his anatomy(Ash and Gary laugh others smils and shakes their heads)”
Tracey(smile) : “well,i’m so happy ever that i can atleast draw well for a living(Ash and other few laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “ayway,lets laugh things off,this is from Hoenn Elite4 party,a semi-male full-dumped brat got me to mentor him and his obvious type advantaged girlfriend(all laugh) they were just getting started and was from another outside out profession stuff were 26/27 wanted to do 2 journeys too much money had to spend the stuff(all laugh),’um..Mr Ketchum excuse me but..’,’sir(all laugh)..please sir it hurts me sir to be honoured so much(all burst into laughter)...sir how may i serve you..totally gets confused cause saw what i did in media(all laugh)...’,’um no Mr Ketchum,we were..says what they want a bit..so Mr Ketchum we were just asking for starters..’,’sir,you know that my starter is on my shoulders now why don’t you have a look(all laugh)?...’ the brat is too shocked cause you know Chu was sparking(all laugh) then the girlfriend shows the courage of the bias(all laugh)...’yeah,Mr Ketchum i’ll see how your Pikachu is..’..Chu as you know wanted to play,first doesn’t want to go then straight jumps on the girl and bits her nose hard(all laugh)..before she could react,goes on the male brats head and totally messes up his hair(all laugh),return to the shocked girlfriend to scratch the same spot(all burst into laughter) and finally messes up the male brat’s dress too by so very lightly thunderbolting the brat(all laugh)...now the male brat is flattened on the ground with dress and all totally messed up(all laugh) and in pretty much pain(all luagh) and female brat is in real pain and can’t say a thing cause they started it and finally Chu with that sweet innocent face goes to the female brat again bits the same spot(all burst into laughter) and sweetly says ‘Pik-a-chu’(all burst into laughter)..that’s thanks for your time(all laugh)...and then i say,’see sir,with kids it’s hard to be in peace(all burst into laughter) so why don’t you trek less travel more?(all laugh)’...the whole place is shocked and all professionals were dying from laughter...what a night...but still i can never forget that,what a night this comrads Cerulian(all laugh)...’you’ve abducted all’,’sisters or show’(all burst into laughter),’whoose your fiancee’,’sir only if i get the ring then..’(all laugh)...what a night,anyway,my flower needs to Mist down and Misty up now(all laugh)...so we’ll go back to the one and only Anabel Angela(all laugh),water gym of all(all laugh),Grystropper City,Johto,5 years in hall of fame as well(all laugh)...that was my 2nd gym there as i said after getting Feraligator as second there that too after Heracross as first(all laugh) and what days all those 3 were(all laugh)...Brock it’s all yours man(all laugh)..’
Brock(laugh) : “well the then dumped female brat(all laugh) was 22 i guess,started at 19 but was extremely good then already as you know now in hall of fame not much behind you Misty(all laugh)...in the hellrounds now just a breather(all burst into laughter)...”
Misty(smile,hugging Ash very firmly) : “my Ash is only me(all smile).”
Ash(laugh,tendering Misty) : “too naive(all laugh)...first sees me wants to propose(all laugh)...registered and all then before gym battle meeting sits absolutely beside me(all laugh)...now Brock your interpretations(all laugh)...”
Brock(laugh) : “her mom takes us aside first away(all laugh)...’um..’mam my Ash..um..my friend(all laugh) needs um..guidence(all laugh)...obviously Mrs Angela realizes what is what(all laugh),then i’m eaten up..’cries..hmm..WHAT IS THAT NAMECALL DOING WITH MY ASH..um..’(all laugh)...’Misty,please,you know him,he’s eating her up by now(all laugh)’..’what was that Brock,huh?..you mean he..he...HOW CAN YOU SAY MY ASH WANTS..um..”(all laugh)...’Misty,please,there are 10000 people there in the meeting including referees(all laugh),just calm down’..sobs..’no he doesn’t like me(all laugh)...but that,that I’LL SHOW YOU YOU NAMECALL(all laugh)...’ anyway Ash returns,’yeah good meeting,nice girl(all burst into laughter)’..’hum..too sweet wasn’t it..nice girl..nice(all laugh)..GET READY TO ERASE HER OFF(all laugh)..PIKACHU SHOW THAT NAMECALL THAT...(all laugh)’...then Ash tells her,’yeah getting ready,but Mist,this is a water pokemon gym too are you relatives(all burst into laughter)..’,’NEVER(all laugh)..that..that..get ready..you..’..goes away then...then finally Ash wins it then Anabel sees whole time all of Misty’s antics(all laugh)...and those were something for sure(all laugh)...beside Ash all the time almost when he’s practising and you know the art of observation if Misty is alone(all laugh)...then during practise ever namecalling him(all laugh) but as soon as he sits down he’s her best friend(all laugh)...but in the gym it was a totally different stuff(all laugh)first the whole time before the match will tell him he’s her best friend but once he’s in,if he is down namecalling him all the time cause he’s being petulant(all laugh) and when he is confident go absolutely mad namecalling him that everything was wrong that now he’s being impetuous(all laugh)...since that 3rd gym battle same characteristics only after returning did she become the regular friend during match(all laugh)..and all saw this stuff(all laugh) and knew the aged wife stuff(all laugh)...but Ash those 2 stories in Orange is only right for you to say(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh,hugging Misty firmly and Misty frowns at Ash,hugging Ash firmly,Ash laughs even more) : “well my Mist bug is scowling now(all cheer for Misty,Misty too laugh finally,all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh,fake anger) : “what was that Brock,huh?(all laugh)..(fake sob)..YOU WANT US TO GET RECONCILED(all laugh)..Brock how could you become a lawyer....(all including Misty burst into laughter)...and Trace,SNORLAX(all laugh)...”

Tracey(laugh) : “Ash i only am so greatfull that you weren’t eloquent then(all laugh)..all of us including your flower as well would’ve been minutely taught on anatomy(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “well my bee is ever too interested to spoil me(all laugh) so that i can see the sweats in him(all laugh) so..too cold(all laugh)...Trace,Scyther(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “yeah we’ve got to deal then(all laugh)...anyway Ash says like as he did why doesn’t his flower hold his hands for one more minute after 24 hours(all laugh) and then i tell him that his flower and that brat himself as well are playing jealousy tricks to get trap their beaus so they are in meeting without their best friends(all laugh)...’um..yeah like after this battle that brat will tell his best friend that she is indeed his best friend(all burst into laughter)...i see..but Trace,Mist and i are best friends so why this endeavour to strenghten it more?(all burst into laughter)’..’get prepared for the match Misty already had her and won thus so should you’..’yeah i saw the match too but it’s great that she won but as she used if i were she,then a Corsola vs Charizard in 17 minute 6 round 5 down..(all laugh)..’..so i fled the scene(all laugh) anyway Misty meets us again and Ash is not there now so meets me 1st thing so excited,’Trace!Trace! what did he say(all laugh)’,’if he was you and used your Corsola then he would’ve lost to his Chazrizard(all laugh)’..’hum..that..that namecall(all laugh)..screams..hey you namecall...(all laugh)’..and then forgets everything and namecalls him and i saw Rudy was laughing looking at this scene and that incensed both our halves even more(all laugh)...so anyway after match Ash gets the badge and and all then later tells his flower a nasty thing(all laugh),’i see Mist,then unless i say you’re my best friend everyday(all laugh)’...now our flower is so dejected(all laugh) then the customery hand holding and i’m totally forgotten(all laugh)...that was the last attempt at jealousy(all laugh)...but Misty sadly for you your vulture killer is too dense(all laugh)...Melody,Anabel..so sweet...cute....(all burst into laughter)..”
Misty(frown,hugging Ash very firmly,Ash laughs and tenders her) : “SHUT UP!(all laugh and cheer for Misty)..”
Ash(laugh,tendering Misty,Misty is resting her head on Ash’s shoulder hugging him firmly) : “too naive(all laugh)..always like this any girl wants to talk with me,’why are you looking at her Ash(all laugh)’...and this was the exact trouble at Unova too fond of her hubby(hugs Misty very firmly,Misty smiles and same pose,all smile)..anyway,Crook(all laugh)..lets go back to Anabel(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “indeed Ash’s jelousey story is,’hi,Mist’(all laugh)...too naive(all laugh)...but about that saying everyday i got the full wrath for asking him that(all laugh)...so Ash wins the match and returns and then Misty as usual namecalls everyone whlie Ash does the better friend confession(all laugh) and then as you know and why Misty herself is in hall of fame herself as soon as Ash finishes she’ll get her 2 on 2 time limit 10 and then does that Anabel narrowly beat her but complimented her as well...now during the match and this is now Ash observing(all laugh)...very few words spoken unless a new attack that i have to tell him even if i don’t know a thing(all laugh) or cheering up at all(all laugh)..win/lose Misty comes back may be angry,’Mist,emotion isn’t good right(all burst into laughter)’..then of course that means,’my Ash doesn’t like me’(all laugh) and then that is all about better friendly proximity(all laugh)..anyway,during this match Ash says while observing his flower(all laugh),’Brock,isn’t Anabel Mist(all laugh uncontrollably)...’..i was in afterlife already(all laugh)...that’s the first time he infact said that 4/5 months into Johto and since then started to hug his flower back(all laugh) again as you know due to MY confirmation(all burst into laughter)..asks for permissions(all laugh)..naively(all laugh)..’Ash,what are you..’,’no Anabel was sitting too close to me before like Mist(all laugh)..and then talking like Mist(all laugh)..but she doesn’t have the presence that Mist has(all burst into laughter)..and didn’t look like her(all burst into laughter)..then i thought water gym may be relative(all laugh) and you too went away easily with Mrs Angela Mist must’ve told her to do these before(all laugh uncontrollably)..’..’Ash,that girl had a crush on you and Misty madly cherishes you(all burst into laughter)..do you understand anything(all laugh)..’..’um..yeah like Anabel is a Chikorita but Mist is a Meganium(all uncontrollably laugh),thus all else who behaves like a best friend(all burst into laughter) is actually only a lower version of Mist isn’t it(all laugh)?’,’just see the match(all laugh).’...then the match probably took about 11 minutes and went till that very end of 12 given minutes to finish but just before the finish,’Brock,so because these copies thinks i’m their good friends Mist then must think that i’m her best friend right(all burst into laughter)?..’,’boy(all burst into laughter)’..’yeah boy best friend like she’s my girl best friend(all uncontrollalbly laugh)..thus she is different to all(all laugh)..is but Mist only looks like a girl but not so(all burst into laughter)..best friend yeah i understand(all laugh)..very best friend best(all laugh) thanks Brock anyway just emotions Onix vs Squirtle 2nd round 3rd minute 2nd takedown locked(all burst into laughter)..’..i said yeah thank relieved to battle(all laugh)..yeah cherish for anyone else Ash will realize and loath(all laugh) cause ‘but what if they are like fourth cousins(all uncontrollably laugh)’ and thus Misty can’t be realted to him so nothing more than better friend(all laugh)...and you now understand what he is talking about..Gary that quote(all laugh)..’
Gary(laugh) : “15 year old Ashey-boy(all laugh)...Ford was there he was 18 then,returned from his journey in Kanto...’Ash,come on talk with the girls more(all laugh)’..’um it’s alright i have spoken but um..why bother much(all laugh)’...others were waiting(all laugh)...’Ashy-boy can’t make a girlfrind(all burst into laughter)’...then now as girls were also about to join the party(all laugh)..and he had 3 friedns who were girls out of 30 may be(all laugh) cause rest all realized how dense a brat this is(all laugh)...now before those 3 can join Ashey-boy scoffs at Ford,’hmm..first journey already 500 girlfriends(all laugh)...’,’get a half first(all burst into laughter)’...well did that exactly(all laugh)...Ford has some contacts with me and still says halved at first sight(all laugh)...anyway,then Ashey-boy 15 year old took 20 more to become eloquent(all laugh)..then retorts .ly and then goes to somewhere else from where he has to be cajoled in again or he’ll Muk grandpa at midnight(all burst into laughter)...so before going Ashy-boy shouts,’yeah,girl boy,boy girl(all burst into laughter)..WHATS THE POINT IF THE DIFFERENCE PERSISTS(all burst into laughter and .)..’ and goes off but the those who heard are totally bemused(all laugh) we all were teenagers and all and Trivy was 19 oldest(all laugh)..he says,’Gary,did you pester him too much(all laugh)’ and Ford finally says out of his surprize that it means like he thinks that to know about girls he should’ve had a sister(all burst into laughter)...which again came true as well(all laugh)...unless his sis came around just after that,even two 2 words wouldn’t have been said(all laugh)...’

Daisy(laugh) : “i was told in colourful language and with complimentary antics that my Starmie was way inferior to even her Staryu whom she got the year before(all laugh) and she was 13 me 20(all laugh) and didn’t know one attack except watergun for all that she memorized and was trying to battle everyone(all laugh)..exactly opposite to Ash,who was about learing the art and about pokemons first more than battling then evolved into battle master by metally questioning(all laugh)..Mist started as battle master and went to the art later(all laugh)..and yeah about universality my man was opposite to me in terms of fondling too much then(all laugh) cause i atleast have ever been able to battle good or bad despite fondling my bunch too much(all laugh) but he first day came in and scoffed like,’how does one engage in such an INHUMAN activity(all laugh)’..anyway,my little baby tells me this and the worst thing is that i was told this right after returning from a hard match that i lost with Starmie(all laugh)..so i chide her and set Seal upon her(all laugh)..who fondles both her and Staryu to her absolute irritaion but then the little pest comes back to me to know how to battle a pokemon all by herself(all laugh) cause her Staryu misbehaved(all laugh)...and that was like the start for her to trust her sisters that they will not pester her(all laugh)...then later asked me like how should her dream boy be(all burst into laughter)...but yeah fished the once ever Ashey-boy(all laugh)...too Crwadauntogated(all laugh)...yeah,those too(all laugh)...absolute brats these are including the master brat(all laugh)..”

Lillie(laugh) : “yeah first you leave was unhappy for 2 days and so then we were telling her to get in the show finally got in cause now she was secured with marriage(all laugh)..yeah ever told us that i’m Mist Ketchum(all laugh) just can’t use that name officially then instant hit in a huge proportion and all but ever came back and was always that if you said stop the show immediately would stop it and you were the opposite never would force yourself upon her and thus i guess when both of you were under pressure it was hard just but then(all laugh)..no really Ash whatever you were then and thus the play this version of bifuted-Ghostradarkarrigussonor(all laugh) this is something else...”
Brock(laugh) : “Anabel is alive still though with ears and hairs intact(all laugh)...so to Ash i’ve confirmed that any girl is Misty(all laugh)..so now he can hug his flower back too else just fourth cousin(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “right,Anabel Angel faced me during Johto Elite4(all laugh)..and first i used..um..Chanedlure(all burst into laughter) the whole world gets to to know each different types of fire and how to NOT suppliment them with dark attacks cause all attacks must be absolutely pure which is that you must purify then only give her the process(all laugh) then she’ll assist you further(all laugh) and finally when your attack is refined 10 years later(all laugh)..she’ll say attacking is all about not misbehaving(all laugh) cause otherwise pokemons never attack(all laugh) so even that can’t be done unless she attacks her own behavioural demons(all laugh)...then will just show you how one must behave properly with youreself(all laugh) to attack the mental demons,DISCIPLINE(all laugh)...this will take 20 years(all laugh)...exactly what that brat did to Jubitarymol(all laugh)...finally the legend asked like are are you even sane(all laugh)...see sanity is also an attack so(all laugh)...legend realized this buffoon is only here to play and went off happily...anyway,Anabel Angela asks me post match despite my usual custom just after i came to Johto to never ask me personal questions(all laugh) many budged but of coure Anabel won’t(all laugh)..,’um..Ash..Cerulian(all burst into laughter)..’,’no i have no contacts with Cerulian City gym at all(all laugh) only know that they are in hall of fame and that’s all,please let us talk about Suicunes(all laugh)..’,realized my mood was off(all laugh)...well lets now bug back to Gyarados talks(all laugh)”
Misty(laugh) : “right,Gyarados rage was also double-
edged(all laugh)...anyway,but from this point
on,the moment he sees me holds my hand too
sweetly but this was his real mastery that the
shake hand period was stretched just that bit
enough to tell me his longing and this happened
every time in hugs or patting or the hand on the
shoulder,just enough to tell me what he was
thinking,and well i was more responsible then(all
laugh) so i couldn't show it but he was making me
too Gyaradosed up inside(all laugh) and when
alone that's standing or sitting just that bit
closer(all laugh and .)...it was his longing
presented with his natural character but i thank God
that my Pallet bee(all laugh) then hadn't explicitly beed
the Kalos Wisdom(all laugh)...otherwise Gyarados'
anatomy would've been eloquently compared with
mine(all laugh)...and speaking of anatomy,my bee many times told me in his heinous
eloquent self that if i wanted he'll help me to understand that how he himself was made of you-
know-what(all burst into laughter)),this is his eloquent filter of
hellrounds and this was just about 10 minutes into
our first night(all laugh uncontrollably)...too sweet,anyway(laugh,all laughs)...oh,yes i can never forget this one no matter how much plight i was in during hellrounds talks about me not liking it if there’s a girl that wants to talk to him which is...only me(all laugh)...so now if i talk with people(all laugh),no trouble TILL they shake my hands(all burst into laughter)...that is you know any unmarried male or female version(all laugh)..now asks me about each challenger and all else or even the inspectors(all burst into laughter) in this tone,’Mist,did they call you ‘mam(all burst into laughter)..’...of course shake hand is not allowed for boys(all laugh) unless i want to do it myself(all laugh)..tried to make sure that i only battle and all else i have to say and do is done by Sarah and Victor(all laugh)...oh yes,Hana gets every sort of shielding now to her utter irritation(all burst into laughter)..if any of the reviwers come an invisible ghost is ever there at half feet breach(all laugh)..and Victor is taught the WAYS(all laugh)..cause it’s only 4 years 5 minimum(all laugh)..first day straight asked Victor that i know what happened for a long time here and you also have to go to many place,both of you,i’ve many psychic and dark types(all laugh) atleast two will be around me most of the time(all laugh)..i can make it 6(all laugh) so do you two need any invisible wall(all burst into laughter)...Victor laughed the whole day(all laugh)...now it’s a mandate(all laugh)...Chu will jump on my shoulder once i come down from the platform(all laugh)..after Chu just came in he didn’t understand my mental signs at all except just a few which is so inceridble itself but then you know(all laugh)..all have been taught minutely for 6 years since late Unova how the breach of half feet with uneasiness means danger(all laugh)..so each time i went to any office or doctor(all laugh) you know i had to take Sarah or Brauch with me(all laugh) cause they were directed as TRUSTWORTHY(all laugh)...and if they weren’t would sweetly jump onto the offender sparking(all laugh)...and now Chu realizes almost all of the stuffs about me so more dnger(all laugh)...by the way now below 26 are spared mostly(all burst into laughter),26-28 very suspicious(all laugh) above 28,thunder-chair(all laugh) this is first human filter(all laugh) at Challenger centre(all laugh)..then anyone in before me Chu greets them(all laugh)..this is second..then Chu suspiciously looks at them sparking if i shake their hands(all laugh)..oh yeah this only my bee and his bunch can do,while hand shake a minimum time and distance(all laugh) is also specified with uneasiness(all laugh)..every morning Chu and the ghosts are minutely taught with helpers(all laugh)..breach that get your nose scratched and bit off(all laugh)..and a specified time is granted after and before match(all laugh),unless my wish that must be followed(all laugh)..and you all know how good they can differentiate between men and women this was taught to all via travel companion cards throughout for 19 years without their knowledge(all laugh)..the method was to try to differentiate his signals each time he spoke to them he would tell them that this is not male(all laugh)..then in Unova he had the battle hungry brat beau finding Tyranitar leading Crawdauntogator feeding bunch(all laugh) who themselves askes whoose that brat(all laugh) then he ever had 20 ghosts around(all laugh) then by means of psychic channels and all they themselves asked isn’t that a not male(all laugh)..then that knowledge was shared here at the lab amoung the bunch which has been there practise ground with Trace and Gary and their soulmates(all laugh) for 20 years now and now additionally Brock and Viol is here too for 1.5(all laugh)..i was never told(all laugh)..thus they don’t understand a thing and thus Chu was told to just alter his knowledge(all laugh)...my(all smile) sweet hubby(all smile),so,Chu most cause he was shown my picture everyday at night(all laugh)..but if i say this guy or girl is good prize is a cap and if they want anyone’s sign we do that but my sign alone is strictly forbidden for unmarried guys above 26 (all burst into laughter) and for married people and all else in last region 5/6 leagues(all laugh) there’s that supplimentary note of gratitude for visiting(all laugh) and yes married people can have only my autograph alone(all laugh)...he has few signed always if he’s absent and so on but anyway if they get a cap or something they will be given specially prepared poems on certain things as well which you saw(all smile and laugh) but also heinously Gengleye(all burst into laughter)..if he is present that will go on(all laugh)..and all gets caps and peoms including travel companions...and all stuffs are told to not USE the reservation(all laugh) but another place himself pointed them out(all burst into laughter) cause says,’just the emotion(all laugh),no good if suppressed ONLY AND ONLY IF PORPER(all laugh)..we didn’t(all laugh) and Nivy ever says just that blooming youth(all burst into laughter)’...reservation was guarded by Gengeleye(all laugh)..you know what happens if they are around during the moments(all burst into laughter)...so all are off unless it’s specified people(all laugh)...and that is except us and you all and the eventual 4 though(all burst into laughter) but yeah family tradition wise(all laugh)..but that protection was good now Garchomp and Dialga(all laugh)...God save the offenders(all laugh)...i went there Garchomp via Chu asks,’um...do you know reflections(all laugh)’...i immediately fled the scene cause he also had his tester of reflections comrade Latios around him(all laugh)...and Dialga(all laugh)..he would say can you advise me what this moment means for me(all laugh)...anyway,now my bee says during hellrounds that there are 1000 ways to shake someones hand out of which 999 are ulterior(all burst into laughter)...he only stepped out of his house knowing each of these precisely(all burst into laughter)...then came back from Unova first thing was trying to learn if anyone shook my hands in not only 1 way(all laugh)..that’s my hubby 1001(all laugh)...6 feet circle is mandatory(all laugh)..also i was enquired on whether Trace while managing my emotions ever broke 10 ft or not(all laugh)...and i was hugged to death to tell him if we were suppressing any mistreatment against us by anyone(all laugh) then whole ghost gang will be set upon on them at any uncertain night(all laugh)..and i can do anything with the rules except the circles(all laugh)..cause so cunningly it’s told to the pokemons(all laugh)..and yeah Starmie and Starew knows these extremely well as well cause they have to get through these whole night with the ghosts(all burst into laughter)..and you know it’s just for all sorts of battles as well with distance attack variations(all laugh and .)..and if i once say that why so much protection whole Kalos wisdom will be shown(all laugh)..how many ways are there shield the ulterior(all laugh) and i am so afraid to get these potections over cause then everyday anatomy classes will start(all laugh),in built protection(all laugh)..and the way is extremely wicked(all laugh)..he will not allow me to hug him and then keep telling me why to him i’m separted form all of my own body and mind thus don’t need to touch him(all laugh),then his own anatomy will be shown by means of decreasing our age to 1(all burst into laughter) and i have to see that and can’t hug him that how it’s all about blood and sweat(all laugh)..and this is most heinous cause each time i will be told how many times he hugged me during training and all with sweat(all burst into laughter)..then hold my hands and say how much germs they have and all the blood and sweat(all laugh)..now finally if i threaten him that i’ll cry now(all laugh) then he will fondle my hairs(all laugh) and finally hug me(all laugh) and while he is hugging me says keep checking my motives(all burst into laughter) as he will continute to profusely speak(all laugh) about how he has always been infatuated with me cause he took all cares of me(all laugh) and his way to do this is as you know will continue to say all beause i was less dark and only once in that first moment touched him by slapping(all burst into laughter) and yes all 21 year long handshakes and hugs all were with ill intent actually(all laugh) and how everytime he touched me means it was all about that he was cheating on my friendship(all laugh) and the whole reason i cherish him is because he tricked me with a mask that he is not(all laugh)..yeah still does this saying how he is with this very talk is deceiving me to like the hug(all burst into laughter) and from day one it will be shown how everyone else has been true friends and all except him(all laugh) and finally if all weren’t enough it will be shown how i truely longed for but whit this long hug itself he has shown that he is only here for flesh and blood(all laugh) and will break the hug and try to go out of room unless i smack him(all laugh) and all this is so that i get to understand whether or not my husband is being ulterior with me(all burst into laughter)...sweet hubby(laugh,all laugh)...but previously after all the Unova it was most heinous cause mom were told couple of times how he doesn’t cherish me as much as i do(all laugh)..mom was shocked first day(all laugh) and you know what was the situation after the first month we came here and thus mom asked me what has he done(all laugh)...by then i realized my how sweetened my bee has become...so(all laugh,laugh) i just laughed then an told mom that on the previous day how he had to take a call at bed time and thus couldn’t reciprocate when i said night cause he had to go outside of the room so that i don’t get disturbed as i was tired but when he returned after 2 minutes i still was awake cause i forgot to tell him something this was the fact that i was waiting despite wanting to sleep but he didn’t cut the idiot who called who had a urgent thing thus called and took 2 minutes out of which 60 seconds was apology(all laugh) and he was none other than Cecil(all laugh)..and still he was 2 minutes late but i was ok still said what i had to say but on the next morning he hugged me more than necessary(all laugh) and forgot to tell me something that he did 10 minutes later(all laugh) but this means i waited for my husband to comeback before sleep for two minutes to tell him only to fondle my hairs so that i can sleep better(all laugh) but if my husband hugs me for 2 more minutes it means he only wants my hair and not me(all burst into laughter)...mom was scared to hear this(all laugh),said what did that Gengar do(all burst into laughter)...then next time it was that i had to call him twice as he was unmindfull as he was writing reports on reservation instruments(all laugh) to say food was ready(all laugh) but i wasn’t late for 1 second to reciprocate cause previously he called me for rechecking the break list he made for me so that i can fool around( without any trouble(all laugh) and to this call i reciprocated without any delay as i was joking with Sally(all laugh)...this means he’s here only for my pokemons and not me(all burst into laughter)...this time mom scoffed him saying he’s must be alert and not disturb my conversations cause the gym was mine not his(all burst into laughter)...mom you know would later say that is Ash behaving well(all burst into laughter)..i laughed for an hour(all laugh)..then i told mom all is because i didn’t agree with him that a certain report must not be written too sternly(all laugh) and was a bit firm with him all the while he stood like my servant(all laugh) and pleaded me go easy as my vocal cords were being strained(all burst into laughter) this is his way to force me to express my request to the main inspector to grant us more time to prepare the newborns enough so that they pass the fitness test cause we were ourselves neglecting that(all laugh) this had to be written in a colourful language(all laugh) threatening them with hosting Berneturs(all laugh) so that it shows who should serve whom(all laugh)..it was to be written that unless the time is granted we wont take any responsibity if a challenger is not given a badge cause he couldn’t handle a bit of chiding(all burst into laughter) after match cause he couldn’t handle Jellicent’s blitz zapping againt him not his pokemon(all laugh) and if she can’t handle her sentiments on being pointed out that when Gyarados was charging not at the pokemon but at the platform at full force(all burst into laughter) so that the pokemon panicks even more as the master fumbles(all laugh) then rather than staying UNEMOTIONAL(all laugh) she stuttered a bit(all burst into laughter)..and each day exactly these two methods are being minutely taught to them(all burst into laughter)..the zapping is obvious(all laugh) and Sableye teaches Gyarados how to fondle the challenger pokemon after each attack verbally(all laugh) to lull her into comfort and thus slyly distracting her charge with full rage at her master(all burst into laughter)..and my Gyarados of all pokemons loves this too much(all laugh and .)..already a poor kid cried her head off(all laugh)..yeah the Gyarados ball was Crawdauntogated(all laugh) and my Dosey sweetie first time in her life disobeyed me making a face saying i’m trying to recall her cause i don’t like her as a best friend(all burst into laughter .ping) cause i prefer her beau(all burst into laughter,.)...right(laugh,all laugh), and Jelicent was even happier obviously due to ghostly bonhomie(all laugh),actually for the first time in my life a gym pokemon scoffed at me(all burst into laughter) cause i wasn’t telling him to use the zap which he himself used(all laugh)..my hubby has spoiled my buch enough to get them to totally reject the responsibility mask after 0 minutes(all laugh) and i now thus am forced to leave all official works upon my hubby(all laugh) for the exact reason(all laugh) and pass almost the whole time with my bunch otherwise none will not battle at all(all laugh) and i still have to allow them these indisciplines which are taught as soon i go away(all laugh) else they will invite Gengar during match(all laugh) while Sableye makes sure Dewgong and Chu are too busy with ethical negotiations while the others misbehaves to maximum making several factions and cajoling one gurdian one love them and the other to do the opposite(all laugh) and Gengar thus has to PROTECT me(all laugh)...this(all laugh,laugh) was planned by my sweet bee to scare challengers(all laugh) as Gengar will suddenly appear through me(all burst into laughter) to hallucinate them Chanedlure herd charging while i was 12 feet tall and he was maniacly laughing(all burst into laughter) already tested twice(all laugh) i had to brosist the gentlemen(all laugh) who were respectively 3 league and 2 league champions above 28(all laugh) cause they asked how can my Gengar be so frivolus(all burst into laughter)..and the referees that’s Hana,Victor,Sally and Foyth(all laugh) are threatened with insomnia(all laugh) that if a challenger goes down before one minute(all laugh) ask for the additional 10 seconds so that my bunch as taught will run out of sanity after 10(all laugh).. and all this is to make sure i’m just like the 16 year old while still being the gym leader with my bunch and my bee(all smile)...sweet(all smile) bee,but too eloquent(all laugh)...right(all laugh),so mom was laughing saying this little pest is extremely wicked(all laugh) he will quarrel in a way that makes him look most romantic(all laugh)...then mom told me to use same tactics(all laugh)...then i tried that(all laugh) which was the greatest mistake of my life(all laugh)...Gengleye fondled me for 1 hour after closing(all laugh)..then comes in and says,’Mist,i realize your concern,see my bunch if i don’t chide them disturb even you(all laugh) and actually i was mistaken you must’ve not liked it that i touched you while i was sweating in reservation(All laugh)..see i actually only am here because(all laugh) ’... this is at night before that didn’t see me earlier cause he has to make sure that i think he is the one who cherishes me less(all laugh)..so came in at night like he has done a huge crime(all laugh)...so later i’m told if a say not even comparing but just convey the meaning that my husband cherishes me in any different language to mom at a time when i want to be with him 24/7 cause he was away for so long but if i say it it will mean i’m only out of my own yearning saying it to VEIL(all laugh) the ulterior(all laugh)...and even most dangerously i once conveyed the sentiment in just general discussion that we cherish each other so much but as luck may have it he has to stay away from me all the time and he can’t come to live with me despite him so much wanting to cause of so many hazards,comes in,’um..Mist,you say you cherish me..um..did i do someting wrong(all burst into laughter)’,then i scoffed at him then his apology for straining my vocal cords(all laugh) is,’but when i was against those legends i did forget my ring(all laugh)...’ this was hellrounds as well,he broke-up and went to undercover but was very happy that wasn’t around me and was in that hell(all laugh) but i didn’t call him back via Lance and all after undercover when the whole world knew his whereabouts(all laugh) yet was unhappy that he wasn’t with me means i can’t say i cherish my husband cause that will belittle my yearning for my husband(all laugh) nor can i say my husband cherishes me cause my husband is with me being ulterior all along(all burst into laughter)...i must say that my husband looks after me and i’m very happy with his services(all laugh)...right(all laugh),so please i said all this cause my hubby bee has also spoiled his brothers and sister-in-laws(alll laugh)...”
Daisy(laugh) : “Trace was minutely taught how to marry me again and again(all burst into laughter) and this was hours after that late night discourse(all laugh)...now Trace has been told to mix my bunch with the Crawdauntogator(all laugh)..so they will misbehave and irritate me to the extreme and then my main colleagues here will judge least pokemons themselves and thus when i go i will face most pestering guided by the most dreaded philosopher the age realtion lecturer(all laugh),who along with all goes to the committe of CrawdauntogatorTyphlosionler and reviewed by Yveltal(all laugh) to know whoose turn is it today to pester whom(all burst into laughter) which then must be confirmed by Bulbasaur and Infernape as to if the subjects are ok for the torture or not(all burst into laughter)..and Confragigus and Hoopa together Conhoopa(all laugh) of all dark ghost psychic duos(all laugh)..what an introduction to life(all laugh) they will be set upon my little dolls(all laugh)..so that they are very happy but each time they sleep i will be pestered to death as to why i’m not behaving like my dolls(all burst into laughter),this plan is to get Daisy to become DaisyDevil(all laugh) cause the devil section(all laugh) is the VEIL to drive the jackal away(all laugh uncontrollably)..now if the veil is pointed out devil will become Daisy and herself will run after the jackal(all laugh uncontrollably) now look at the logic(all laugh)
Trace is told that he is ever gentle but as he never could express his wishes properly cause he was afraid to hurt his parents and brother and then when he had to be firm he was mistaken and thus was rather made a realation to them than son and brother and then he found his family back at the Oak Lab and all but that previous pungence made him to be even more gentle here cause he didn’t want to lose this life...and he also here was gentle cause to him personal life and professional is complimentary and thus not much difference so if his personal life is distrubed he can’t work and the viseversa all in all he’s too gentle thus he’s repeatedly told that he’s a fox(laugh) so that he jackals up(all laugh) like he did whenever Orange boy wanted to fondle his toffee-flower alone(all laugh) so Trace in illusion forgot that he’s a jackal(all burst into laughter) and became a Mr Skechit(all burst into laughter)..Now,Daisy is ever gentle as well but because she has had to look after her 3 sisters and that namecalled gym(all laugh) suddenly with virtually zero help and with the most devastating personal loss at that age and then the huge responsibility from the age of 18/19 she was rather thrown into the bay without any signals or preparations by luck and if that wasn’t good enough there was the infamous Cerulian wisdom mask(all laugh) which told her to throw her sentiments left and right(all laugh) to veil her gentleness(all laugh) but she deluded herself in thinking that the sentimental side was always important no matter whom and what situation and thus neglected the gentleness so Daisy transformed into DaisyDaisyl(all burst into laughter)...
so the situation was that the concerned Mr Tracey Skechit had to fox his fear of sentimental outbursts(all laugh) cause he was only being honest to himself nothing else and become a Mr jackal(all laugh) and DaivyDaisyl(all laugh) had to..really what a double-formed multiple edged nickname(all laugh)...so she had to devil down and Daisy up cause she in illusion equated her own gentleness with sentimental outbursts and thus was irritated by the jackal cause he wasn’t doing so(all laugh)...
so thus after whole day of work the jackal is told to mingle with the law section(all laugh) and every other little trouble possible(all laugh) and if there weren’t any then himself to create them(all burst into laughter) and then sentimentally show Daisy how he wants to work like a gentleman but can’t anywhere as outside so much trouble and now his Dase flower too was being devillish(all laugh) and thus being shown then Daisy will confess her longing herself too sweetly(all laugh and .) and this is straight from the confession plan(all burst into laughter)...which Trace was told how he cried and i seeing that exact moment automatically deviled down and Daisyed up(all laugh uncontrollably)..then he was told exactly when i myself cried(all laugh)..how the jackal screamed for the first time in 20 years..(all laugh)..and how the door was closed by Sarah(all burst into laughter)..how Sarah and Brauch didn’t understand any of the sisters properly cause they were too naive(all laugh) in affection and the devil infact made them think that she actually is being only Daisy(All burst into laughter)...and in last month itself Trace tricked me four times(all burst into laughter,cheers for Tracey and Daisy)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “supplimented with a poem(all burst into laughter)...as i told after i succeeded at the first attempt(all laugh) the little brat told me quote,’good to hear Trace that after your days(all laugh) the rest days are getting ready(all laugh)/but Trace only patience arouses the joy please remember while you’re too greedy(all laugh uncontrollably,tears,.)’ ”
Lillie(laugh) : “i was told to imbalance my lion(all laugh)..this is according to the order who approached whom(all laugh)..so i was told to become very professional with him and look after Gili all by myself and appease him(all laugh) and it appeases even more cause Malamar and Darkrai(all laugh) talk about first pokefriends(all laugh) they always help me(all laugh) and i’m professional with them(all laugh) no really if you have Darkramar that too best trained to maximum you will have no trouble what-so-ever(all laugh) and they give Gili all company but on the field look at the combination(all laugh),if water Seismitoad,if fire Incineroar,if grass then Whimsicott,if trees Yveltal,if steel Dialga,if ground Krookodile,if ghost/psychic Lunala and Musharna(all laugh) if dragons then Dragonite(all laugh),if electric Luxray,if ice or dark then Weavile and Zeraora and Giti(all laugh) as usual as personal assistant whole time(all laugh and .,Gary shakes his head laughing) always whins to him to maximum(all laugh) no really you know a Giratina of all pokemons and then Zeraora and what they do(all laugh) so he is unhappy outside cause the whole world is being personal with him(all laugh) and happy inside cause all here are being professional(all laugh) so now when he is outside he has to force himself being personal(all laugh) but in subconsious he wants to be professional(all laugh) but inside he can automatically be professional though again though in his subconsious he wants to be personal(all laugh) so thus he is sweetened to the maximum by me(all burst into laughter) and then when he is writting the most serious reports i will suddenly jump upon him snatching the pens away(all burst into laughter) and sob to him that would he not understand the personal connections ever(all burst into laughter)..this will totally pierce him up as outside he listened to his heart being personal but didn’t like it cause his mind told to do the opposite and thus inside he listened to his mind first and became professional but now he didn’t listen to his heart which told him to be personal(all laugh and calp)...so my balanced man is totally imbalanced now as he either doesn’t like doing what his heart says or doesn’t listen to his heart at all(all laugh) that is dangerous cause first means he doesn’t like pokemons(all laugh) and second means i’m only DESTINY(all laugh) so my poor lion is totally Lillied(all laugh,all cheer for Gary)...this was the psudeo confession plan(all laugh)...i was after he came back i was told how at which moment what emotion made sure that i get rid of my professional mask(all laugh) and now that i’m Lillied up(all laugh) and watered down(all laugh) i made sure to poke the balance(all laugh)..so the impersonal personally confessed(all burst into laughter)..yes what food we ordered(all burst into laughter) that was also noted down by setting Giratina upon them(all burst into laughter)..and this trick works each time with my professional lion(all laugh,cheer for Gary and Lillie)..”
Gary(laugh) : “really this pest has been after me for 37 years now(all laugh)..no matter monsterous or Mistyvious(all laugh) i must be consulted from telling him which pokemon that is(all laugh) to when pestered being complained to grandpa that i don’t like pokemons(all burst into laughter) to being consulted on how to properly complain like i did to his mom(all burst into laughter) to asking me if the badge i won was more difficult than his or not(all laugh) to coming up to me after i lost against him to tell him what mistakes he made(all burst into laughter) to logically validating 2 words(all laugh) to imaginary type specifications(all laugh) to manage the whole family from rejecting him cause they will swear him and tell me he’ll set his bunch upon us at any moment unless we all let them to stay in our rooms(all laugh) to how to manage only the gross needs of the whole world cause i’ll jump upon everyone if i handle the emotional side(all laugh)...and now after me about everything on legendary evolutions and illegal substances(all laugh) and that too alongside Whimsicott(all laugh)...aunt said so rightly,too Mistyfied to be serious(all burst into laughter)...this is about Ash Ketchum only but his better Misty friend cum in born Ketchumed wife(all laugh) isn’t by any means less(all laugh)...she has been pestering me since she married her husband under the VEIL of better friendship(all laugh) first why her Ash was being pestered by namecalled me(all laugh) then how i was much better than her Ash yet i lost in the round 1(all laugh) so her Ash will be namecalled throughout the match at 2 round while i was also namecalled before the match behind her husband’s back(all laugh) then how i namecalled was no match for her Ash when he beat me then after saying this about 2 months later was saying,’um..Gary,how many very good friends did my Ash..um..my best friend Ash had at school’(all burst into laughter) then i was eaten up by the wife as i was advising her husband to cajole her in proposing him first(all burst into laughter) which she did ultimately(all laugh) then i was sentimentally played via my personal connections(all laugh) to deliver extremely Mistyvious pictures(all laugh) failing to do which meant personal sabotage(all laugh) and all the while the recipient said like as i heard,’um..i understand emotions make one to use cosmetics(all burst into laughter) but Brock,doesn’t this actually damage the paper(all laugh uncontrollably)’ then i was everyday strictly ordered to call her Mrs Ketchum as well(all burst into laughter) then i was via proxy(all laugh) asked to demostrate the ways by which the husband approached girls in childhood(all burst into laughter) then as the husband was contacting me 5 times a day for may be total 30-35 minutes to ask about Zapdos to Raftosmoric(all laugh) yet calling his wife once in 10 days(all laugh) for 3 minuteas to tell her other girls are more beautiful than you unless you get rid of the cosmetics(all burst into laughter) because his wife was telling him to fondle her via phone(all laugh) and to the husband it disturbed his 300 dragon gym tours(all laugh) with a herd of Giratinas(all laugh) and his bunch’s legendary power levels for which i had to learn so many things to my utter disdain cause they weren’t my subjects but grandpa forced me to broaden my horizons(all burst into laughter) then no matter what i was beaked off every week atleast once as to why the wife has forgotten her husband’s number which was as later found out on her phone whole time(all laugh) and the husband never blocked anyone(all laugh) as everyone made made sure that i’m the right person to see off the both ends(all laugh) be in illusory troubles that was a phonecall away from being married again for umpteenth and most irritating thing for me was that the husband was calling me 2 times per day for 10 to 20 minutes on legendary battling(all laugh) and the wife was told just to catch the brat(all laugh) which was scoffed off saying the husband said she wasn’t the most beautiful girl(all burst into laughter) but was rather only more beautiful to other such girls(all burst into laughter)..and he was compelled to say this cause she was using cosmetics as usual(all laugh)..yeah the word was right then(all laugh)..all these were absolutely never about girls but all about cosmetics prices and the time taken to use them(all burst into laughter)..and the husband would’ve set his bunch upon me if wife’s name was mentioned(all laugh) cause the wife shut a door which was opened after 10 minutes(all laugh) but by then the husband was back to the obvious central battlefield(all burst into laughter) then most disturbingly the husband called me out on an emergency after putting my wife to absolute hell(all laugh) only for his wife by using a false alarm caused by him and communicated via optocal reflections only(all laugh) sweeten my wife up so much that we had to marry again by a stunning vulture killing oath(all laugh)..which showed me how foolish i was to pay an amount to a person who asks the obvious question(all burst into laughter) when that person was volunteering cause her husband married her again for the next time after the umpteenth one(all laugh) to make her become 5 year old(all laugh)..and then also the husband provided me a quote which made sure that i was more focused on ugliness rather than beauty(all laugh) that eventually also made my soulmate to lion up(all laugh) but had i told her that quote i would’ve been rejected to remarry again(all laugh)..and now each day the wife calls me if the husband is taking enough food for lunch or not,which is sent by her(all laugh)..cause certain 107 may not agree that the amount is right though they can’t take it(all laugh)..next time we are exchanging places with these two pests(all laugh)...”
Misty(laugh) : “well about cosmetics they are monitored minutely now(all laugh) except for the necessary creames and lotions,which must never be used unless absolutely necessary(all laugh) if one bit of beautification is done it will mean,’um..Mist..why use these when you have to wash them off(all burst into laughter)’..i once insinuated to him(all laugh) that he doesn’t want me to look PHYSICALLY(all laugh) beautiful(all laugh) cause he doesn’t like me(all laugh) and that mistake i’m never making again cause i was made to look PHYSICALLY beautiful to the most(all laugh) by his own hands(all burst into laughter)in privacy(all burst into laughter) but then after he thinks he should finish after 5 hours(all laugh) by his very own hands again washed them off(all laugh uncontrollably) showing how they’re creating an illusion of pride in my mind(all laugh uncontrollably) while damaging my skin(all burst into laughter) and this illusion of pride of beauty on gross body that ages with time is heinous and is always accelerated by cosmetics(all burst into laughter)..then(laugh)..then apologized to me cause excess water meant i may catch cold(all laugh uncontrollably) which was hot water used by sponge(all laugh) but still while they vapourize they extract latent heat(all burst into laughter) and compelled me to change dresses by intentionally making them wet while finally washing cosmetics(all laugh)..cause i might’ve caught heat(all laugh)..and my whole face and head and hands will made wet cause he will minutely point out that each moment he was tendering me like you know he with our little dolls that how his each touch is ulterior(all burst into laughter) and all cause i’m less dark BUT also points out at the same time that too much care for the body which he was doing can make me too infauated with it(all laugh and .) but why he was doing was that then my mind is on him and not on the body(all laugh) so this is a training that if not logic then atleast his memories that when i use a towel to dry up the face or hands or so on i must never be infatuated with the body so if not logic then my mind will be with my Ash while i’m tendering myself to shift the my focus away from me and then(laugh) my Ash all the time talks about anatomy so eventually then i’ll recall those and thus while tendering myself i think of my Ash and thus the logic too will come(all laugh and .)....my(all smile) sweet hubby...then(all smile) finally when i was ugly(all laugh) cause he made me look like i’ve just woke up(all burst into laughter) and gave me the oldest ordinary dresses(all laugh) did he say you look nice(all burst into laughter) but that was all cause though the upper cosmetics are gone the normal beauty which he’s complimenting is all because my skin didn’t secreate the dark pigments more(all laugh uncontrollably,tears)..and that exact statement means how much he enjoys it that i’m less dark cause his motives for 21 years are ulterior(all burst into laughter)..that was enough for this life(all laugh)...”
Brock(laugh) : “well Misty has always been cautioned on this(all laugh)..and now we too(all burst into laughter)...but Daisy sister your bit(all laugh)...
Daisy(laugh) : “Trace is told if he doesn’t like cosmetics then whin that all these are because of tasting the husband again(all burst into laughter) but as soon as i get bit sad do the same changing the meaning(all burst into laughter) but if i myself don’t(all laugh) then whin that can’t i read his mind(all burst into laughter) and then if i do agree to use then instantly discourage me insinuating the old husband idea with the same words(all laugh) then when i’m ready upend the process(all burst into laughter) and yes if i agree to either use or wash off each must be done by Trace only(all laugh) and then if he likes that and i do as well then of course he must do it himself(all burst into laughter),and all times that he has to do it by himself is to be done if hindered(all laugh) by whinning that unless he gets his way it means it’s only lesser half not other(all burst into laughter) and if i don’t like it then sob to me that all because of the fact that he is being unfairly treated that because of ages he can’t get the moments back(all burst into laughter)...and Trace also tricked me with variations(all burst into laughter)...Ketchum has got under my skin too well(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “i though was sternly warned not to use my wife’s cosmetics but to buy my own(all burst into laughter) else it means it’s a compettition(all laugh uncontrollably)...this is true pestering directed(all laugh)...”
Lillie(laugh) : “i’ve been told the better side(all laugh) if my lion wants cosmetics and i don’t then to scoff at him saying he doesn’t like me(all laugh) but as he desists do the opposite(all laugh) if he too doesn’t want it neither do i then whin that not telling him means he already assumes everything(all burst into laughter) then force him to do it by his own hands but very little and more little he does whin the opposite and viseversa(all laugh) straight from Whimsicoot book(all laugh) and he can’t show anger cause it means he doesn’t like me and also Whimsicott(all laugh) then if i want cosmetics and he too does then scoff at him saying you’re getting old so now again reinvigorating(all laugh) then as he desists change the meaning(all burst into laughter) then after 2 levels of cosmetics which he himself must do(all laugh) suddenly jump him saying if i was looking good PHYSICALLY(all burst into laughter) and if he is happy it means he doesn’t like me(all laugh) cause he only wants cosmetics all time(all laugh) if he wants less then the obvious that he doesn’t like me(all laugh) thus 2 levels(all laugh uncontrollably) and whatever he does he must do it by his own hands(all laugh) for the same levels(all laugh) then if i want cosmetics and he doesn’t it’s about freedom of expression(all laugh)...biased professional..(all laugh)...and each week thrice my lion is trapped cause there’s my own plus  107 infinite ways to get the job done(all laugh)...really bro has pushed his brother in very deep waters(all laugh) from which he can never get out either(all laugh)...wigged..hmm..(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “this brat is after my freedom of sanity now(all laugh)...”
Violet(laugh) : “if Brock doesn’t want cosmetics and i do i have to beak Brock’s head off with all sorts of questions(all laugh) and then when he is tired i’ll jump him saying only so cause i’m getting old(all laugh) then once he starts each moment whin to him that the level isn’t right cause he doesn’t like me(all laugh) and if i don’t and he also doesn’t then question his ability to read my mind(all laugh) if he does i don’t then it’s because i’m getting old and as he’s dejected change the meaning and again every moment whin that the level is wrong(all laugh) but if we both want it then it means though i’m getting old but he thinks i don’t need to be cared now(all laugh) which has a terrible anatomical insinuation(all burst into laughter) and thus each time my hubby is flattened and does it by his own hands(all laugh) and additionally if he wants it and i don’t then complain to mom(allburst into laughter) and agitate him then when he is dissapointed sob to him that how could he not read between lines(all burst into laughter) then as he has to do it with his own hands as well and when he does complain while doing it himself then each moment with age and as he scoffs say he doesn’t like me(all laugh) then again add the insinutation a BIT later anymore(all burst into laughter)...then if both then i’ll complain to mom or Flores or to anyone that Foster is influencing him by not careing about everything his wife wants(all burst into laughter) on exact issues that i want and Brock doesn’t like cosmetics(all laugh) then it’ll agitate Brock and he will tell me to look good PHYSICALLY(all laugh) now if Brock being a philosopher(all laugh) uses that i’ll cry my head off saying he doesn’t like me(all laugh) then he has to do it himself again and otherwise if that word isn’t used then i’ll again jump him saying and reminding him of phonecalls that Foster has influenced him to not care about his wife when she wants him beside him(all burst into laughter)...every time this gets my sweet husband(all laugh)...”
Brock(laugh) : “atleast he doesn’t involve Professor Oak(all burst into laughter) or other sisters and the great brother himself(all laugh)...and this ever gets Foster in safeside(all laugh) this brat ever  involves my family at my expense(all laugh)...and that brat himself is ever eager to serve his wife too much(all laugh)..Misty what about the other conditions(all laugh)...”
Misty(laugh) : “don’t be cunning Brock(all burst into laughter and .)...”
Ash(laugh) : “all about retirement(all burst into laughter)...right(all laugh),if you retire too it’ll be not fun cause there are too many ways(all laugh)”
Misty(laugh) : “well no matter what i do ultimately either mom will be told that he doesn’t like me(all laugh) and if mom scoffs at him it means she doesn’t like me(all laugh) which is said using each time mom insinuated(all laugh) that we weren’t married from day one(all laugh) then mom insinuates to me(all laugh) which no matter what would end up in he not liking me(all laugh) and i can’t say one word cause then battles will be Feraligated(all laugh) and i can’t shut the gym cause he will keep it open saying he doesn’t like me so doing that(all burst into laughter) and if then i scoff it’s terrible he will praise me to heaven to main staffs and challengers(all laugh) then next day shut the gym down for the first one hour or so saying people didn’t respect his wife unless he told them to(all laugh) so all sorts of compliments will come to me cause to all he will say he didn’t like me so i’m depressed(all laugh) and of course all have to budge cause ghosts are there(all laugh) and if he’s a gym leader it’s the obvious type(all laugh) this or he will use my bunch saying because of him i was holding my bunch up(all laugh)...no way will he be stern with me and do these(all laugh) and if nothing then will quote poems and all and good-bye poems as well(all laugh) then as i have to smile for my own sake(all laugh) immediately the meaning of the poem will be changed or the words to show me that angry or happy i’m his soulmate so nothing is me(all laugh)...and(all laugh) my projected bee is so sweetie...(laugh,all laugh) “
Daisy(laugh) : “well Mist flower your hubby has created a schism(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “it’s the retired-oldboy(all laugh)...but cosmetics was ever an issue...right(all laugh),so Brock the memries from 1st journey...”
Brock(laugh) : “i still remember first time Misty participated in a show for a mermaid in a water gym as a trial(all laugh)..thank God they were 16 then otherwise it would’ve had serious repurcussions cause he had just caught Buzzwole(all burst into laughter)..yeah that brat is after me for 21 years now wants me to fix his stings(all burst into laughter) then he first time tells Misty that she looks cute which just as he leaves i’m summoned and then the wife blushes saying,’um..does he want me..um..his best friend to..um..look ni..i mean am i looking nice(all laugh)...’ then the husband doesn’t watch the show(all laugh)..goes out with Buzzwole cause emotional matters are hindering him to ask any random stranger showing Buzzwole that who is that pokemon(all laugh)...so the better friend is sad after this rejection(all laugh)...and they were 16 the husband comes back who is sobbed to(all laugh),’um..Ash,why weren’t you in the show..i participated to show you..um..(all laugh)..i mean i participated to join my sisters(all laugh) and so on..’..’um..no you looked cute and show i just don’t like these emotional things(all laugh)...but you look nice anyway,Brock will cosmetics make a already cute person to look cuter(all burst into laughter)’...this sweetened the wife so much that at 16 she then says,’hum..so many normally cute cute girls isn’t it(all burst into laughter)...I LOOK WAY BETTER THAN THOSE NAMECALLS ALL THE NAMECALLED TIME(all laugh)..’...this sends a signal(all burst into laughter)...later i tell him showing a picture,‘Ash,this girl looks cute doesn’t she?’,’yeah just Mist(all burst into laughter)’ this started from that before that he only knew about the variation in darkness(all laugh)..now the mention of another girl meant,’yeah just Mist(all laugh)’..no really he says i learnt 999 ways of ulterior handshakes(all laugh) before going out i suddenly remembered once after may be 2 weeks or so says,’Brock,if when my Chu was in agony against Onix what would’ve happened if Onix for even for 1 second thought that he should press Chu more than you intended then would you have been able to detect it cause it was so quick and actually wasn’t done?”, i then laughed it off saying such things don’t happen they only follow the commands they don’t really want to hurt anyone but to beat them unless the masters wants so all was in my hand how long to keep Chu bound and not Onix cause i tamed him he will not use his own mind cause he is trained like that...but now i realized that he was talking about this jovial nature only where you have erased the thought of battling from your bunch and yourself...but anyway,later Misty danced with him in Maiden’s Peak where he told her,’Mist,you look cute anyway,you don’t need these(all laugh)’..that was something by itself(all laugh)..that day itself was something(all laugh)...then finally Misty is too much Ketchumed after dance(all laugh) and Ash says,’um..Brock Mist looked nice but why is it that being a girl it means something to her if i say that she looks nice(all burst into laughter)..i said i’m sorry but i have to make an urgent call(all laugh)..’yeah,but hey remember today i’m facing Geodude’(all burst into laughter)...then finally another time was that Misty probably wanted to go to a parlour or something to get her husband to sweet talk in a language that she could comprehend(all laugh)...so then the husband directly tells her,’why waste the money you look beautiful anyway,don’t waste you time here’(all laugh)...that was something(all laugh)..but to my utter irritation this brat involves my whole family all times in my moments with my flower(all laugh)...”
Violet(laugh) : “i’ve been told that my crook(all laugh) will only crook me if i’m too busy all the time(all laugh) cause the crook is too naive(all laugh)..and i was insinuated(all laugh) via Mantine’s behaviour when he forced mine to mingle with his(all laugh) that how one is nice and good but the other is too jovial(all laugh) yet they are both Mantines and friends(all laugh)..thus apply this knowledge(all laugh)...this means if too busy then i always think about Brock cause he then is the biggest infatuated husband cause he cares too much(all laugh) but when i’m not busy i don’t think about Brock at all cause then he’s greatest caring husband cause he doesn’t take too much care(all burst into laughter)...yeah my nature is sabotaged here(all laugh)..and if i’m not busy,Brock will think that i’m most caring wife so he can be relieved(all laugh) but if i’m busy then i’m little sweet wife too sweet too little(all laugh) so he can’t be relieved(all laugh)..so this is about balancing(all laugh) which is done by false alarms set up around the whole world so that Zekrom,Lapras,Aegislash,Noctowl,Spiritomb,Luxray and Solgaleo misbehaves(all laugh),look at who are chosen(all laugh) this to keep Brock too busy fondling them so that he he totally forgets me(all laugh) then i have have to keep myself unengaged(all laugh) as Celebi and Gardevoir for whole day will unnecessarily help me(all laugh)..again look at the names(all laugh)..those 2 pests will always roam around here and there circling me and will try to do everything in advance(all laugh)...so i’m so bored without work that i have to think about being busy with my husband then(all laugh) and Brock is so busy fondling the whole world(all laugh) that he will forget to fondle his little wife(all laugh)...now Brock will be reminded on my behalf in choised language by my family mostly mom(all laugh) using the rock-water sentiment(all burst into laughter) that he of all people was neglecting his wife(all burst into laughter) or even more dangerously either mostly Flores or Dad or whoever is free,will tell him how Foster is learning from him to neglect his wife by excusing profession(all burst into laughter) and this will either irritate Brock to call Foster(all laugh) who if free will tell him that he on the previous to previous night watched a documentary with his wife on Solrock(all uncontrollably laugh) this will make Brock to give up(all laugh) and come back to me immediately(all laugh) or if Brock doesn’t eat the bait(all laugh),then i will phone him and sob that now i’m not busy and he is showing it to my face(all burst into laughter)..that will make him either return immediately(all laugh) or when he does i get the treat(all laugh)..so this trick especially now has already worked twice in this week(all laugh)...later he will be phoned and again remimded that how water is better than rock(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well my flower has finally picked up the aged wife technique(all laugh)...right(all laugh),but i’m cunning(all laugh)..so(all laugh),i’ve got a few young flower dream posters(all burst into laughter,Misty bursts into laughter and Ash smacks her laughing which she tries to reciprocate but Ash squeezes her cheeks so that she can’t laugh then all laugh .ly)...”
Brock(laugh) : “the only way to trick Ash is to say that his marriage is a DESTINY(all burst into laughter)..but yeah Gengleye isn’t(all laugh)..Misty how’s this trick(all laugh)”
Misty(laugh) : “mom once had this slip of tounge(all laugh) i never in my worst nightmare can say this cause then it’ll mean both he and me are not soulmates and he would immediately try to proove this point by torturing himself and will show how he is here for flesh and blood only(all laugh) and then still would say if i want he will forsake his whole bunch including Chu but excluding Mime(all laugh) and pay me and all cause now i must immediately divorce him(all laugh) this trick is also to get rid of the language barrier(all laugh)..just wants to sweeten me up to maximum(all laugh)... and(laugh,all laugh) so mom made this terrible mistake(all laugh),’um..no mom it’s true that we are destined cause i saw so many beautiful girls(all burst into laughter)...’,goes on with whatever he can remember of my cosmetics(all laugh) changing the names(all laugh)..so mom was shocked cause i was present there(all laugh uncontrollably)..yeah in front of his wife and mom tells his mom so many beautiful girls were there except his wife(all laugh) which in reality is all about how beautiful his very wife looked at different times(all burst into laughter) and each time it will be mentioned like well still does it is mentioned that,’yeah that girl was PHYSICALLY beautiful(all laugh)’ that will deject the girl more than if she was told i’ve dumped you(all laugh)...and i’m also told the same,’um..Mist..you look sweet today but that’s only the appearence you’re way sweeter than this appearence(all laugh)’ anyway,then mom screamed saying what is this(al laugh) then directly says with absolute noncalancy that,’destiny means she is just a random sample that luckily came to me and was less dark so i got infatuated’(all laugh)..yeah exactly this language(all burst into laughter),then mom at first was stunned(all laugh) but then moments later understands it and laughs saying,’whoose less darkness were you describing’(all burst into laughter)...this is retorted as well(all laugh) he says,’um..mom it’s just the lack of black skin pigments(all burst into laughter) but she does seem to look a bit Misty today(all laugh) shouldn’t i have a better look(all burst into laughter)’..mom says look for the whole day i’m leaving(all laugh)...immedietly says,’mom,please wait i’m sorry just came back hasn’t seen her for a long time a bit emotional(all laugh) it’s ok i don’t want to discomfort you like this you please do or say as you wish’..mom was too pleased(all laugh) then later had a doubt(all laugh) asked me-i was laughing like a lunatic being on the spot(all laugh) but silently(all laugh)-,’um Mist,why is he so desperate to hug you in front of me(all burst into laughter)?’,i said,’mom,please forgive us but this is done to show(laugh) that he is never vulgar with me(all laugh uncontrollably)’..then mom was a bit scared(all burst into laughter),’um..but at this rate(all burst into laughter)..’,i just burst into laughter saying,’mom,i’ve never told you before but when he confessed to me first time all those 12 years back he said 2 words(all laugh uncontrollably)’...mom was spellbounded(all laugh),i almost had convulsions laughing(all laugh),’he agitated me then suddenly grabbed my hands and hugged me saying in this tone,’attitude?’(all burst into laughter)...then to make sure that we go to privacy cause that was in reservation(all laugh) he in this tone said,’privately’(all burst into laughter)...he just wants to show that he asks for permissions(all laugh) despite the fact that i’m coming here for 17 years now(all laugh) and calling you mom for exactly those many years(all laugh) and still if you think that he is at all ashamed that now i’m his wife so he has to have some reservations then you’re very much mistaken cause you know me and us for 17 years(all laugh)..he doesn’t at all have any reservations to his family about our 20 year long relationship rather i have(all laugh).he never knew anything beyond me in personal life nor did he ever try to or even had the remote thought of doing so first he confessed to me at my own home(all burst into laughter) then after he confessed to me first time,he didn’t have any problem calling you himself to straight say that i was his girlfriend(all burst into laughter) or even to my own sisters at our own home that he wants to pass some time alone with me(all burst into laughter) and thus now after so many years and all he is not at all ashamed to hug me in front of his family(all laugh) and infact fervantly regrets not doing so first thing 17 years ago(all burst into laughter) and infact this i know i shouldn’t say but if i don’t he himself will may be someday in his characteristic language that had dad been present dad he would’ve been more happy to do so cause he would’ve shown him that he with the trophy also has got married(all laugh) and so many times told me that if my mom and dad was present he after confessing might’ve directely taken me away with him(all burst into laughter) and all these is because he never has had anything to hide at all and thus thinks if you think after all these 20 years he should have some reservations about hugging me in front of you means you’re accusing him of vulgarity(All laugh) and thus these all is so that you know our relationship is so natural and longstanding that it’s too just easy for us and there’s no thought of vulgarity in him cause to him i’ve been his wife since he first saw me and thus only has thought about me and that too as a long married wife only(all laugh) and always told you about that but just didn’t have the language which he now has and is telling you that he is born as my husband and me as his wife and we will be so again and again like soulmates(all laugh) the exact word he wants to hear about us from the whole world(all laugh) and this all is done to show that not by a chance are we together but rather an inevitability so that you never think that i or he is neglecting you(all burst into laughter) cause we’re too easy about ourselves and it’s natural and it’s been too long now(all laugh) so there’s no trouble at all(all laugh)..then mom finally was almost in tears laughing(all laugh) said,’i see totally Mistyfied for 20 years from first sight(all laugh) and infact his vultures include me as well(all uncontrollably laugh) but i only hope he atleast spares the vultures for accusing his own parents(uncontrollably laugh,tears)’,i said he doesn’t(all laugh uncontrollably,tears,fits of laughter) to this mom almost fainted(all laugh) then i said he knows every detail about how my parents met and married too(all burst into laughter) then he was summoned(all laugh),’Ash,what do you know about your dad(all laugh)?’,then saw me silently laughing(all laugh) so realized it and with absolute nonchalancy asks,’um..you mean his career details or about how he and you got married(all burst into laughter)?’ then mom is very angry(all laugh) says,’career i know your reach is too dark now(all burst into laughter) but why are you trying to lessen the darkness in places where it should be absolutely dark to absolutely everyone except the two concerned(all laugh) and why are you telling people around whatever you’ve done in darkness for 20 years with your wife(all burst into laughter)?’,then this of course doesn’t appease my hubby cause dad’s career he came to know in full later which must be told to mom umpteenth times to make her realize that the memories mean rather than the obvious dad is still present(both laugh,all else smile) so uses the dark pests to control both of us and says,’no career in detailes i only came to know now,starter Charmander became Charmillion refused to evolve further,then Infernape,Talonflame,Delphox,Victini,Blacephalon,Houndoom,Salazzle,Magmorter,Heatmore and Volcarona then had Mantine,Floatzel,Meganium and Pachirisu let go of 2 pokemons Serperier and Emolga and had one psudeo-legend in Victini and you saw all of these except the 2 and then he started Kanto at 16,2 gyms 1 competition 4 pokemons returned,then again at 19 went to Hoenn,1st gym 3 pokemons had to return then 23 once more at Kanto this time looking to become fire type expert got most of bunch then travelled for 1.75 years got 8 more pokemons yet couldn’t complete the 3 years returned at 24.75 then at 26.25 met you at 21.75 years(all burst into laughter) at Levender you were 6 months or 7 at the office after completing your degrees at the same city(all laugh) and then next 2.5 years was here then went out on an emergency then inside our minds Meganium wasn’t taken but i saw her till i was 3 months old(laugh,all laugh) was ill actually for 1.5 years and the fire gym and so on just the time given and he would’ve been here during the Orange break pshycially(all laugh) when you met your daughter-in-law first PHYSICALLY(all burst into laughter) then those two pests were off(all laugh)..so mom was still angry says,’yeah i’m 62 JUST now(all burst into laughter) so at 21.75(all burst into laughter) what i felt should be exactly there(all burst into laughter) and also same for your dad cause i also happen to be your mom(all burst into laughter) so i also happen to know that at 66.5 he wouldn’t have liked to listen to what his son has extracted about his MENTAL ACTIVITIES at 26.25 via these two meances to society lurking behind the same with FULL FREEDOM(all uncontrollbaly laugh) so tell me about the other halves and these two venerables have bestowed and IS BESTOWING upon you(all burst into laughter)..’,so my hubby was silently laughing i could understand(all laugh) and says WITHOUT THE VENERABLE HELP(all laugh) that,well,mom you know about me and Mist only too well it’s ever been that we got married at the very first sight(all laugh) and as a result you see she is calling you mom for 17 years now(all laugh) the previous three was because we were too young to understand anything(all laugh) and you also may know Brock and Trace ever knew about us and the viseversa it’s no big deal and neither is it for Gary and the darkness is maintained at right places but about us i just ever told our family my brothers here and sister-in-laws that’s all all too well known to them just a get together that we enjoy cause i’m back after such a fiasco and have had to deal with this much and Mist even way more than me just reminiscences i only ever told them that i intentionally held her hands for ulterior motives(all laugh) at the age of 18 for the first time but the ulterior part didn’t materialize as the word suggests in general cause the motive was only to have her near me and i only ever want to lose myself at her presence hugging her at most that’s all and i’ve been doing the atmost for about 17 years now right in front of Brock(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing,Violet uncontrollably laugh) and never tried to remember when i held her hands before that if Trace was there or not(all laugh) and neither did the two ever bother about us only telling us to make it formal ever(all burst into laughter) they ever you know are both of our big bros as jackals(all burst into laughter) only too happy to see this and we the same though they do keep things in darkness way more than us(all burst into laughter) but it doesn’t matter cause Mist knows everything personal the moments and thus me too(all laugh) it’s no big deal a husband and wife hugs after a long separation for a month or two due to works anywhere public or private no big deal as the public is only family and not random strangers(all laugh) or even if strangers there’s no vulgarity(all laugh) so hardly a big deal for us though we don’t do it in public like certain someone not high in life(all laugh) at Kalos tried and thus the whole family can’t forget the lesson atleast till temporal distance(all burst into laughter) but also like at a secluded forest(all laugh) or a gym reservation area cause both even if not public has pokemons(all burst into laughter) but i always hugged her right in front of my bunch(all laugh) and thus many then now all know that she is their second master for this life which you surely know with my Chu being with my Mist all the time no matter what even went in pokeballs and even obeyed her more than me may be cause he too agreed with me on being asked(all laugh) that she’s my soulmate(all burst into laughter) and about dad,well i told you a bit about the career and about the first time you met him it’s same as Mist met me no difference just asked Mr Carl about it(all laugh) too happily said and Mrs Perry too confirmed(all laugh)...then got Mr Jhon,Bobby,Leslie(all laugh) and also Mrs Sandra and Bianca(all laugh) so yeah about the first sight i know about his position same as me and Mist knows your position(all burst into laughter) same as her and the only thing was that dad was in an extremely difficult situation not then but before for very long which despite his absence he made sure i never had to face and you weren’t in our profession just that Pidgey(all laugh) 1.5 months,should’ve kept her like Zara has(all laugh) but now if you learn 7 days about Mime more throughly while training her to be more connected to you and yourself to her and interpret that in your language then you can take down a bunch Mewtwos for sure (all laugh) without battling as you know(all laugh) so enough professionality cause it means you’re 8 league,7 Elite4 in hall of fame(all laugh) and about the 5 days(all laugh) they told what they know and could recall and from what i heard from you and may be from Professor(all laugh) i in my ideas and by my intuitions filled up the rest(all burst into laughter) and same for Mist’s parents my mom and dad there,much well known gym leaders the gym itself has history and all so these are learnt by me as you know i smell AH!History!(all laugh)’,now this means my mom and dad here must absolutely be brought out of mind cause these discussions were in front of dad so they too must be present(all laugh) so the venerables now cease us again(all laugh)..and he continues,’my mom and dad in-law about them the gym has HISTORY(all laugh) and of course Daisy knows everything was 19 old enough then itself and Violet the same though not that old(all burst into laughter,Daisy and Violet both uncontrollably laugh) so then about them well mom went out 16 to 19 Kanto and Orange and grandpa there was gym leader mom was single child so despite her other talents had to take over the gym as soon as she could(all laugh) returned took over the gym was as good as Daisy was at her best(all laugh) but both due to other talents and INGRAINED PROPENSITIES wasn’t as focused as Mist is on battling and gym managing not gym leading that is(all burst into laughter) the perfect gym leader is the one who can manage everything the outside hazards as well hence Mist needs her husband and mom too needed dad but Trace due to his too nice nature and knowing the same in Daisy discouraged Daisy(all burst into laughter,Daisy and Tracey uncontrollbaly laugh) which is the right thing to do cause Daisy is too gentle to handle recovery from bruises but not they themselves(all burst into laughter) hence the bruises would’ve taken over hence she would’ve had to quit it(all laugh) anyway,so at 22 mom there met dad who was out of profession just had a Spinda(all laugh) and was the gym official head the post Sarah as at now Brauch has been there for long though(all laugh),Brauch now is 62 and dad would’ve been 74 so yeah 12 years and Brauch joined at the age of 34 himself and thus 28 years back and dad was still alive then,next year went into abstraction and then dad couldn’t continue the office works for last 2 years of his illness and then next two also another two persons did then Sarah came in when mom was 46 and herself wasn’t well and with the gym etc and this was also the year before mom too followed dad into abstraction and so Sarah also is out of profession then was 36 and thus she is 60 now(all laugh)..yeah,whole thing will be said as you know(all laugh)..then Laurent their first son was born when Brauch was 28 and then Victor when he was 31 and hence when Victor and Laurent came in the gym they were 10 and 7 respectively,Laurent is out of profession and Victor stays as you know main referee and very good as well that is(all laugh) anyway,Mr George Waterflower was my dad-in-law and Mrs Rebecca Smith Waterflower was my mom-in-law and so back to them(all laugh)..yeah,even the names were mentioned(all laugh) and i looked at mom she was so angry(all laugh) but the meances to society had gripped her by then(all laugh) i was spared then thankfully(all laugh) but it was harder for me(all laugh) so he realized it and put the pests on me as well(all laugh)..so he continues,and dad was 25 when he accepted the job at Cerulian then and then mom was 25 and dad 28 when they married and mom was also in the water show and singing etc but it was just as a hobby and then they Daisy came here in this psychophysical form(all brust into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs) when mom was 28 and Mist when she was 35 was a good renouned gym but mom and dad both were not of that nature to go head on into something was much gentle in nature mom though not from outside so much but the reality(all burst into laughter) and yeah by the way this gym gym gym i've been hearing this word since day 0 here(all laugh) i've been to 1250 gyms across the whole world including the obvious(all laugh) and 1234 were hall of fames at my time of visit and i see no difference why one Seaking can't beat a Kyurem cause both are born(all burst into laughter)..yeah this my bee said cause he as you know too angry if non hall of fame gyms are compared to them especially the obvious(all laugh)...anyway,then at 47 dad suddenly went into abstraction suddenly after a disease for 3 years and mom still apprised Daisy to complete her travel and then she returned and within 3 months mom also went into abstraction due to a disease but not of that type(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing)..’..yeah my bee said and says exactly these as you know the two venerables say death is a 93/97 abstract 2/1007 potentially gross tickling method(all burst into laughter) so anyway(laugh,all laugh) he says,yeah then the gym was checked for all sorts of things including health issues cause both were very rare diseases and so on Daisy handled a lot when she was 19-20 sweet little kid that too girl who are more emotional when young especially due to this strange psychophysical existence(all burst into laughter) so annyway(laugh,all laugh),committee of course didn’t come to any use as usual(all laugh) and this is about the whole picture i also happen to know about Mr and Mrs Slate(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) and well they both were gym leaders for some times and both are 73 now(all laugh) and yeah i also know about uncle and aunt as well(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing)..uncle(laugh,all laugh)..no he even continued that and of course mom was by then dissapointed(all laugh) and i thought if she says yeah food or someting despite being at lab(all laugh),you may know that i’m RICH(all laugh) so anyway he continues..so,yeah uncle and aunt met when they were 13(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) and they married at 21 and then Gary was born 15 days before me on 17th December as Mr Oak(all laugh) doctors told uncle and aunt when they came to know they said,actually we were told,tell my parents this is Mr Oak(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing),thus aunty named him Gary cause that’s that type of Gary which has two edges(all burst into laughter)..well(laugh,all laugh),this he told me later(all laugh) if at all he did that is being of that type in duality(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs)..then says uncle had only one pokemon a Pidgey(all laugh) and still he evolved into Pidgeoto even in two years mind it human(all laugh)..and then though he left him at sanctuary we all have seen him and aunty had one Beautifly which also went to sanctuary and so on and then the rest you know and thus i know their journey a bit(all laugh) they did only Kanto and so i know that and then Mr and Mrs Slate(all laugh) Mr Kane Slate,Doctor Brock Slate’s dad(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) he is 73 now(all laugh) he travelled through Kanto and Johto for the gym leader post at Pewter and then from 20 actually he travelled for 4 years in total so from 20 to 25 he was gym leader then went on to general training travelled Johto till 28 then again returned to gym leading at 29 and then during his Johto travel met Mrs Giana Raskin Slate who also is 73 now(all laugh) they were travel companions infact she was water gym leader at  Yevstar Town,Johto and she too travelled Kanto+Orange from 16 to 19 then gym leader from 19-25 then went out general training at Johto then again was gym leader from 29 to 31 then went to Pewter and married Mr Slate and when both were 32 suddenly one day they heard this oracle AH!BEING HUMAN!FEELS SO NAIVE!(all burst into laughter,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs,Brock shakes his head laughing) then Doctor Brock Slate was born,then when he was 3 Mr Slate went out again to Kanto as trainer and was there for 2.5 years and then he was 39 when Edmond was born then when Edmond was 3 Mrs Slate returned to Yevstar Town as a gym leader and continued there from 42-43 there and returned again then Foster was born when she was 44 and he’s the current gym leader there then she was 48 Gemma was bron and then she returned to gym leading at Yevstar again from 52-55 then again from 57-58 before handing the gym over completely to her relatives and thus she has been a gym leader for total 12 years but you see these gaps,their nature and that of Brock are why i was interested(all laugh),Edmond was taken with her at 3 stayed at Yvester from 3-4 then Gemma same from 4-7 actually,Foster was at Pewter and Brock became leader and then he too returned for 6 months after our Kanto journey finished and then these gaps were because Mr and Mrs Slate couldn’t come in terms with their career pursuits,married life,responsibility sharing and so on but this is like if you assume my and Mist’s case in the 4 year break-up time and the intensity is decreased to the level of not staying together and not talking 7 days a week but 3(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing),this actually was also Yevstar to Pewter distance that is a bit long but it takes for my travel alone now 38 minutes door-to-door(all laugh) but me and Mist stayed at that speed 2:15 hours apart(all laugh) and then my dragons couldn’t travel as fast so that was another thing(all laugh) but the thing is that they were ever in contact and so on thus never was the case that it went out of family so it was alright personally a bit strainous(all laugh) and strangely then Brock and Violet met at 20(all laugh) then Brock went out with us at 21 and Violet from 22 started her expansive travelling(all burst into laughter) Violet returned to Viridian at the age of 36 and you know her career being at this lab makes even internationally famous stars too intriguing to public(all laugh) and then married Brock at 38 so they had similar kind of situation for 14 long years(all laugh) but here i must say i didn’t do my service to any of my elder sisters being the first one to enter their family as in-law illegally at 16(all burst into laughter) no Mist was a sweet little kid then i was cunning enough so took this opportunity(all burst into laughter) thus all of them unnecessary was much pained cause my bros here are too gentle to force anything(all burst into laughter) so i reviewed them as well(all burst into laughter).."
Gary(laugh) : "man,i've been cursed since day 0(all laugh) mom and dad and my parents there at gym and uncle ALL KNEW THIS PEST WILL COME SO BOOKED THE SAFEST SEAT(all laugh)"
Tracey(laugh) :  "and i should've listened to dad and bro you know after all they were right by every means(all laugh)"
Brock(laugh) : "just should've killed these two pests off in jungle and smuggled the bodies(all laugh) would've still returned to discuss philosophy and Corsola(all laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "CORSOLA(all laugh) but why my side is mumb(all laugh)"
Violet(laugh) : "waiting to smuggle to Boulder(all burst into laughter)"
Daisy(laugh) : "well,only such pests could tell me before registration in that situation that i've eavesdropped your life(all laugh) and then send me back with ghosts to protect me by making me insane(all laugh)"
Lillie(laugh) : "and i was on-the-fly(all laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "then my bee told about you all(all laugh) it was brief and like this,Trace went to gym and Daisy was there day one they at first sight realized are here only to help each other realize the relity of their beings behind their idea of being hence went along(all laugh) and same for Brock and Violet and Lillie and Gary all of whom i happen to know first hand(all laugh) and yeah i pushed them then cause i had to know if me and Mist belonged to them and the viseversa and so on in the ideological sphere that is(all burst into laughter) cause after all Mist jumped on me who was stranger(all laugh) none of her sisters did this and none of my bros did this it was normal unlike us(all laugh) and hence my bros weren't as cunning as i am surely(all laugh) and Mist is only too much more simple than her sisters who are more prudent cause they were older at a time when this test of character came and hence they were more self established but just like them Mist ever has honoured her longing for me for 20 years you see through thick and thin and that too without any assurence at all which still is the case cause i know myself all for so and so(all laugh)thus Mist only ever took my cunning advances as truth and took them for her assurence and still you see her honouring our marriage and so on whereas i forgot her in Unova as i told you before only knew about my bunch that is actually not very clean a logical explanation(all laugh) and this assurence in full truth by every means of it in it's truest possible meaning which is explained thus in the polished language of my Guzzlord(all laugh) is that which surely her sisters have had since day 1 from my bros hence you see i'm under probation still(all burst into laughter)..now the two meances were off cause he was now expecting to laugh at the reply(all laugh) then mom was dissapointed and says your vultures have resurfaced in the opposite direction i see(all laugh) so your trouble now is the actual meanings of the words(all burst into laughter) at which your Hoopa explores new horizons each moment along with these two to show that to all despite you and most importantly them(all burst into laughter) now again pests grasped us and my bee says,no mom my trouble is that why would this idea of gender persist with me more than necessary after all(all laugh) that is if a pretty girl in that type of age range(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) suddenly pops up in front of me why even at 36 this attention(all burst into laughter) my bunch doesn't have this trouble(all burst into laughter) take Charizard for example,what does he know more as himself than me hence he's so happy(all burst into laughter) others like Bayleaf and Heracross(all laugh) still they only bother in the breeding season never in any other time and that's mechanical to them even so in a way they also never bother why is it the trouble for me that i can't stay attuned to my wife all time(al laugh) now pests were off so mom gravely said,unless you are with these two meances to personal life AND SANITY(all laugh) in subtlty so much as to you have to discuss this with your mom in front of your wife why is she not of your gender but of that of your mom(all burst into laughter) thus you expect your mom to enlighten you upon this fact at the age of 62 to your 36.99(all uncontrollbaly laugh,Misty in fits of laughter and in tears laughing,Ash laughs a lot) then pests were at us again and my psychophysical hubby said(all burst into laughter),no this idea of gender so confining hence my Chu never got mingled just like Zekrom(all burst into laughter) you see Zekrom their view of life is the weakness of strength and the strength of weakness intersect at a point where you're balanced enough to kill everyone else(all laugh),thus they must be asked what is natural weakness of nature(all burst into laughter),then they will go to their own strength points to decimate whole nature to try to figure it out but mentally that is(all laugh) thus they will come to know the trouble of nature is that it is known as nature(all burst into laughter) then Zekrom must be asked what is the strength of weakness of nature(all laugh) then they will try to figure out their weaknesses and then think why they exist to see if they have any meaning thus they might be of strong point thus they will realize all weaknesses are inherent to their idea of themselves only from the point of view of nature(all laugh) which was proved to be the trouble to begin with cause they think it's the nature(all laugh) now they must be asked to differentiate between cognition and perception(all burst into laughter) now they will realize perception comes from trusting the nature of themselves which is proved to be troublesome thus cognition the next step is also wrong so they are totally wrong to think that they are Zekroms(all burst into laughter) or anything else that is(all laugh) now they must be questioned what is the diffrence between digestion and the idea of it(all burst into laughter) now they will realize that digestion is natural but the idea forces them to think they might have or not thus excretion or hunger comes which has no meaning(all burst into laughter) then they will understand this idea also comes because of themselves which are not hence the ideas are useless(all laugh) then they are to be asked what is the difference between thought and determination(all burst into laughter) then they will realize that thoughts are coming and going due to determination of being a Zekrom and viseversa(all laugh) hence actually nothing is there as a Zekrom hence they are freed from there own being thus they will want all to take to thier realizations of course by interacting with their nevres to a degree that's according to Zekrom is necessary for the humans(all laugh) and hece they want to get close to everyone mentally only to show they are no being at all hence their thought of so isn't so either(all laugh) thus they aren't interacting with a Zekrom then this same process that got the Zekrom out of his own being will encompass this human in psychic channels(all laugh) and he or she will be free thus my Zekrom wants to marry everyone showing them they have married just their idea of the same(all burst into laughter) hence they are freed(all burst into laughter) but this idea is not so vivid to me hence Mist is still in parts psychophysical to me(all laugh) yeah the degree may be more or less but why does she have a form(all burst into laughter) this my Kyurem and Giratina answers cause in each moment she wrongly thinks she is born(all burst into laughter) and so do i so we actually are helping each other to get rid of this idea of being and she is my wife cause her and my path to achieve the same requires our current views to contrast yet support the individual hence they are same yet opposite hence we appear to each other as different yet same and hence we are most dear to each other in that type of relation(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) thus we're married(all laugh) and this appearing difference of our ideas of unfodment of self from being yet that exact opposite being most necessary for our process is why we are of different gender exactly what is troubling us and me for sure(all burst into laughter) which also encompasses my bros here especially Gary as Gary says(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laugh) hence their lives are similar like as said that of Gary and Lillie as again Gary told me(all laugh)..Mr Oak any opinions being that type of Mrs Oak(all burst into laughter)
Gary(laugh) : "yeah,hence your Gyarados' beau is a damn brat as well(all laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "Mr Oak why is called beau(all burst into laughter)"
Gary(laugh) : "yeah,your hubby pest has definitely rubbed you the wrong way(all laugh)"
Ash(laugh) : "Mr Oak now you said Lillie now why did you say why is called Lil and not Lie(all burst into laughter)..any help sister(all laugh).."
Lillie(all laugh) : "man,this is serious stuff(all laugh) AH!Mr Oak why are you called Gary Oak (all laugh)"
Gary(laugh) : "cause i've been forced to live the Giratina life of accomodation of trivial to get the whole only which is trivial(all laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "hence it's called Mr Oak(all laugh),anyway then my hubby continues,anyway,then i looked at Mr and Mrs Maple(all burst into laughter) thus asked them(all uncontrollbaly laugh) no not me via my sources(all laugh),Mr Hopkins Smugchal,Domurtsburg City,Normal gym,Hoenn was Mr Maple’s travel companion,they travelled across Hoenn,Johto and Sinnoh for more than 7 long years total 8 then Mr Maple took charge at 24 and was extremely good since the start,Mr Hopkins too same was already in hall of fame before Mr Maple was,who was unnecessarily delayed by the great so and so who had to update their textbooks after Snorlax,a normal type got me the title(all laugh) then he was asked when i was Hoenn by my sources at Hoenn i had Hoopa and Gourgeist at press conferences(all laugh) and many things were being said then Hoopa said get the real meaning and Gourgeist added then 2nd step is just the meaning without links(all burst into laughter)..so i understood they told me to see the soulmate as it is without links hence i couldn’t be confining myself to only here these four families(all laugh) then i forced Trevor to get my required infos(all burst into laughter)..well,you know,Trevor and we have come into terms now and he says all these blurred my vision(all laugh) to which my bee said yeah,i understand that i was mad then myself(all laugh) but Jasu is of no use is he(all laugh),and Trevor said well to me of huge use cause i'm so happily retired(all laugh) then we both said yeah that age(all laugh) and then he continues,so Mr Norman Maple,hall of fame then became the Pettelsberg gym leader at 24 and then Mrs Catherine Maple she isn’t from our profession and doesn’t have any pokemons either,they met at a party when Mr Maple was 26 and she was 25,she is an accountant infact like you and then they married when Mr Maple was 28,Mrs Maple 27 and May came into current existence when they were 30 and 29 respectively(all laugh) and Max when they were 34 and 33(all laugh) then i met them when they were 47 and 46(all laugh)..so this numbered list went on(all laugh)..so their family and life very smooth perfectly epitomizes the name Balance for the badge that is(all laugh) then May and Drew met when they were 16 in front me infact(all laugh) and they are very sweet natured persons and Max and his girlfriend Mia too similar so these enstrengthed my intuitions(all burst into laughter) and Drew's parents are too sweet persons Mr Ervine and Mrs Amelia Blackmore both out of profession and doesn't have any pokemons and is in good jobs now retired though and i spoke to them many times they actually ever told me Drew has a big bro as well(all burst into laughter) about them May told me once so i knew that(all laugh) theirs was an arranged marriage actually no not famillial the dates were arranged by friends same stuff(all burst into laughter) and Dave’s case i knew cause i know the family all similar like Brawn(all laugh) everhappy and sweet Brawn confessed to Mrs Lucy when he was mid ocean at Cerulian surfing his phone somehow worked cause she was at a boat(all burst into laughter) but thus all these intrigued me(all burst into laughter) to look at Mr and Mrs Skechit and also Mr Hector Skechit(all burst into laughter,Tracey uncontrollbaly laughs) this was hard cause they were totally out of profession thus i used Trace(all burst into laughter) actually it was just the week before the day i married Mist i pressed him with my psychics not them(all laugh) then knew a bit cause he knew a bit(all laugh) this was about Mr Desmond Skechit and Mrs Rebecca Chansbert Skechit but not Mr Hector Skechit(all burts into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) as you know i came to know about Hector from himself infact when he realized that Trace was all along right and Trace also realized why Hector and Mr Desmond was right that if he got into his current profession,he will be mentally taken for granted by certain pests like these two fodnly though(all burst into laughter),so actually this Skechit family was most engaging(all burst into laughter,Daisy and Tracey uncontrollbaly laugh) thus you see,Mr Desmond Skechit was at a general govt administration job and was very strict person more so cause of his job that is very hard but he in these days in retirement are happy cause my bunch actually was invited by him as you know(all burst into laughter) i took Pelipper and Rayquaza(all burst into laughter),Pelipper told him this idea of something that is like a target or a thing very charming cause they are most suitable to the right way perceived may be true but for that why the person will be suffereing cause after all the deal is that he is the one who searches that happiness in reverse as well hence the real deal is to be searching unhappiness within then the outside unhappiness is mitigated cause already the stomach on fire why look at someone else's hunger unless it's rather endearing to know that after all he's my food(all burst into laughter) then Rayquaza says thus it's realizable actually according to dragonic manuals why we must prey the right kind of food that if examined by looking through the right kind of eye of a dragon(all burst into laughter) it is seen that this hunger is actually ever there no matter the prey or the hunter hence to get rid of this a dragon realizes he must be at all three elements euqally to prey(all burst into laughter),my comrade means that if this idea of dragonic hunting is if looked at properly then it is just that this very idea of another is the trouble that is why the deal exists between me and my doesn't it(all burst into laughter),hence according to the awakening of dragonic potential dictates that one must get rid of this my cause it's an hindernce to me the dragon if i know that i'm a dragon then what's the point of the idea of dragon to exist cause it's just me which is exactly why i don't understand this hence this idea has been created only by me(all brust into laughter) but still my current being tells me i'm a dragon so i ask you to show me what is a dragon(all burst into laughter),hence you see my comrade here means show yourself that you're a human knowing so to being with hence you can't cause that deal is potentially stale hence will definitely fail(all burst into laughter),thus you see like a dragon a human can't be specified hence why do you think you're a human and not a dragon(all burst into laughter) cause you know both but i'm claimed to be a dragon like you claim yourself to be a human thus make me dragon make yourself human you can't either thus why this futility(all burst into laughter),hence to deal with this trouble you must get rid of this idea of deal that is ever another why bother cause you really are what you are so why you will be this and thus not the other(all burst into laughter) this got Mr Desmond so happy that he actually told us why even at 79 he feels fresh enough to jump into ocean with Azumarill not Marill though(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) actually he said that his distaste from pokemons came from his idea that the money we get is not at all in the right way cause we kinda abuse natural resources(all laugh) his idea was to use pokemons in many developmental works and all as they are used but the business that our profession is was never a very good thing to him cause he faced many choised ones from our profession and being at Kanto it's understandable(all laugh) but he said this career that i've had till even i was at Elite4 Johto only to him was just that the translators were good and i was trying to sell this profession as something very high(all laugh) actually many philosophers and intellectuals contacted me before during my mid to late Elite4 saying you're diluting serious things(all laugh) i ever said well we everywhere talk about universality it's rather a tribute i guess just that you want it by other sources like you from whom we got the traslators right(all laugh) they understood that this only creates more job and money for them so were too happy(all laugh) as is the general govt ceratinly at Kalos,Unova,Sinnoh and Kanto all said yeah great call of the bottom line(all laugh) but now in an enjoyable way rather(all laugh) but yeah they realize all must be at my cost with my close ones cause the actualization of these require you to let your nerves be limitlessly meanuvered by pokemons like Kommo-O(all laugh) which is a great experience thought knowing their researches on metaphysics(all burst into laughter) so(laugh,all laugh),then Mrs Rebecca also had similar views and she being at finances knew which selected people deal in that section at Kanto pokemon authorities(all laugh) so they were rather not happy with this at all then their careers(all laugh),now Mrs Rebecca is also 78 and they were actually classmates at college there they met,Hector was born when both were 28 and Trace when they were 38 and now i also came to know about Hector from himself infact(all laugh) just his career and all,he also a brilliant student,is an engineer and then studied till 26 came out with a huge service as a project manager at a big compnay then later was in director post in another company and he had similar experiences himself and hence he never liked Trace's ambitions and then again he is 10 years younger(all laugh),Hector actually studied at Glubotstrog,Kalos for his degrees after basic engineering degree and then Trace was sent there then he fled the scene and as you know went to Orange and so on,whole family too cultured too nice too gentle(all laugh) and you know Trace with all these he also is a jackal(all laugh) so(laugh,all laugh),he has had his career and now Hector is alright with him and all and whole family is very good to him now but they actually ever had high respect for Daisy though cause she is a gym leader after all(all laugh) and has had a significant hand behind Cerulian's rise to where it is today a chosen anyway(all laugh) and all her sisters actually they did a lot for that forsaken anyway(all laugh) hence they had regards and respect and love for their daughter-in-law and sister-in-law that was ok but Hector's other half Mrs Amanda Amrsharst Skechit is also actually in the same company she is an engineer too they too met at college and she is also from Kanto,Redheart City actually,same age to Hector but Trace met Daisy at workplace though hence the relationship was more serious,matured,free and smooth hence of much longer term(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs)..no he said this as well(all laugh) and the pests of course had ceased us and mom was extremely angry and dissapointed(all laugh) hence the pests as well as their master pest was so much enjoying it and i could hardly stay alive(all laugh) then he said yeah i also by default happen to know Drew's life(all burst into laughter)and yeah it was good knowledge(all burst into laughter)and thus i was assured that my Mist is trapped in this psychophysical exsistence to be my wife(all burst into laughter) these i had to know cause i was in an illusion cause certain sections in my mind asked me what is the assurence that this is not a random sampling and distribution as an idea in holistic sense against which my Crawdaunt and Feraligator respectively has been working ceaselessly(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter) cause the distribution isn’t ever without the other hence the other is opposed and the current as well hence there’s no distribution at all(all burst into laughter) and the plan is to counter the self thus to get away from this cause one particular can’t be CHOSEN(all laugh) if theres a reason and which is why everything must be turned on against each other and on themselves mentally that is(all burst into laughter) and the result is the happiness that the two present here exudes(all burst into laughter) these all means that i was instructed by my bunch to look deep into things and hence these 6 families i came to know including my own(all laugh) simply cause of the nature as in a whole i know about my parents,uncle and aunt and Brock’s parents and my parents in law that there was mostly like Daisy and Lillie and Trace and Gary combined that is(all laugh) and i had to analyze many more things to get my Mist back properly(all laugh) and many hours were spent as you know in libraries and seclusion when these two including all the rest were guiding me cause they already had surpassed these phases(all burst into laughter) like Decidueye all time(all burst into laughter)’..now the two not at all abstract tickling guides were off again(all laugh),so mom was very angry but her full wrath was on the two pests(all laugh) so she says,’yeah i can see the lecture preparations ON-THE-FLY(all burst into laughter) but what have you GAINED from your beloved bunch of philosophical crooks(all burst into laughter)..cause i know very well Mimey atleast surely none of them can speak the things you’re speaking so i do know very well who is playing what they call that maddening tune(all burst into laughter) that’s these exact two ghosts(all burst into laughter)..surely your dad wanted you to be a pokemon master NOT GENGAR AND SABLEYE COMBINED(all burst into laughter)’...so my hubby was so happy i could understand that now even mom was using the right vulture language(all laugh) to properly say that he is Mr Gengar,from Ash Ketchum(all laugh),Pallet Forest(all laugh),tickling master,in hall of 4/13 th semi gross planes and all else(all laugh)..so he continues while the two pests were having more fun but this time not at our PHYSICAL ability’s cost(all laugh) so my bee says,just the reminiscences just the knowledge of the past and loving it learning from it then finally be the future to it as i am and just the idea that me and Mist are not alone(all burst into laughter and .)..and this also confirmed my belief to assurence that this all is not destiny(all laugh) for which this pursuit cause certain animate beings not pokemons or extraterrestrials(all laugh) hiding behind certain masks and feathers(all laugh) had other opinions..i don’t know if that is vulgarity cause it’s again only own parents at both side(all laugh)..who might’ve themselves told us(all burst into laughter)..if such situation arose and your know it did arise for all these 6 years cause of my worng ways to do right things(all laugh) and this fiasco..so i myself filled in gaps(all laugh)..and yes most important thing was why i was so interested to know(all laugh) cause i ever saw you and who you are and heard about dad from you then Professor then a few people here and there and could relate me and Mist to my parents(all laugh) same for her parents..i’m not telling these to my little nephew and nieaces unless i stay alive and able and they they ask at the right age(all burst into laughter)..and only if in the right situtaion..cause they may need like i did to disprove some imaginary theories(all laugh)..yeah i’ve a few psychics and ghost and dark types they can disturb people too enough(all laugh) then if i’m only honest and absolutely nothing else people speak their hearts out and only those are chosen who has that heart and absolutely none else(all laugh) and Mime being one of the psychics,you need seven days to be able to do the same(all burst into laughter) that is all(all laugh)...’ now this long lecture has got both of us to listen to it despite the ghosts cause i atleast knew they were called to the meeting for a particular reason at our cost(all laugh) but we didn’t anyway wanted to disturb in the middle cause you know you don’t want to stop this flow of contradictions(all laugh) to give you bare truth that you’ll adore for too long and all vultures were so beautifully roasted each moment(all laugh) but yeah all the time also despite their frequent jobs to keep us mumb behind him Gengleye was there silently laughing with tounges out(all burst into laughter)...then mom finally says,’i see already all darkness lessened to match colours(all burst into laughter) and i guess those two ghosts that are behind you gauging us so minutely(all laugh) while putting their tounges out and laughing in their heads at our inconvenience(all burst into laughter) and lurking to jump upon us at any moment even if not told so(all burst into laughter) are they telling you about their opinions and interpretations on ours about what people say before marriage as well(all laugh untcontrollably,tears)? And how they are ceaselessly fighting against the environment that should be present then(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter)’,’well they can push people enough to get names associated dear memories or honest mistakes out only if i’m honest and try(all uncontrollably laugh)..if the marriage is arranged(all laugh)..then it’s just to confirm the arrangement may be or may be even not that either(all laugh) that it’s said,would’ve been said if me and Mist met trough our friends and family and all and went out for our first date then later if we wished i would’ve asked her the same thing that i have asked her before our marriage(all burst into laughter) but if it was directly confirmed that we will marry each other just going to dates to enjoy our time or to still see whether we fit to live togethger or not then if it was such a case and we did want to get married then i would’ve atmost asked her,’i’m so happy that i will be passing the rest of my life alongside you hand in hand(all laugh) aren’t you too so excited about our upcoming official confirmation of our decision to live the dream togethger?’ and she would’ve reciprocated as,’as much as you but i’m already in dreams(all laugh and .)’ and then if even this wasn’t said then we anyway would’ve had to answer someone else asking us if we wanted to get married(all laugh) the answer to which is already officially announced in the invitiation cards(all burst into luaghter) but as luck would have it for asking again the obvious that person charges an amount(all uncontrollably laugh) and thus as you know i only confirmed it to the law and the government with all proper evidences and witnesses on the very next to next day itself and about this the similar thing of letting the law know it first thing is waht my dad did as well and we did the invitiations he held the ceremony very quickly,mine will take a long time cause of many hazards as you know but of us we just removed that certain person so that the disturbance isn’t present(all laugh) but for other cases like us and i’ve had the best of lucks to know my wife since the age of 16 since the first day of my career and her career as well in a sense and has lived life together for the next 5 years 24/7 even to my utmost satisfaction that 24/7 included a month at my own home(all burst into laughter) when you surely knew the lines no matter the spoken sentences(all laugh) or the meaning and the word(all laugh) as to why she was calling you mom from 3rd day(all laugh) and then of course on regional travels for our career pusposes and you know me and Mist were married already in our own minds certainly at the age of 19 when she came here for the first time if not way before(all burst into laughter) and thus you saw us then and also i am so happy that you know our relationship so well and we never have had to hide it at all(all laugh) and i’m so happy that i never had to be foisted upon at my face the ocean of garbage(all laugh) to find my soulmate or my sis back to back or many great friends throughout life without any effort and my sis came just like a sis of my own flesh and blood and my soulmate came just like you came to me as my mom  she did as my wife(all laugh) but rather the garbage came later(all burst into laughter) and thus the methods of burning them out in public like Kalos(all burst into laughter) and still as for the official confirmation by means of words in this case or in such cases in general i would’ve asked Mist,’would you marry me?’(all laugh) she reciprocates as,’with pleasure(all laugh)’ and that’s all nothing..’,’like less than 2 lines of garbage(all laugh uncontrollably)...’,’yeah Mist was being too obsessed(all laugh) with responsibility and i don’t like it and didn’t at any point (all laugh) neither do my bunch like it(All burst into laughter) cause it’s all about going overboard with day to day life and jobs or so called battles or being responsible pokemons(all burst into laughter) from which we all want respite at the end of the so why not that end day be prolonged to prevail upon the span from start to end as well(all burst into lughter) as much as possible that was my view as was that of my bunch(all laugh uncontrollably,tears) who influences me each moment(all laugh uncontrollably,tears) and certainly now is(all uncontrollalbly laugh,tears fits of laughter) and yeah my profession and especially my bunch helped to establish my belief and i did the same for them(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) so in my case i thought she didn’t like this attitude thus told her the same word(all laugh) in terms of interrogation(all laugh) to Mist that she was strorming away from me(all laugh) cause i didn’t want to say 2 lines(all laugh) asked her why was she showing the attitude(all laugh) only cause i’m just like this and though she can herself see that i long for her,which later according to the press was disputed though(all burst into laughter) and so this endeavour of theirs has humiliated only them abjectly for many years now and will continue to unless they apologize properly to themselves(all laugh) which being press they can’t(all burst into laughter) and you sure know in each press i had Giratina,Hoopa,Ultranercozma or others Hoopa reminded me to read in between lines and Giratina says watch over your own emotions as they are subject to change each moment while my Cozy said(all laugh) watch over your ego on what you already have thus ever stay starving on what you don't hence the press gets the things most clarified(all burst into laughter) hence my endeavours at the press for all these prolonged years(all burst into laughter),but anyway,so i longed for Mist and didn’t like that mask of responsibility(all laugh) and told her why attitude if you too long for me this much attitude just because i don’t want to tell you the lines and you won’t come to me and still delude yourself in thinking that i’m only ever too childish(all laugh) but as you know my bunch is still at the end of the day not humans(all laugh) thus can only give me abstract advises(all burst into laughter) but this actual idea of mine was actually wholeheartedly supported by Gary though(all burst into laughter,cheers for Gary,Gary shakes his head laughing) who said if no words are coming cause the familiarity and the longing was too much too long(all laugh) then just buy a ring and give it(all burst into laughter) thus he confirmed my intuition that words are no good but emotions are(all laugh) so that interrogation was to convey my emotion(all burst into laughter),but if i didn’t say that word just the emotions then it was most vulgar(all uncontrollably laugh) cause i would’ve cheated upon her trust on me(all laugh) which another someone from Kalos did(all laugh) as you know but i’ve got nothing to do with people or their families who can’t differentiate between a brother or a sister to a beau(all burst into laughter) cause they were ignorent during their lessons(all burst into laughter) this intuition of mine was also supported by Trace actually(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) who at Orange itself said nothing exists except either family relations or vulgarity in too close friendship in case of cross gender issues across certain ages(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollably laughs in tears laughing,Tracey shakes his head laughing) so then remembering this also i proceeded(all burst into laughter) so asked Mist if she reciprocates to my feelings for her,she too happily consented me so then i hugged her with ulterior motives(all burst into laughter) that she was my girlfriend now no more just best friend(all laugh) so i will marry her in future and thus can be a bit more comfortable with her(all laugh) but that was vulgar(All laugh) cause Brock said before(all uncontrollbaly laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) infact when i just about started 20/21 years ago itself(all laugh) that the difference between men and boys can’t be touched grossly but that’s just that feeling(all laugh) same thing applies here that that i could still cheat on her cause there are innumerable cases of even divorce the next morning after first night(all laugh) so that was vulgar(all laugh) and so told her to go to privacy to which she again consented but yeah she was my girlfriend then not wife officially(all laugh) so still vulgar no matter what as Brock,Trace and Gary in unison said(all burst into laughter) that i should actually directly marry Mist cause both have mentally since day one(all laugh) well she did i took about 2/3 weeks(all burst into laughter) so yeah that is exactly why as the fruit of action those spitting incidents has happened with me due to me(all laugh) and hence that was vulgar and my only defense was that we knew each other and our families too well for 8 preceeding years and both were above 19(all burst into laughter) but i never thought of her to not be my wife since atleast Viridian gym after 1 month in first journey and with her(all laugh) and neither has she so atleast it has been 12 years if not 20(all laugh) that me and Mist has been married and the middle 4 has long been totally erased if more than that so that’s all for your knowledge mom,sorry if i have been rude(all laugh) but it’s too natural so no point hinding behind the bushes(all laugh) that are imaginary only thus i see no trouble in hugging her in front of you(laugh) unless it disturbs your works(all laugh) or the things that you want to discuss and so on infact it’s been my wish that i can hug my wife in front of my parents(all laugh) cause my wife is your daughter here as well thus atleast once it’s more than possible i guess no more for sure(all burst into laughter and .)’...so this long long long discourse finishes(all lauall laugh),which was wholeheartedly and professionally supported by the great Professor Dr Gary Oak(all laugh,cheers for Mr Oak Mr Oak,all laugh) persistently and fully agreeed with by the great observer Dr Tracey Skechit(all laugh,cheers for The Bush,all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) and meticulously directed by Doctor Brock Slate since the beginning(all laugh,cheers for That FEELING,all burst into laughter,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs,Brock pats his forehead laughing) and minutely observed upon and helped also(all laugh) with ulterior tickling and reciprocating motives(all burst into laughter) by two dreadful ghostly pests and the discourse came with a sentimental card played to make a deal(all laugh) so i was trying to flee the scene as quickly as i could(all laugh),realizes it straight catches me(all laugh) and hugs me in a way that gave me respiratory dificulties(all burst into laughter),’um..mom,i’m sorry but just the emotions(all laugh)..same way happens in darkness as well(all laugh),you see i never viewed my wife as someone having a particular psychophysical form as much as i could hence there's no vulgarity thus no shame for me(all burst into laughter)..’ now i didn’t know what to do(all laugh) cause he won’t let me go first(all laugh) and if i try too much he will pick me up(all laugh) thus i was in his arms like a statue(all laugh)...now says,’mom i know it’s not exactly convenient to you but i feel unfulfilled in my soul if my soulmate doesn’t reciprocate me(all burst into laughter)’ so i had to hug him back(all laugh),exactly then says,’enough(all burst into laughter)’ now i was trying my best to wriggle away and finally mom sternly says,’let her go’ but before she could finish it i was on air(all burst into laughter)’ so then puts me down finally and totally forgetting that we were’nt alone(all laugh) finally says,’Mist you’re so sweetie(all laugh and .)’ and hugs me very quickly but i got choked(all laugh) so this after mom’s orders takes a couple of minutes(all laugh) then finally lets me go BUT hold my hands extremely tightly to almost break them(all laugh) and  mom says,’got your wish of one time,if again Mist will stay here you outside unless darkness darkens the day enough for you and your two lackies(all laugh) at 22 (all laugh)’..’yeah,thanks ‘mom(all burst into laughter),sorry if i disturbed you,but that exact line is what i told her in each greeting during the 7 years i was officially her boyfriend(all laugh) but my Mist is ever my sweetie each time cause she’s not psychophysical to me(all burst into laughter)..’,’don’t also call her psychophysical form as honey cause i do(all burst into laughter),see you later(all laugh)’..as soon as mom just about turned back i’m again up is the air psychophysically(all laugh) and loudly says cause mom was just outside,’mom you’re not chiding my bunch out of home are you?’(all burst into laughter)..then mom returns and says,’Ash,put her down(all burst into laughter)’..so i can come down and still won’t let me go holds my hands(all laugh)..now mom asks,’what is your exact problem Ash(all laugh)?’,says,’no mom not that but you see 15 years with many hazards still continuing and at my state now i want my Mist in my arms all time so i can’t and don’t want to control myself from hugging her when i’m at home so may be it can discomfort you so just saying but i’m not..’,mom understands its the next part of polite vulgarity(all laugh) so sympathises and that’s what my hubby wants so as soon as mom goes out of the room closes the door(all laugh) and hugs me to death now i try to say is this not to much tells me directly,’Mist,remind me an hour later that i’ve to prove to you(all laugh)..’ so i say fine then we can hold traditions now(all laugh) now i’m tricked cause he wants to lecture me(all laugh) as soon as i say traditions starts,’Mist,am i being vulgar(all burst into laughter)’ so now i try to do the honours(all laugh) but see him doesn’t want that at all so even i’m confused(all laugh) so i have to wife up then(all laugh) and after few minutes of silence of proximity(all laugh) again picks me up(all laugh) and finally says,’sweetie first got mom out of her age related issue of obsession with destiny(all burst into laughter) then fulfilled my wish that my parents themselves will help me to adore my wife in privacy(all burst into laughter) then refused you to postphone the formalities to uncertainty to make you too sweetened with uncertainty(all laugh and .) which never is enough cause you’re so sweetie(all laugh) now those two brats are back and this my hubby intentionally played to trick me as he says you’re too sweetie,the brats say,self to being to being to being to self tickling that is(all burst into laughter) see Mr Misty(all burst into laughter),this idea of yours to get tickled by master brat is only your idea not his skill(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears),cause you think you’r not tickled enough in self as you’re a being so using this tool you tickle your being and the tool is another being but this desire to be tickled is it you or your being(all burst into laughter),Mr Misty,can he tickle you more than your particular idea of his developing skills to your regenerating want(all burst into laughter)..then,i could barely stay alive after laughter(all laugh) then my hubby was in same state(all laugh) then the two brats showed self to self tickling(all laugh)..then went off and my bee says,see that’s why you’re so sweetie(all laugh),i realized my hubby is a true Gengar indeed cause as he said everything dear to him which obviously include the two pests to him the concentrated form is just me(all laugh) theoritically supported as well(all laugh) then he says,and finally because you’re way healthier now i will use you for weight training(all burst into laughter and .)..and i was on the air again(all laugh)..so that was some day for me doing weight training(all laugh)..and then after fondling me for like half an hour when i’m too much sweetened to walk properly(all laugh) called Gengleye again and said yeah tell Zeru to ask why is it called sweetening(all burst into laughter)..and what happened Mr Oak(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “two words you brat(all laugh),you two brats have spoiled the family(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “Mr Oak Mr Oak why is called by tool tickling(all burst into laughter).."
Misty(laugh) : “man that day was something,later mom was very apprehensive said,’do those ghosts tell him the exact lines(all burst into laughter)’ which i somehow managed(all laugh) and then she just said 15 years away just can’t take it(all laugh)...that was some experience with DESTINY(all laugh)...so(all laugh,laugh) no no tricks work with my sweet bee(all laugh)...very sweet(all laugh)...isn’t he(all laugh)..so(all laugh) sweet sweet(all laugh)...and(all laugh)....so cute(all laugh,laugh)...so(all laugh)...right(laugh,all laugh),how was the help(all laugh)”
Gary(laugh) : “no this brat has crossed all limits(all laugh),Ash why so much longing for 37 years(all laugh)?”
Ash(laugh) : “exactly what i told you in quotes(all laugh),the necessary is 2 lines(all laugh) the necessity is no lines(all laugh) thus balance it(all laugh) by unnecesseciating the necessary(all laugh)...hmm(all laugh)..wigged(all laugh)..did you get any help big sister(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “hi five ho bro(all laugh,Ash reciprocates laughing)...my dear lion will be in deep waters at my wish(all laugh)..but me and Viol got the gifts cause we looked after the young flower dream only(all laugh) whereas Dase got the ducks(all laugh) cause she looked after the responsibility mask(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “Ketchum’s been after me for 21 years for a rematch(all laugh)..Ketchum i’ll start legal procedure tricks(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well lawyers are very nice food for Gengleye especially at courts(all laugh) which they are extremely familier with(all laugh) been 15 times(all laugh) actually that is experiential i still remember the order Gengleye,Giracozma,Conhoopa,Decidugius,Banetteshadow,Rototomb,Aegilure and Glalicent(all laugh) then Mageargeist was fairy ghost combine(all laugh) then psychics were Meownown(all laugh),Celebizong(all laugh),Musharnaclas(all laugh),Uxievoir(all laugh) last two were DuskDarkrai(all laugh) and Deoxymar(all laugh) yeah i have total 30 still didn't have Metadol(all laugh) who were at Ventuariastrog lecture hall(all burst into laughter)...so yeah i have had 5 years to learn about the tricks and the persons(all laugh)..Mist as you know only too willing to be with me as ever so no tricks just needs to be called Mist plus y 10 times(all laugh)..right(all laugh),but for me at present no trick is needed at all as you can see(all laugh)..right(all laugh),ever i’m Mistyvious(all laugh)..right(all laugh),how about the universality of anatomy trick(all burst into laughter)...and universally read in between lines of adjectives,verbs and adverbs(all burst into laughter)..”
Misty(laugh) : “about the universality(all laugh),sis has eventually picked up bro's
ways and has used the anatomy to slaughter obviously
her rose in certain moments(all
burst into laughter)..but it was only sweat which of couse the most polite term(all laugh)..to which Drew told us that he couldn't stop laughing the whole week cause all he needed to say was ‘but’(all
burst into laughter) and all biases were created(all laugh)...but Drew is tricked also every time when May says he doesn’t cherish her cause she isn’t well educated(all burst into laughter) this gets Drew to loath it absolutely each time(all laugh)..anyway,so my sweet Gyarados Gyaradoses then and after that for 8 years(all laugh)...but later it was 'Mist,Mist! you're so sweetie(all laugh) just like your Gyarados (all laugh uncontrollably)' but that first greeting i told him to change in phones and all(all
laugh),'um..why would they mind(all laugh uncontrollably),they aren't you(all burst into laughter)'...then i just fled the scene of logical arguments(all laugh),so this goes on and then the
finals was crooked(all laugh)"
Brock(laugh) : " some ways to sweeten own wife of 37 years(all laugh)...man just wait don’t teach these at 5(all burst into laughter)...anyway the finals were,'good match,good match,but hey
Brock,beside May,that girl cheering me(all laugh),are you sure Mist isn't here(all laugh)',that was the common thing then he finally wins and we're from his bench can enter the battlefield where Snorlax was knackered but still wanted to fondle us(all laugh) and he was inside the pool where he would bodyslam us to express his glee(all laugh)...anyway, longing-boy of course tendered Snorlax and then the opposition who also was a female brat but fortunately married with a child(all burst into laughter)...so that went all right,and here's a note that if female brats are married with a child,the master would behave with them in those days as if they are his mom or big sister as well(all smile)...but the moment they would untroduce any unmarried younger notMisty(all burst into laughter), that's it,thanks 'mam but i've got an urgent call to make(all laugh)'...later told us,'very cute that girl,Brock,very cute.great skill.warm personally.great girl really.isn't Mist so Brock ?(all burst into laughter)'...anyway he'd beak my head off learning how i would counter a lopfinun-Gyarados in Cerulian with a meta-statrum-Corbat(all burst into laughter),exactly mentioning our types WRONGLY(all laugh) cause that’s the start then then as i correct it he would using that create infinitely all types imaginable(all laugh)..and so on,and during phonecalls the sis was threatened off as the roses will be personally taken care of otherwise (all laugh) and i was threatened that unless i behave(all burst into laughter),he'll set Max upon me at midnight (all laugh uncontrollably) which means i'll have to fondle him even in dream(all laugh)...anyway,one thing the boy ever did was Pokemons and Misty was exactly same to him(all laugh) so there were no difference in dating and battling (all laugh)...anyway,that final celebration there and then all finally with his Misty where my Viol flower was present so,the cooking is bettered(all laugh)"
Violet(laugh) : " as soon as he passed got into the semifinals,whole gym was in red alert (all laugh)...none can disturb her cause she was preparing strategies (all laugh) and all and during the match all sorts of emotions were going on(all laugh) and especially if the opponent was of her gender then that is an in-born mistake(all burst into laughter),so they were sweared in front of us and all(all laugh) but the screen needed a good wiping (all laugh) later and after the final the marks were permanent (all laugh) cause she had to go somewhere afterwards and thus was prepared (all laugh),where she went 2 hours later(all laugh),then they said all things are already over(all burst into laughter),'yay,thanks my Ash is Hoenn Champion,going back'(all burst into laughter)...by the way the screen was damaged in front of me(all laughs uncontrollably),when i tried to misbehave (all laugh) she was in tears that how could i put a dagger piercing my own sister' heart,which was too sweetened then (all burst into laughter) and that too by my own hands(all laugh)...and later Dase and Lil got the same treatment proving also that before this Hoenn Championship never existed(all laugh)...then finally videocall,first she again tries to damage the screen (all laugh) and then calms down and starts their gazing without a single meaningful word(all laugh)...then the champion boy says,'um..sorry 'mam but 'um.. Mist looks nice today but these cosmetics...'(all uncontrollably laugh)..is the first brat i saw who wants absolutely no cosmetics ever(all laugh)..still told me before the show are make-ups necessary(all laugh)..and you know none could make him use any and Mist somehow managed but then too much sweetened(all laugh)..so Hoenn champion wants his 24 year long 24 year old wife(all laugh) in reciprocrating her joy that he won the title is to not use cosmetics cause they’re harmful for skin(all burst into laughter) and then Mist is so sweetened almost went to the spot for the brat to say,’um..i see very happy’(all burst into laughter) and i felt more ashamed (all burst into laughter) and wanted to leave but then to my utter confusion the boy says 'no,'mam it's all right if you want to leave but you may stay,we’re just very happy,just the emotions(all burst into laughter)'...to which my sis again has tears in her eyes that means i don't like her non-formal husband(all laugh) so i was leaving (all burst into laughter)... that's 24th year
of marriage (all laugh and .)..but what happened during Hoenn and the responsibility
mask(all laugh),whoose best suited to interpret the mask Dase?"
Daisy(laugh) : "seeing the sketch through colour and shade(all burst into laughter)/the fox was too cunning so it took a few days(all uncontrollably laughs,tears)/rowing the Trace so why to gaze(all
burst into laughter)/jackal then fox on(all burst into laughter),young flower craze(all laughs and cheers for Misty,etc)..”
Ash(laugh) : “just an eloquent intervention(all laugh)...um(all laugh)..(all laugh)am i young(all laughs uncontrollably,tears,cheers and so on)...yeah,understood(all burst into laughter)...right(all laugh),so are you sure(all burst into laughter)..”
Misty(laugh) : “and my bee also from day one has been saying that Mist minus ponytail plus cosmetics is Misty(all laugh) which is a rather professional name(all laugh)..during hellrounds my bee namecalled me like never imaginable but then...my sweet bee(laugh,all laugh),twice took me in that small half tented cabined room(all laugh) and there took all possible cares each time namecalling and saying i’m leaving you(all laugh)...and sleep powdered each time i was about to cry too much(all smile)..then while i slept my nerves were still calmed down by the dark i don’t know how many were there(all laugh) and all..then i cry and tell him that you will never leave me just do the namecalling saying Mist and not Misty(all laugh)...then first won’t do then did(all laugh) but i was so distraught then again sleeped powdered and kept hugging and tendering me whole time i was sleeping(all laugh) and took the ring finger size(all laugh) then later told and then before i woke up positioned himself(all laugh) and again started namecalling(all laugh)..later was so dejected that his Mist was used and not Misty and for that again was trying to torture himself by me this time forcing me to take his part(all laugh)...that was the result(all laugh)...so Viol,what Cerulian is saying(all burst into laughter)..?”
Violet(laugh) : “Cerulian Wisdom(all cheers) says,too young to be married(all burst into laughter)...
Ash(laugh) : “well too naive for sure(all burst into laughter)..anyway,lets here end today’s jackal call(all laugh) and proceed...right(all laugh),see you bye(all reciprocates and bye)....”

(2 days later,middle,9,St)
Tracey(laugh) : “ well i told what the gym leader was doing and the poem is at the end of my date with the Master that day(all laugh),where the master made me cry and laugh with equal ease as he spoke about me and my soulmate’s full life including all others in whole family logically step by step roasting all vultures(all laugh),contradicting his views each moment as one moment he says we’re once only family to him very next moment it’s showed that we were the biggest hindrence to his flower nourishing(all laugh)...(laugh)..he minutely showed how i confessed to my flower and how she reciprocated at which moment and also whether we both cried or only one(all burst into laughter) and what exactly made us realize the soulmate thing while logically showing why we confessed like that(all laugh)...means if someone asks about marrying they have to logically show everything concerned(all laugh)..that while they were uttering each word(all laugh) and why the person who responds every logic in both the persons mind must be shown(all laugh)..that is before you say the word marriage you have to give a lecture on it for an hour and then your soulmate will before saying yes have to give 2 hours(all laugh) of lecture then after being soulmates again has to show everything logically to confirm(all laugh)..so i cried for like in ages and then he threatened to stop it and finally told me that i was in salt deficiency why don’t i drink it back(All burst into laughter)...but this is serious but i can still say all the while gave me instrauctions on Unovan Cilan which came to be real 2 days later and this all is all the while he showed his soulmate theory threatened to chop my head off via my own Scyther(all laugh)..then(laugh) politely asking me myself the proper textbook term of the method by which he was going to behead me by my own pokemon(all uncontrollably laugh,tears)..(a few moment later after all come down,still fits of laughter)..some experience that was really(all laugh)..told how i personally mingled with pests so that Gary alone has to overwork in the legal department(all uncontrollably,tears)..before that there was the warning to not look at his flower or talk to her or breach 10 ft circle yet manage everything emotional about her(all laugh uncontrollably,tears),(few moments later)..all the while he compared the pests in the gym in the scale of the word beautiful(all laugh uncontrollably)..and a few beautiful men came then a few more beautiful went ahead who became most beautiful but then left so then next bunch were more beautiful than the mosts but then again the previous mosts returned so these now mosts became more and the new became most(all uncontrollably laugh,tears)..accused us in most dreadfull ways only to fondle us to heaven the next,and did all this with a broad smile and with closed eyes(all burst into laughter,tears)...no wonder only the water empress could ever get any clue of this eloquent Telplocus(all laugh) but even even for the fear of losing her,Misty was assisted via Bulbasaur and the meance to sleep(all laugh),the wisdom brat(all laugh),the pokemonifification of dark Kalos wisdom(all burst into laughter) and other 35 ghosts(all laugh) while Crawdauntogator was lurking around her(all burst into laughter)..by the way his Greninja’s type is ash(all laugh and .)..his flower got all supports all because she is the eternally only sweet spot of the master(all laugh) but only in literal terms if she’s projected outside the master(all . and laugh)...this was the conclusion and finally eternalized the family saying this play will get more and more dangerous again and again but we know the results thus lets go to the hell(all smile and cheer)..with the only thing that next time the Lab will itself create a jovial Ghostradarkarrigussonor battelion and set them upon anyone or region if they misbehave even a bit(all smile),anyway,master’s main accusions was extremely serious actually...he said 1.the gym wasn’t taken care of cause the other flowers were better suited in other professions and were of kind who’ll fondle with pokemons rather than being serious about battling even if they could very well if enough concentrated and the responsibility suddenly came in so a bad situation occured but thus the youngest flower is put in a mess especially in a fearowed city like Cerulian where pests and numbered in infinity,so this is against the sisters
2.the flower thus had to take up the responsibility role too suddenly may be she could’ve travelled somewhere for another year which we know about(all laugh) cause may be then she would’ve understood things a bit better,well of course(all laugh) anyhow the thing is that she was abruptly called in with a responsibility too hard for her to comprehend and thus she didn’t realize that the responsibility was gnwaing away at her real self which we ever knew as soon as the master came around,this is again the Misty Waterflower herself that she was impetuous and despite knowing herself she didn’t play around more and actually Misty Waterflower was mostly crucified for depending upon Ash Ketchum as that was infatuation and was meaningless cause the master said he travelled to Kalos and all never being bothered and most brutally he would’ve died may be at the same time as Misty Waterflower would but she would die out of depression where as the master would die as a pokemon,meaning that jovial inhuman nature would just brush him off..so,in the end the master was in a far better situation cause he atleast had his pokemons beside her where as Ms Misty Waterflower dies alone...so this is to crucify Ms Misty Waterflower...
3.a certain Mr Skechit despite knowing everything never bothered to fetch the master in Unova cause if he at his position wanted he would’ve very easily found out his whereabouts despite no contacts in Unova and was present at () in Unova before his finals for his pokemons and then later after Undercover where again Trevor could’ve been reached cause the news went public by then and Mr Skechit first didn’t chide the flower that she was drifting to the wrong end and then finally not resisting(laugh)..beatiful men scaled according to their beauty(all laugh)...
4.finally Brock of all people travelling with him in 4 regions never thought that his version was the exact upended version of the master’s flower analysis despite knowing everything then he opened a saloon and beautified many men(all burst into laughter)...
5.DESTINY(all bursts into laughter) then a song i would ever remember this was set in a background of beautiful men as well,but it could be generalized and thus saying(laugh)..he says if you don’t know youself yet because you have some skills and so on,it’s YOUR not YOU as we know,so he proceeds,like the Cerulian brats did yesterday when they tried to pursue the Master..or certain female brats pestered the master,say that brat from Kalos(all laugh)...i’ll let the Master sing it no matter what,that brat was in Unova inself and went to contact you(all laugh)...what were the antics(all laugh)..?
Ash(laugh) : “first she forgot my name(all laugh)..’um,Mr Ketchum..(all laugh)..’,’why did they allow you of all people in ‘madam(all laugh)?’,’no..um..just said travel companion and all let me in’,’i see pretty clever...(all laugh)’..then she gets it and just asks politely about the things and all i said like that not more than a minute also informs me that she has been travelling around Unova of all places(all laugh) and thus came to meet me here and all,then starts bratting around(all laugh)..she knew nothing about my marriage but heard about a certain Ms Misty Waterflower bestowing her compassion on a Telplocus and understands that the only Pikachu in the world to drive away 16 half-grown brats can only be the one she saw with live examples of the legendary thunder-chairs,she is the eye witness of a few thunder-chairs along with those other two and knows a lot about it cause they probably don’t understand thunderbolt at all(all laugh)...anyhow so she gauges the situation and says that- ‘um..i’m sure you know about the Telplocus..(all laugh)..’...’say the name properly,’madam’(all laugh)..but the brat was clever instantly realized it and said like ,’yeah,i understand Mr Ketchum congratulations for your marriage but i’m sorry to see you in this condition...and so on..like for people of my position it was hard indeed to do both in life and so on..’,’yeah,the whole world has come to know about my condition ‘madam,the identity that got you in here,don’t you recall how i was pestered and humiliated around till the VERY LAST MOMENT’...now this gets the brat going(all laugh)...recalls my name(all laugh) lectures on not to hold onto the past now that i’m married and then goes on to praise my wife then again congratulates me on the marriage and condolences for this condition and tries to leave..but could see that the brat wasn’t happy that i recently married and jumped into fire and even more importantly threw my wife to another fire so it was rather a bit immoral(all laugh)...then i say like,’madam,if you recall your meeting just previous to this with Mr Ketchum(all laugh),then you’ll remember that a sentence was used that one must know the soul first everything else second which includes all kinds of ideas and possibilites,so after about two years i’m sure you of all aren’t accusing me of immorality.”,this gets the brat straightened and smiles at me says that she’ll always be greatfull that she had been able to travel with me and all then wisdom dawns upon the brat that if she was treated like that and she knew my life personally then my wife must also have been a travel companion and nothing else and she read about my wife and then connects that my wife was my first travel companion due to our ages and all that then gets overjoyed(all laugh)...and i prepare my self for if she tries to intrude again(all laugh)...and this would’ve been even more dangerous cause then with my situation and my trash talk level totally going full on,i decided to eternalize the brat as the ‘follower’,which is all that was said if wasn’t enough now it becomes that one who ‘follows’ those that means not the soul but everytime the soul has a human body will create the same mistake(all laugh)...this is heinous cause unless one gets the meaning of soul then they’re never going out of the following through cause their soul is separated now from their current exsistence...this i only tried in case of my wife herself cause only she could pass this stuff but about which i’ll tell you later but at that moment seeing a renouned Kalos brat,all of Greninja’s Kalos Wisdom came upon me(all laugh)...but i’m so happy to know which i always thought,that the brat wasn’t a fool but just had an illusion as many times i saw when out of illusion the brat was pretty quick witted but just not suitable for our world as can’t take the pressure and now she’s 29..anyway...this brat then tries to go all over me but the doctors and all tries to kick her out,to whom i said just leave her alone i’m fine she’s my former travel companion been with me through all sorts of difficulties for 2 years and thus has every right to stay here and talk with me as much as she wants given she tries not to physically harm me(all laugh)...this hints the brat that i don’t forget things quickly anyhow,now the brat has a threefold trouble(all laugh)...she has to properly fathom my wife cause to her i’m the saint,my wife’s the devil as we broke-up(all laugh),then her own position cause she doesn’t understand how to define her position with respect to me and then my family,and most heinously she understands that any misunderstanding on the former two will again thunder-chair her to all hells and i’m inviting her to make that mistake in understanding(all laughs)...so the brat first says ‘thank you Ash for driving them away i do need to talk to you(all burst into laughter)’...but before,Crook(all laugh)..why do i find that female brats gets more sentimental than their male counterparts on being thunder-chaired to eternal namecallhood(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “because of their grasping power of their male counterparts(all burst into laughter) being unbiasdly(all laughs uncontrollably) more than the other way around simply due to fact that in case of the the male counterparts,because they’re fondled by a certain type of Steelix(all burst into laughter)...makes them to be so naive(all laughs uncontrollably,tears)...”
Ash(laugh) : “oh my goodness Brock where have you compassed us in(all laugh uncontrollably)..but i want professional opinion on this most brutal matter that i so much love to discuss because of the eternalization procedure(all burst into laughter)...
Gary(laugh) : “hm..Ashey-boy..hmm..(all laugh)...retirement master..hm..(all burst into laughter)...threatens everyone by Lugias(all laugh) nonchalantly telling doctors of their own anatomy..hmm..(all burst into laughter)...but this is too cunning a question(all laugh) to impersonally balance(all laugh)...which simply means only a jackald fox but not on any days can answer this(all laughs uncontrollably)
Ash(laugh) : “lets be bestowed upon the ever increasing light of observation day by day(all laugh uncontrollably)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “Mist flower(all burst into laughter),couldn’t you keep this bee of yours unprojected(all laughs uncontrollably)”
Misty(laugh) : “for hiding-he’s too naive(all laughs uncontrollably)...Trace,whatever you’ve sketched by now(all laugh)...remember its’s about MY PROJECTED HUSBAND(all laughs uncontrollably)..but um..he’s so..um..sweet sweet..(all laugh)..ASH!ASH!YOU’RE SO SWEET BEE..(all laughs uncontrollably)...”
Ash(laugh) : “ universally through the days traced(all burst into laughter),’MIST!MIST!YOU’RE MY ETERNAL TOFFEE’(all laughs uncontrollably)...but Trace,once more march on unto the days (all burst into laughter)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “very easy one,i actually realized that the way to be the days(all laughs uncontrollably),a jackal must track through persisntenly perceiving the rays(all uncontrollably laughs,cheers for Tracey and Daisy)....”
Ash(laugh) : “Professor Oak,we’re not getting to the right balance(all burst into laughter)...but what exactly is a Steelix(all burst into laughter)..and through you first who was lioned(all burst into laughter) may thus impolitely bark how(all burst into laughter) by which type what has now made you too SWEET(all uncontrollablly laugh)..?”
Lillie(laugh) : “hmm...(all laugh)...Mistyed bug..hmm..(all laugh)...no more young...(all laugh uncontrollably)..hmm..(all laugh)...total retirement,stays in gym,takes homemade lunch outside(all laugh),too much booking..(all uncontrollably laugh)...hmm...(all laugh)...Mist,couldn’t you mask the honey?(all laugh uncontrollably)...”
Misty(laugh) : “too moist(all laugh uncontrollably) to be ponytailed(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “through the range of IMPERSONALITY(all burst into laugh), ‘seeing the Lilliecity(all laugh) but it was too very wiged(all uncontrollably laugh)/suddenly in reservation found my tree to be twiged(all uncontrollably laugh)/this and that gym-leader life but where are you my twit(all burst into laughter)/beat me first,just as ever,Gary you’re me sweet(all burst into laughter,. and cheer for Gary and Lillie)
Gary(laugh) : “really Misty(all laugh),this pest removed your sisters too densely(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “as a thesis,Professor Oak(all laugh),on Dr Brock’s strive(all burst into laughter)/emotional as ever,as he spoke/as his soul’s artistic DRIVE(all laugh and .)...”
Violet(laugh) : “that dense bee is the bro(all laugh)/got him out now Mist thrive(all laugh)/not at all sweet a nasty pro(all laugh)/please Mist don’t be so naive(all burst into laughter and .)..”
Misty(laugh) : “too eloquent to swear(all burst into laughter)/too nasty as a wear(all laugh)/(hugging Ash very firmly,Ash tenders her head)...i see(all laugh) my Ash everywhere(all smile)/...but(all laugh) that means all else beware(all burst into laughter)...take(all laugh) that you namecalls(all laugh)” 
Ash(laugh) : “dishing the global non-personality(all laugh)...
“yes philosophically sound and ever Violetically bound(all burst into laughter)/that brat eavesdropped me around(all burst into laughter),thanks Violet that he got metaphysically found(all burst into laughter)/Violet’s Pewterical sound,the day she once more found/ever with her abound,send him to kitchen(all burst into laughter) that’s were he should be around(all laugh,cheer for Brock and Violet)
but oh Brock,that sweet Steelix(all burst into laughter) wasn’t ever found(all burst into laughter)...”
Brock(laugh) : “we were talking about someone not naive(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “right,so the brat says she needs to talk(all laugh)...but Brock whatever we’ve discussed on naivety(all laugh),Steelix and it’s type with it’s particular way of fondling(all laugh),the major is still left(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “medically agreed(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “right i tell you all the slapsticken boots(all burst into laughter),so then that’s done...right(all burst into laughter and . cheer),then as the brat says she wants to talk,in my mind two things appear the first,yeah,sure,two year too late(all laugh),plus marriage,aww,dangerous(all burst into laughter)...then the biggest part is that if the brat tries her hand at the hellrounds to get qualified(all laugh)...right(all laugh),Trace,how beautiful the brats should be(all laugh)..?..”
Tracey(laugh) : “more than the word most would ever be able to define(all laugh)”
Misty(laugh) : “and this is my bee’s exact method to teach me of his anatomy(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “so,the beautiful brat beautifully thinks that,’yes,now is beautiful my chance..the most beautiful caugh(all laugh),the even more beautiful spit..um(all burst into laughter)..anyway(all laugh)..’right(all burst into laughter)..yeah too much(all burst into laughter)...so(all laugh) just this point a certain song will be all that’s in the most beautiful brat’s head,the more beautiful brat has tried,Trace,tried,Trace,tried Trace(all burst into laughter),tried for 2 years to again get deluged in the cough and the spit(all laugh)...so(all laugh),what would she be thinking about her whole journey for 2 years,this->

well(all laugh uncontrollably,feats of laughter,tears,cheers all)...well(all laugh)..thanks for persistence(all laugh)..right(all laugh),this was my view on the destiny and luck and all and this song was playing through in my mind and i was all charged with my ‘follow’ hurdle so that this song is eternalized(all laugh)...OH SO GLORIOUS(all laugh uncontrollably)!...right(all laugh)..so the glorious brat(all burst into laughter) gloriously says(all laugh), ‘Ash,you don’t need to worry about my intentions(all burst into laughter)...right(all burst into laughter),too sweetly Mistyvious...so(all laugh),i’ve long got over that totally as i’m travelling through Unova itself and you know what’s happeing here throughout the region though i’m in pokemons contests,but there too things aren’t well anyway,i’ve seen a lots of things and i get you perfectly what you told me about knowing about myself and thank you for that.i’ll ever remain grateful to you and remember our two years travel together till the end and that from your position then still you mentored me and Clemont through and through always would remember you as a mentor(laugh,others smile)...but i’ve got a few questions which has bothered me and i also don’t understand certain things and these has nothing to do with pokemons(laugh,all laugh) if you want to talk about it only then shall i proceed.’,’why do i find too much interest as if people can’t digest the fact that how is it possible that me and my wife actually have become so to each other..so you’re among them then?’,’um..no Ash,i talked to her once as you know but..’..i get to understand that i’ll have to submerge in the lake again(all laugh)..so i say, ‘look you are seeing my condition why do you want to remind me of certain dark days of my life again?’..now the brat uses the travel companion card(all laugh)...but in her mind the thing was that i told her that my wife was my 1st girlfreind just to dissuade the brat from making a scene in that situtaion cause i knew she’ll call Mist,so to her my wife doesn’t mind the word DESERVES me(all burst into laughter) but i’m the one saying 1st which simply to any half-grown brat should say it’s just the other way around(all laugh)..but such it is CAUSE I’M VICTORIOUS!(all burst into laughter)..it’s all so Glorious(all burst  into laughter)...actually in Kalos i didn’t tell them who my travel companions were at all just naming them and they only knew about May cause i had contacts with her there but never saw her cause it wasn’t frequent..anyway,i just say ‘look i never liked to discuss about my wife even when she was my girlfriend and no she was 1st and only ever girlfriend and now my wife,she cherishes me as much as i do and we never looked at another girl or boy in any other way than a friend or like a brother or sister or so,relationship it was always me and my wife and it has been like that for the last 20 years and after Unova we had a problem and wasn’t in good terms for some times but before that we knew each other for 15 years and so it really was just a misunderstanding and was too prolonged cause our nature is too stubborn and that exact thing helped us to reach the professional success we’ve reached but the glory and all associeted with it never helped our personal life and still she’s seeing that it’s not helping so i really don’t want to talk about her at all and to tell you one thing don’t pollute and dilute your personal life in public talking about it to just about anyone or to people to whom it’s not necessary to talk about it’,so then the brat says no she just wanted to know cause of my personality and how she interpreted it and about Misty Waterflower she saw her career and spoke quite a bit though only once she has and just congratulated us and finally left,alls well that ends well(all smile)...anticlimax stuff really(all laugh)...jackal continue..”
Tracey(laugh) : “well,in excerpt 1.the elder flowers were too childish to never try to understand the situation no matter whether it suited their temperament or not and rush like that leaving the gym totally upon his flower, 2.his own flower took responsibility too seriously and ultimately lost it when the master’s antics she couldn’t quite grasp despite for all the years master never bothering about her antics and then finally, 3. a jackal wasn’t cunning enough(all laugh) to understand anything and then wicked enough to implement whatever he understood if he did that is despite claiming he can sketch(all laugh)...so that’s the responsibility mask that has bugged him and now we know exactly why 107 all at a time being scatterd around the world against rarest legends and tigger happy idiots, no gym leader can imagine no matter what except his flower cause the master can’t but to stop fondling her as soon as she appears as the opposition and the other way around even more so(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well before my flower appears either of us will abduct the other to begin with(all laugh)...no really i mean i now realize that all the trouble was due to the brats pestering around which has been stopped since the day i returned here because of my antics(all laugh) but i also feel sad cause i certainly could’ve stopped the brats after Sinnoh and after Unova they would’ve been nowhere near me at all(all laugh)..but anyway,about this responsibility well i saw Mist in Hoenn and from the very first sight could see that she was very changed in just 9 months and no this hadn’t got anything to do with my feelings for her cause i very well knew the person that she was away from me and i just thought that this is a very strange then she takes out Gyarados of all and i was for like 5 minutes was jealous,which(Ash and Misty laugh)..which is an extremely sweet state in the hellrounds(laugh)..anyhow i was more awestuck about this whole Misty Waterflower Cerulian Gym Leader,Young Flower Dream phenomena till i finished Unova when i knew there was just absolutely no one that could stop me if i wanted to battle seriously and i by then had the power to kill pokemons at will as well but that i won’t do cause i’m not the greatest boss or the 4 dumb buffoons but this responsibility stuff bothered me even after my marriage but now a different domain i just don’t give a fig about anything cause i know my career is done for good let others enjoy their time i shouldn’t obtrude anyone except my flower absolutely all the time and not obtrude but eat her SLOWLY(all laugh)...and my flower can also date me all the time just tell the Crawdauntogator to have some fun(all laugh),by the way young flower dream as you understand(all laugh)..bugged me impersonally only(all laugh)..well i had to too personally be the better seat anyway(all burst into laughter)..but of course without cosmetics(all burst into laughter)..so i’ve just created this Sensational Sinister(all laugh)...where they see who young flower dream really is so that the name carries respect and nothing else also indicating that the other flowers are to be equally treated as their lives too are aptly projected with only utmost respect due to how unique all the 4 are which they weren’t enough before(all smile and .) as ardent Cili shows despite being from Unova of all places then also the brothers who were subtly hinted enough for others to disinsinuate it and realize the family(all .) but in all glee it had to be the loathed old bee(all laugh)..who is dreaded throughout now cause his starter pokemon works for his flower way better than to he himself and then threatens legendary brigades only to politely bite them(all laugh) and the brat bee lets his whole bunch free who themselves works as a human military only to fondle anyone even in SANITORY(all uncontrollably laugh,tears)..first nobody understands what he said in response to his flower’s most heart-wrenching call(all laugh) cause the reason is so dangerous that they will only realize it if they’re like Sabrina or they are like the flowers themselves either happy single or trying or happy soulmate or trying hinting anyone in-between is thus being philsophically thunder-chaired(all laugh)..then the bee improvises superbly despite saying grave abstruse but extremely emotional words to tell you that for everyone now its the next future dream(all .),only because it is being practised for 2 years almost now each day(all laugh) and even more brutally the bee doesn’t care about the audience by wiping off the tears taking way more moments than necessary whishpering in the flower’s ears the improvisation just like a real long time married husband and wife does in the most personal moment if they wants to adore each other via words showing everyone that it’s reality and they’re not allowed in this personal moment but too welcomed for universality(all .)..now the whole place erupts to a degree that Kalos-Percy’s beau of all people a hall of famer herself with 6 leagus and 5 Elite4’s and a true soulmate whoose nature is nothing except pokemon world all else too emotional,telling me in hospital nice job,but your wife being hall of famer,should always be together even in undercover so that you don’t need a team if that isn’t provided by a certain namecalled Elite4 head who has always been a namecalled namecall(all laugh) and she now wants to fondle us(all laugh) all the time and beaued upto namecalled Percy Kalos(all laugh) to his utmost surprize after like 10 years(all burst into laughter) that too in profuse tears after 30 years since her first title(all laugh uncontrollably,tears) as this is the only time Kalos was sweared to get the Sensational Sisters show and most brutally the last for the great young flower dream and Violet only continuing the singing so that Kalos now will have to regret for life for not approaching the sensational sisters ever before giving my most honoured sister-in-law Violet all sorts of leeways(all laugh) even if she isn’t present anywhere except home for the next 3 years atleast(all .) well atleast not in everywhere and Kalos(all laugh)..finally Unovan Cilian(all laugh) is all over the place(all laugh) cause he can’t understand the eloquence of dense discourses(all burst into laughter) cause the bee looked too childish to him now retorts in a manner that takes full Kalos Wisdom to understand it(all laugh) unless it’s sweared out of their intuitions and yes only swearing can do it cause that strangely penetrates the heart most if beautifully done(all laugh)..then finally Cerulians of all people(all laugh)..who has seen the bee’s antics for about 2 years now can’t understand how they have been so wrong about this bee and the whole professional world doesn’t understand the trash talking bee whoose suspiciously always undercovered can be soulmated by the once ever perfection young flower dream in a way that the flower looks like a sweet little child having all the reasons for them to cheer her totally done whereas the real nature is seen thus subtly hinting that via her real self the most loathed criminal can now spoil all water gym leaders to get to their soulmates or stay alone in silence and close all the gyms down forever(all laugh)..then the bee comes out same day with the flower to give them utmost homely down to earth picture of a couple married for a very long time and hours later the same bee totally decimates the internation press insinuating all sorts of insinuations about the show itself(all burst into laughter)..only to show the press of all how they too are most beloved(all .) which just gets them to quit their jobs sadly(all burst into laughter)..and the bee nonchalantly says the gym will open tomorrow at 9:00 as usual only to be noticed next day that honeymoon wasn’t included in the show(all uncontrollably laugh) playing this nasty prank yet people will love it even more while brats get to suck their fingers cause it’ll be 14 day long(all laugh) again irritating the same people who adored before telling them it’s just all fun if you’re not too interested about other people’s personal business again making them fondle us later having benefitted from the fooling around and the cycle will continue(all burst into laughter)...my my what has happened to Oblivious Ash(all burst into laughter and .)..now this dreadful meance is going to wreck havoc by his all contradictory attitude with the threat that he has tamed 1000 legendaries and can set them upon immediately but jovilally to fondle the whole system playfully to make it Safforn Forest(all laugh) but at the same time this underworld mastermind pleases and makes people laugh like nothing and very warm yet the next moment trash talks then goes onto eloquence to Noivern up(all laugh)..enters everyone’s personal space(all laugh) to swear them into better relationship or cure them of infatuations in a way that the bee is loathed but he helps which creates even more confusion and even more so most enemies praise him and then his bunch is feraligated(all laugh) and he can suddenly appear anywhere during any proposal to jovially teach anatomy(all uncontrollably laugh) and uses Elite4 beaus to control the whole system(all laugh)..simply put the whole system now knows that in one word that the bee is too old to be naive(all laugh uncontrollably,tears)..but i’ll have my sweet Mist dream in every life(Ash and Misty hug each other very firmly smiling,all smile)...IF projected out(all burst into laughter)...”
(few moments later)
so this thing bothered me and when this issue went in the hellrounds part i just scoffed that look i’ve done undercover i don’t want to hear that word at all cause none knows that more than me what you have to do there,and i gave my flower a huge grave lecture on this and jealousy as well that she was thinking i was with her cause i was jealous and cast her off when my need was completed to which i said again undercover that i cast off and went to play with uncertain and sure death being dead to the known world and by then that rejection or the break up and then the undercover life really made me sad that may be it was an infatuation after all and then i had to study to get my intuitions cleared and all and thus my behaviour then that every had become meaningless to me cause all i wanted to test was myself which doesn’t need anyone at all and the final result was Mist in that part of soulmate proving everything before about her wasn’t there she was just me myself and so on...anyhow i hit the biggest sentiment that i never reimbrushed you bike and i did that while i was in Cerulian and all a long grave lecture..now this all wisdom takes my flower where-(laugh) ‘um..sorry..Ash..i said you..were jealous..um..i’m very sorry..you..you..repayed the bike...um..alright..and sobbing and as soon as my sweet bug hears the bike is repayed totally breaks down and i know this is over i can now just marry her exactly there(all laugh)..but my sweet flower goes on...Ash..um..your girlfriend..um..she’s from Elite4..a trainer..um..she..she told you to cut..cut..(all laugh)’ so i get that my sweet ponytail could be fondled to death there and she totally forgets that she herself is in hall of fame(all laugh) and becomes the cute little 16 year old i first saw...how can ‘my Ash’ say that i’m not his ‘my Mist’..(all laugh)..that’s it about Mist’s personal life as you all know..oh yes..it’s ‘my Mist’ not ‘my Misty’..(all laugh)..Misty is a different girl so a sworn-in enemy(all laugh) as i told you...yes this all started with declaration that ‘i have a boyfriend get lost’(all laugh),’why are you here then?’(all laugh)..’um..you..um..’(all laugh)..and then wants to battle as i continue my hellrounds the occasion is my new girlfriend told me to delete the old thus my endeavors(all laugh)...i gave Gyaraodos,Jynx and Jellicent against Heracross who as usual fooled around beau counting(all laugh)..Gyarados->’you 1 legal,0 illegal(all burst into laughter),me 8 legal,4 illegal another illegal is about to come(all laugh uncontrollably),any point at all battling(all uncontrollably laugh,tears)..done(all laugh)..Jellicent,’my 3rd beau,likes water,hates certain fruits,you like water as well,is my beau you illegal beau’s leagl beau(all laugh)..what does he do what does he do what does he do(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter)..done(all laugh)...Jynx->’you’re male(all burst into laughter)...how much she fondles you how much she screams at you how much she whispers to you(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter)...then again what she does minutely comparing and all..those 3 poors kids were almost crying(all laugh,fits of laugher,tears)..though they themselves have become cunning now(ALL LAUGH)..legend the same(all laugh,fits of laughter,tears)...this is why she was broughtt by me that day(all burst into laughter,tears)..but it’s better not discussed much about(all burst into laughter again,tears)...man what a bunch(all laugh)...anyway then my sweetie comes back crying..’Ash,why have you abducted me’(all laugh)..that tone is so sweet that it’s like ‘Ash,why are you not fondling my hair’(all laugh)...then i continue a bit...then of course the rounds get harder and tries to sit beside me all time so that she can rest on my lap or shoulder(all laugh)...then much later i reject her approaches again and again..’um..you deserve a better girlfriend Ash..um..you can leave..um..’,repeats it 9/10 times also in the form ‘please,just leave me,i can’t take it anymore’...for which i have to hug my flower all the time(all laugh) and then finally says ‘no,it’s ok Ash,bye,you had been a very good boyfriend and now also cured my depression,thank you,you’re a good friend,you can leave.bye.Ash,bye’,and i see she’s in convulsions while saying this and then i jump on Charizard,’bye then’,’ASH!(all smile)..come back to me..’,then i come back and always says ‘um..please stay a bit longer’(all laugh)..and so on,and i was laughing in my head that,’Mist,i know you for 19 years,i’ve never heard your voice being so so sweet the one i am hearing now’...totally became a sweet little child who doesn’t know anything but ‘my Ash’ and wants to hold his hands and play around in all childlike exuberence with him and pokemons,forgot everything like how and what she is,just wants even the torture i was making her subject to continue to infinity cause ‘my Ash’ is back with me(all smile)...and really i’ve been away for 16,enough vacation for the rest of my life(all smile)..and the rest is everyday marrying my sweet Mist wife(all smile and,Ash and Misty again hug each other very firmly looking at each other and smiling)...cause she’s projected out(all laugh)...
(few moments later)
right so during Hoenn Mist was this great personality and i rather longed for her in all ways and all and kept up contact and increased from 6 to 7 days(all laugh),1 for Gyarados(all laugh)..no i just know too much about Gyaradoses never having one myself(all laugh)...and now i rather am afraid to go near her cause if Gyarados of all is spoilt we’ll run out of business(all laugh)..by the way i still would have a Gyarados in Hoenn than Corpish for sure(all burst into laughter)...first day,well Corpish too in a way as so many has and in Kalos and Unova all has that came by himself first thing goes all over me then my bunch,fondles Swampet too much and created a mayhem and you know their sweetness is what makes them so uniquely adorable and he has just chosen to be with me for all these 15 years(all smile) and even that day of the final 4 buffoon chapter,he was backup not around me then i later meet him and tries to eat up my hair(all smile),hallucinates me with many Crawdaunts trying to fondle me and all sorts and finally tells me like has some unfinished business with the pokemon centre pokemons(all laugh),just impossible how a pokemon can be like like that...by the way Trace,what about logevity of most?”
Tracey(smile) : “well,your original Butterfree only has passed on because of his type and the current bunch in average will go 50 more atleast i guess with of course this Butterfree of yours(all laugh) well that itself is a mistery(all laugh) being the least with around 31/32, a record by the same number of years or more if he does and the most being none other than Sceptile with around 67/68..he’s going to make the art of planting legendary(all laugh)...but they may surprize us anytime as you know best..(all smile)..Crawdauntogator around 50 itself the average mark and most probably Feraligator will show the way to Crawdaunt to add up equal amount of fun may be in a 1 and half year span absolutely atmost..we’re not getting out of here without them following us shortly or already waiting for us there and then will return together for the next(all smile)..where i’ll have to be an unbeautician as well(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “and not roam around with (mocking Scyther’s call)SCY-THER(all burst into laughter)..Scyther was the great soldier,how did you Trace fox him(all burst into laughter)/Scyther was ever ready,oh Trace why did you Snorlax him(all burst into laughter)/Scyther Trace wants to fight,wants to roam,wants to stretch/no Trace don’t be so cunning(all laugh),start battling stop that sketch(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing)...well Mr Oak Mr Oak’s Scyther did evolve two days later to Scizor who is so dissapointed seeing his own race being made HUMAN(all laugh)..anyway,so i rather was just submerged so happily into my Mist’s new kind of character and she too said she had a strange big-sister like affection for me rather and well that exactly was the mask-universal affectionate big-sister- the same mask that was too hard for the 18/19 year old Daisy to carry cause of her temperament of being just a normal person and not a star despite her talents and then of course that’s professional there was the family responsibility of course and then the lack of proper guidence more so cause for the last 5 generations the gym is run by family succession,this responsibility mask i call the wisdom mask and more precisely the Cerulian Wisdom mask cause it’s been here for ages and the last generation still needed mom and dad to work together to run the gym beautifully and before that grandpa was there emotionally strong but then again grandma had to be here with all her greatness always beside grandpa to get things smooth..so for the last 2 generations it had been that perfect husband-wife combination that has worked and not a single person all because sadly the city is too overzealous all time and even more cause Pewter with a rock gym is an extremely hard place for starters unless they have good water types like a Starmie but that too has to be strong and not be fondled with too much before(all laugh) or Viridian with it’s electric floklore is just too hard to handle unless you’re lucky to have a electric starter with stupendous potential and spirit like i had with my Chu which was an accident. So thus come here and all mom,dad,grandpa,grandma-all had talents and skills outside our profession and those manifested centreing this gym thus even more interest and it has been like this for past 60 years,my dad used to say just too much goes on in Cerulian,don’t know how they run the gym efficiently despite all the outside hazards that come in all the time...it’s a sad problem that has ever been here that this wisdom mask comes around and i had to cut that off in hellrounds the very first thing where actually that mask made Misty Waterflower of of all people to tell me of all that she had heard about those pests saying those words everyday for 15 years thus and she’ll know way more than me the differences in motives and at this may be for the only time i was incensed with the mask because of what it was doing cause the mask had not a single idea on what happens in professional world in Kalos and Unova and especially Kalos weher a random stranger CAN ask another to date as the’s just the public culture there and that date really is one and not just a hangout-and these two regions i know as the back of my hand,better than Kanto maybe and Johto for sure and especially Kalos is where i had seen full view of all anatomies(all laugh) and then i was at undercover where many dreadfull situations i faced and hence those accusitions later,and i did what i did at all Elite4 and all and i of all who was playing everyone like they were absolutely nothing to me and was a unstoppable danger to the whole system to many was being told by the mask that it’s all-knowing so i just mercilessly preyed upon it and destroyed it for this life cause that’s the worst illusion to happen to my sweetie due to illusions again,the mask was forcing a mega evoluted Sabrina character that Sabrina herself would’ve crumbled under upon my little flower almost killing off the real thing and my own illusion that the mask isn’t that harmfull and my own illusion of not forcing myself out of my subtle ego that i can’t harm pokemons yet i can beat them as i’m honest all the time all these two created the situation...so i fed some nasty ideas with choiced words to the mask on those same pestering tricks then jelousay and all sorts of sentiments and tore it apart to find how much my sweetie was longing for me in subconscious,the later was just to direct to the soulmate stuff to share my views and all..4 years in 6.5 hours was the trouble only but i had no choice i couldn’t imbibe those in her if i hugged her at the first sight..so anyway,this wisdom mask was what made the young flower dream become an ego on her but yesterday that was finally broken in front of international audience including Elite4 beaus(all laugh) to give the real sweet Mist flower version to show them what she actually is just a playfull sweet little doll playing around in all innocense with pokemons and that playfullness itself was that skill manifested in that way and the sweet innocense in that way-her Goldy,exactly..and you know that ring got her real nature out against a forsaken,not by God,(all smile),Telplocus,no wisdom mask can stand before first a mad Telplocus with another 10000 Gyarados’ and what-not trying to misbehave(all smile) and then the  great 16 strong brigade of Telplocus’ who definitely had more in backup with zero outside help but infinite outside hazards in the middle of nowhere with the most dreaded personal problems..anyway in Hoenn..um..just a moment the doll needs a tendering..(all smile)..
{Ash(smile,hugging Misty very firmly,Misty also hugging Ash very firmly and resting head on Ash’s chest,smile with tears,Ash wipes off Misty’s tears) : “ sweet sweet oh my Mist,why are you on salt/salt no good,my cute doll you need to take a halt/Mist my Mist,just say that i’m you my dear/Mist i’m also just you,so come a bit more near(Ash and Misty hugging each other very firmly and smiling,Ash wipes off Misty’s tears again)} 
right,besides is our Viol flower alright as well(all smile and Brock laugh)?”
Violet(smile) : “pretty much Ashey-boy,too unemotional for crooking(all laugh)”
Ash(laugh) : “well then i guess Violet you should be emotional and all else including Professor Gary(all smile) cause i think it’s type for the soulmate talking,so again in the middle of nowhere we’ll start the journey with a fox(all laugh),bye(all reciprocate and bye)...”

(2 days later,middle,11,M)
Ash(laugh) : “perfect crooking Brock being naive(all laugh)..so,as i was saying,in Hoenn i did keep up my contacts and my dear sweet sis was always teaching me right proposal trick(all laugh) which were a bit too costly(all laugh)...anyway,i got my second title in all memorable matches really my style of intuitive counters did get to a certain level but i guess you need to know what Sabrina of all people said today(all burst into laughter)...’hmm..Ashey-boy..hmm(all laugh)...psychic trash-talk..hmm..(all laugh)...3 Misty friends..hm..(all laugh)...says professional,imrpovises personally,makes singles cry..hmm..(all laugh)...Safforn forest..hmm..(all laugh)...philosophy...hmm...(all laugh)...Ash,isn’t that your 4th friend Misty Waterflower(all laugh)..a personal better friend,yes(all laugh)...very happy but her demand is to immediately forsake Gengleye(all burst into laughter)...and Cili too told yesterday,’Ash,all things good but atleast Sableye and Gengar(all burst into laughter)..’,Gengleye has been very upset that they had to be there disciplined(all laugh)...and Sableye was trying to teach the whole wolrd how to be discliplined YET(all laugh)..anyway that went off so had to be ONLY disciplined(all laugh) all the time so those little pests i don’t know what they are doing now in reservation now with none to control them with Gerjinja and Chu sent off and Goldy coming back(all laugh)..anyway,so i win Hoenn but professor Lillie,a months shutdown(all laugh) how that went?’
Lillie(laugh) : “Mist,it’s too long,only 15 days(all laugh),huh,15 days you know my Goldy needs more time then there is Carvanha,Tapu Fini,Jellicent,Manaphy,Tentacruel(all laugh) and um yeah,also Gyarados is too tired(all laugh) plus my Ash needs..um..Goldy(all burst into laughter),Mist,it’s ok that Ketchum won the title but that dense prick will leave the very next day(all burst into laughter),now,hmm,Lil,hmm..leave?leave?(all burst into laughter)..LEAVE THE ROOM IMMEDIATELY OR I’LL LEAVE FOREVER(all laugh),yeah,leaving,but don’t live forever(all burst into laughter)...later a months shutdown and all and yes calls me,’um..Lil..he’s um..holding my hands..(all laugh)..but um..who should confess first(all burst into laughter)...,and things like that were going on,as you say Ash,we just were so startled always at this character change...the night before was being like our big sister and saying so many things next day here’s you’re coming and that’s it(all laugh)..besides this time Mist had to contact a certain perfectly impersonal man(all laugh),who never allows people to mingle imbalanced matters at the lab and that too had to be of Ketchum(all laugh)...Tracey,what was the report(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “first he screams at me,’hey Trace,enough is enough’(all laugh),’something wrong in reports Gary(all laugh)’,then very grave,’Trace,it’s personal urgently return(all burst into laughter)’,then i of course realize that either my days are to be shining finally in the lab(all laugh) or it’s Ketchum’s Golduck(all laugh) or it’s obviously that Lillie invited our professor herself(all burst into laughter) again just after a day since last stay(all burst into laughter)...anyway,i say,’well,don’t worry things were alright there,if you have to leave i’ll try to finish as fast as i can and will talk with Professor’,’Trace,i can’t leave,full gang coming(all burst into laughter)’,this means Ketchum’s returning and so is the obvious(all laugh),’i see,how long a week max(all laugh)’...’return quickly or i’ll find another profession in 15 days(all burst into laughter)’,cuts off the phone(all burst into laughter)...’
Gary(laugh) : “i had just returned after a field day with Whimsicott(all laugh)..really Ash,that brat has got under my skin most(all laugh)..anyway i come back and first i got Muked(all laugh)..ruining a few pages so that i have to do them again then i scoff at Muk,saying i’ll send you away and Muk complains to grandpa that i didn’t Muk him back(all laugh)..’Gary,understand the personal connection’..(all burst into laughter)...anyway,so i somehow manage lunch and was just about halfway through the distorted pages with too much left to do,call comes Ketchduck(all burst into laughter),’hellow Misty’,generally will say just hellow and formally talk and you know even in formal talks so very gentle and sweet as ever,but todays tone obviously means the foolish reality is back(all laugh)..screams,’hi! Gary,what did my Ash tell you?’(all burst into laughter)..so i just say,’Misty,you know he doesn’t talk about anything personal with me,what’s up with Golduck(all laugh)’,’um..Golduck..um..don’t know(all burst into laughter)..but did you see how my Ash came back(all burst into laughter)..yay!(all laugh)..in your face namecall..(all burst into laughter)..’,’Misty,please,don’t waste my time(all laugh),just send Golduck here’,now Misty never talks emotionally with me unless it’s the obvious(all laugh)..now as i said ‘send’,this means Ash’s family and friends reject her(all laugh),so the ever formal and gentle lady directly screams and cries,’WHAT WAS THAT GARY..huh?..HOW DARE YOU(all laugh)..you..cries..I WANT TO BE WITH MY ASH(all laugh)..Gary how could you..sobs(all burst into laughter)..’,’Fine,from this to this,ONE FULL MONTH(all laugh) includes celebration but behave professionally(all burst into laughter)’,’yay!my Ash is the champion(all burst into laughter)..my Ash is now is the greatest master(all laugh)..wait wait don’t cut off(all laugh)..um..,’yeah,guest house here has vacancy for ONE FULL MONTH(all laugh),welcome if your husband has too many guests’(all burst into laughter)...’um..thanks Gary,i’ll talk with mom..um..Mrs Ketchum right(all laugh)..’,this is the ploy that if mom doesn’t allow daughter-in-law UNOFFICIAL all the time for ONE FULL MONTH(all laugh) then she’ll imbalance her husband’s bunch here via her mate Feraligator of all(all burst into laughter)first then when her husband comes alone to manage it she’ll jump on him to make faces so her husband will make a deal with his Mime(all burst into laughter)..oh yes,even then,before marriage ‘honey,Simona was sad you didn’t let her talk much personally(all laugh)’,’mom,girls are too improfessional to be close friends expecially for pokemon masters unless they are married ’(all burst into laughter)..this married stuff ever was there cause of his mom herself(all laugh)..to Ash was the same either none or wife who must be soulmate(all laugh)..then after first sight marriage(all laugh) became,’honey,very nice your friend,sweet girl’,’yeah,mom very sweet,my friend,best friend,very be..(all laugh)..um..yeah Mist is..um Misty is very nice..um..good person(all burst into laughter) very good person’,’as girl best friend(all burst into laughter),yeah right’..Ashey-boy won’t utter the word girl consciously when it’s about his Mist flower(all laugh) then obviously Oranged toffee-flower(all burst into laughter),first calls aunt mom 3rd day then stays for one month we all think definitely married and whole world thinks so but Ashey-boy solemly says all troubles are cause of appearing difference called gender(all burst into laughter) cause a jackal is hanging around as well(all burst into laughter) and last 2 weeks a crook jumped in to make it worse(all laugh) jackal first day told um..Mr Oak who was 19 to him who was 23(all burst into laughter) you’re a trainer but aren’t they too worked out(all laugh)..and crook of course knew me and was philosophical saying just these feelings of travelling and knowing more doesn’t leave Gary does it(all laugh)..and whole world knew thet the reason toffee-flower was so sweet and nice with all till a sudden kind of friend came up or even in discussions(all laugh) who if not physically present was a few meters away only(all laugh) was cause of new marriage for 19 years(all laugh) but finally aunt only said she can sleep at the lab as well and not in my room all time(all laugh)..’um..mom i’ve seen her for 3 long years never disturbs anyone by snoring(all burst into laughter)’..then aunt realized that it’s just her daughter-in-law but still another day said that well you’re not married so may be she should go to lab sometimes(all laugh),directly threatens ‘if she leaves,so do i’(all laugh),then Johto which i was fortunate enough to not see directly only by Traceying(all lugh), ‘honey,why are you so sad,it’s only Cerulian’,(all laugh),’nothing mom just give me Mime’(all laugh),’honey what’s wrong with Mimey’,’needs overnight training’(all burst into laughter),’i see,you don’t need her,you can train in your Cerulian jewelary whole night(all burst into laughter),but don’t fall asleep on the road back(all burst into laughter) and she will fall into the pool as well remember that(all burst into laughter)’..anyway back to Ketchduck(all laugh),then of course becomes formal talks about some pokemons for a bit but finally says  ‘um..Gary..um..talked with me whole day yesterday(all laugh),don’t you think my Ash..um..likes me(all burst into laughter)’,so i say ‘yeah,sorry for calling(all laugh),enjoy your umpteenth honeymoon’(all burst into laughter)..’...”
Ash(laugh) : “ most importantly professor what is it with old age that makes a pokemon trainer SHAMELESS(all burst into laughter)?..”
Gary(laugh) : “ashed-Greninja’s Dark Mystrey(all burst into laughter)”
Ash(laugh) : “thanks for the enlightening impersonation(all burst into laughter) professor,anyway,finally Crook(all burst into laughter),how was the plan?”
Brock(laugh) : “yeah,Brock second league going home after 4 years again as champion,makes me feel good,2 years later again at home with my 2nd title really best feeling...but..’,’not better’(all burst into laughter’,’hum..my bro is gonna propose then(all burst into laughter)’,Max:’yeah um..May,but that rose had a note associeted as well..’(all laugh uncontrollably)...’
Ash(laugh) : “now what happened at home i’m saying,my sweet Gyarados was playing my big-sister since reunion(all laugh)..so to public it’s the second-cousin mask(all burst into laughter)...now after my final was saying that very tiring whole day so lets talk at night(all burst into laughter)..3 nights full(all burst into laughter)..and poor Lillie who was so busy with the show had to manage Golduck of all(all burst into laughter) for a full month while Daisy was boiling with anger gym battling(all laugh)..but it was SO GARYOUS(ALL burst INTO LAUGHTER)!...um..sorry,but that was professionally wigged(all laugh uncontrollably)....”
Lillie(laugh) : “Ketchum,when is your next Dragonite Kalos(all burst into laughter)..?’
Ash(laugh) : “it’s been Percyd to Cerulian actually(all burst into laughter)..no really,Unova is kicking themselves now that i’m not talking to them after such a show and all the praise(all laugh)..anyway,so my little sweet Mist bug plays the big sister talks like,’um..Mist..um Misty..you would be busy then(all laugh)..’,’Ash,it’s alright,i can always have a good little conversation with you(all laugh)..helping each other out is ever the best..but um..Misty..’(all burst into laughter)..now i get what my ponytail was upto(all laugh)..i say,’look Misty you’re a gym leader now,that’s why. of course you’re my friend,but Misty(all laugh) it’s not like before you’re fully into professional life and a big gym leader,it’s just the respect Misty(all burst into laughter) that i have for Cerulian City Gym Leader Misty Waterflower(all laugh) and yeah about little coversations we can always have that when and if you want and i’m rather much enlightened to talk with Misty the gym leader than certainly i was when i was talking to Misty my travel companion(all burst into laughter) so no no matter how short the span is(all laugh) always great to talk with you’,now i can feel that she almost breaks down(all laugh)...’Ash..um..friend...your’re..my..um..(all laugh)...just call me Mist(all burst into laughter)..don’t get so polite with me..it hur..um(all laugh)..it just doesn’t feel good..and about long...um..we can speak for very..um(all laugh)..can speak for sometime(all laugh) and i’ll always be your travel companion Mist no matter what i do or become so please don’t hesitate so much Ash you’re more than my best..um..(all laugh)..you’re my best friend always will be ever..um(all laugh)..you’re my best friend so it’s ok..can we talk about something other than..um(all laugh)..’...these were in later days cause after reunion 6-8 months so these things went on and i just loved it cause she was trying so hard to play the big-sister role to get me longing more(all laugh) and i too was rather amused most of the times but when i felt she was going overboard like ‘such is life Ash’(all laugh)..i thought to myself,’life,hum Mist flower(all laugh)..i’m flamethrowing your life now.’ and then Trace report came(all laugh)..i knew she was talking like that and did develop personally and all but i couldn’t grasp it then that how could she change like that overnight in a gym cause i know what my experiences were everyday something new and that my Mist liked so much as well enriching her water types knowledge and i remembered the Johto days so much longing for me,suddenly for a girl like that to change in that way would either mean she was too infatuated with me or found a new beau(all laugh)...anyway(all laugh),another beau is Misty’s boy Ketchum(all laugh)...right(all laugh),so i knew her that the second isn’t happening atleast not before 5 more years(all laugh) cause among all i knew personally during my travels,she was the most gentle yet most extremely firm on these thing except one of course(all laugh)..right(all laugh),told mom after marrying her on that day last year just like you since 2nd day ‘my Ash’,that’s all(all smile,Ash and Misty hugs each other and smiles at each other then back to the same pose),right,so you know people were pestering her since she was 18 and half or 19 and i knew that however she was reacting was just to make me jealous(all laugh)...so(all laugh),i later realized that after she parted and i saw my sweet Torchic’s games(all laugh) which she was trying to confirm consulting my flower(all laugh) then i knew it more but still then even extremely firm that i knew so it was a bit strange but i was amused only because of Gyarados(all laugh) cause i saw later many pokemons and her things but Gyarados is Gyarados(all laugh)..thank god she behaved properly on the soulmate otherwise her sworn-in soulmate pests would’ve become visible(all burst into laughter) and Kingdra was desperately trying to cajole Chu to empty the whole reservation cause his biggest enemy Tentracruel was selected and not he(all laugh)..and none knew our performance background that we had 7 ghosts(all laugh) Mist was supported by an Ultranercozma(all laugh) and still we had Gengar(all laugh),Dusknoir(all laugh),Confragigus(all laugh),Hoopa(all laugh) and finally Banette(all burst into laughter)-yeah said that how can i stay at present(all burst into laughter) i said otherwise girlfriend will not face you(all burst into laughter) so budged...what a line up(all laugh)
and my support was a Giratina(all burst into laughter)..then other kinds of protection for privacy(all laugh)...Violet had Marshadow(all laugh) whole day(all laugh) then Spiritomb and Chanedlure(all laugh) was there to keep pests away from private section(all laugh) then as soon as we took break in that room i had Aegislash(all laugh) then in rest room i had Mismagius(all laugh) and then to control buffoons called fans i had Darkrai(all laugh) and Malamar(all laugh) then Mist all the time during the show and whenever i wasn’t with her had Sableye(all laugh)..15 ghosts were patroling the whole place for HUMANS(all burst into laughter)...in reservation had Samurott,Floatzel,Seismitoad,Noivern,Rotom,Palkia and Kyurem(all burst into laughter)..and Greninja was there to keep the pests checked especially the great philosphers(all laugh) who had Rotom to assist them(all laugh) still had the moving university of Seismirottzel with Kyurem to assist(all laugh) and we go there later,Kindra pesters us all over and Starmie agitated him with her psychic tricks even more(all laugh)...they’re following suit soon(all laugh)..and i’m really afraid of Gyarados cause she’s too jovial these days as you know(all laugh) but just that i chided the tickle masters saying don’t go overbroad so they hasn’t really provided Goldy with more ideas to spoil others,Chu-bro was extremely important here till now(all laugh)..and you know that last match with that kid Rob extremely good match then Goldy comes back and Greninja says in Kalos swamps that’s a draw for you and my dark masters lick him to confirm that(all laugh) to make him go absolutely nuts(all laugh)...anyway,Trace report how did the big second cousin report the phonecalls?’
Tracey(laugh) : “ ‘aww,Trace,my Ash..(all laugh)’,’finally has agreed to marry you formally’(all laugh)...’Trace,don’t be so cunning(all burst into laughter)..my Ash has alreday..um..(all burst into laughter)..said i’m his best friend(all burst into laughter)..’ and i was then talking with Ash FORMALLY(all laugh)...after about 2 minutes cause he has already learnt everything from Gary,i was remembered for a specific reason(all laugh)..so he would ask about me and my career life all very caringly most but never take my advices on his(all laugh) and rather would slyly sell them to me myself(all laugh)..among friends Ash rather even fondled us(all laugh) and always sell our advises to us and he would only take personal advises from his flower(all smile) and absolutely none else no matter where his flower was till of course he became personally WOKEN(all burst into laughter)..and if we were present in front of Misty would behave like a child and his grreting are really to all always childish like ever remining us his relations mine was exactly what he says with that dumb namecall(all laugh)..or if serious then surname to everyone in the world except of course his only ever trusted professional colleague Gary(all laugh)..anyway..’yeah,so that’s all for today then Ash,see..’,’Trace,don’t be so cunning(all burst into laughter and .),you know i’ve got Gary to give me your PROFESSIONAL reports(all burst into laughter)...tell me the things for which i called you(all burst into laughter)...’,’yeah challenger comes,Gyarados comes,you know the rest,but you know Ash,some people are pestering too much...’,now that’s something Ash never wants to hear even from his flower cause he never liked those things cause he was short of time for improfessionality ever(all laugh) even with his flower as she told me just the formality but friendly ones(all laugh) and then would be about pokemons and then about her every body and mental movement throughout the day(all laugh) but if she asks him back,yeah just as usual you know me,Gyarados is..(all burst into laughter)..if only she pressed hard then only a few things about Chu(all laugh) but Ash’s life really was all pokemons and absolutely nothing else except his nonformal wife(all laugh)..anyhow,he says,’pestering i understand,just like you’re unnecessesarily trying there cause you have no idea how to make your Marill approach a battle and not to fondle the opponent or only stupidly water gunning the most obvious so that the other whom you’re actually trying to get at(all laugh) counters with a Dewgong...(all laugh)...anyway,enough with this(all burst into laughter),is your Dase letting my best frined Mist to have some rest(all burst into laughter)..that’s why he calls me(all laugh)...to get the report on why his quote ‘best friend’ Mist(all laugh) was acting like a big sister to him(all burst into laughter)...and Ash amusingly could almost instantly pick up who is doing what with whom in both girls and boys which probably made him even more incensed(all laugh) cause he didn’t know his soulmate theory well enough then(all laugh)...but he never picked up what his own flower was doing(all laugh) and the visevaersa cause it was post marriage stuff to them(all laugh)..besides Ash,38th anniversary approaching,too old to be celebrated(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “that’s why recalling the 24th (all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “good shading(all laugh),anyway,so he also can test me whether i was rigousrously trying the hellrounds(all laugh) and at the same time what his flower was doing day to day physically and emotionally which was most important to him(all laugh) he has to know from Misty and then from others if she wasn’t telling him something and then get a full picture for that day to ponder upon(all laugh)..soulmate by all means(all laugh)..so i tell a bit,’yeah,all right Trace,thanks,take care and just tell Misty that she’s always my best friend(all burst into laughter)’..’um..Ash,just a..’,’Gary has been impersonal to you again?’(all burst into laughter),’um..no not that but are you sure you don’t want to confess to Misty now’,’Trace don’t cross me(all burst into laughter),she’s my best friend(all burst into laughter),she’s a great friend,a very sweet friend(all laugh)..um..anyway,(all laugh)..later’ and cuts off.(all laugh)’
Ash(laugh) : “right,thanks Mr jackal(all laugh),anyway,i became the champion and those big second cousin sis(laugh) talks were great as well,i was champion it’s on 27 then 28 was normal,form 29 to 31 everyday was on the road doing absolutely nothing and her busiest time end month(all laugh)...then i say i’ll return and plan from this to that and will visit Cerulian for a day,which she absolutely hates that i want to be with my Ash full 35 days(all laugh)..so says no i’m too busy now and have to go out(all laugh) for the show that i’ve decided to start..blah..blah(all laugh) can’t meet you or call you FREQUENTLY(all laugh)..i say alright i’ll call later then in the gym,etc and so i didn’t know and then i enter home overjoyed and didn’t find anyone cause they were hidden around(all laugh) so first enter and my sweet Gyarados is sweetly standing says,’hi Ash!congratulations!’,’yay,thanks,but what are you doing here(all laugh uncontrollably)’...then she burst into laughter as well(all laugh) and so on then to my utter disgust my little sis comes to pester me even more on non-professional issues(all burst into laughter) becasue she went home for a few days but then straight here with professor Birch to know everything about her big sister-in-law(all laugh),tells Trace that he can’t sketch his own proposal moment(all laugh uncontrollably),at the busiest moment with an abused Magmorter asks Gary if he has a girlfriend(all burst into laughter),sucks my flower’s head off for advises on cost experiences(all laugh) and finally professionaly inquires mom on why does my flower calls her ‘mom’(all burst into laughter)...what a meance that little brat was for those 15 days(all laugh)...anyway,my flower was at my home and i was beeing around her and she was playing that big sister role and wasn’t giving me enough to fondle her to death(all laugh)...so i was taken aback a bit thinking that is this the real personality then? Then obviously my longing was too much for her to take and suppress at that age of 24 and so one day i went up midnight and saw her standing in the balcony and just asked if everything was alright or not and of course my flower was enjoying so much that i was beeing around and got her reimburshment of 5 year effort(all laugh),so then she just looked at me smiled and said no nothing and then just kept smiling and i stood beside her then just couldn’t keep my emotions cheked held her hands AND(all cheers and .s),FINALLY(all laugh),said ‘you’re my BEST friend’(all burst into laughter and .)..she sweetly smiled and mildly said,’always’(all .s and cheer)...that really meant i’m coming back JUST 2 years later(all burst into laughter) cause there’s none else possible at all(all laugh)..fine(all burst into laughter),but then that sister pest later just before we went back after half and hour(all laugh),caught me(all laugh)..’my bro proposed,proposed,proposed,yay’(all burst into laughter) instantly but hopefully none was around(all burst into laughter) and the brat didn’t screech(all laugh)..’yeah,said you’re my best friend,do you want the reply?’(all burst into laughter),she was so deflated(all laugh),’how did you not propose her,IMMEDIATELY GO AND PROPOSE(all burst into laughter)’,’it’s night she’ll think just a bad dream’(all burst into laughter),then she scoffs and makes faces etc anyway next day whole day she was pestering my flower(all laugh),cause she absolutely had to know the reply(all laugh),because if a girl proposes it’s the greatest biased crime(all burst into laughter)...so my flower somehow managed that Torchic(all laugh)..but to my utmost dejection that someone wasn’t there in my celebration and now this very day he had to arrive was a certain once only Crook(all laugh) and this very day the Torchic was at her devastating flamebeek self(all laugh)...Crook decided that as yet his Crooking skills weren’t perfected he’ll go with me again parctising them(all burst into laughter)...first the sister-pest rather is dejected, says,’Brock,bro fumbled his lines’(all lburst into laughter)...so the Crook gets the Crooking rights(all laugh)..philosophically says,’Ash,it’s time’(all burst into laughter),’tomorrow 7:30 morning(all burst into laughter),Liverstrom,6 miles from Cerulian via mount moon,Mist will come and May and Max too’,’Ash,journey to league is always fine,but journey to girfriend Ash,it really is time(all burst into laughter)’...that dumb crook was selling his philosophy as he knew i was ever interested in short metaphorical lyrics like this so i retort back,’as you know we’d ever travel till the end/yesterday she stood alone,but got me as her best friend’(all . and laugh),’damn it man(all burst into laughter)..what’s your trouble in saying the word(all burst into laughter)’,’mount moon approaching,that’s the word’(all burst into laughter),’ASH!ASH!(all burst into laughter)..hugs me tightly..man,i never knew you could be so romantic(all laugh)...congratulations(all laugh)’,’Brock,is there any reason to believe they’ll dance again(all laugh)’,’i’ll make the brats dance(all laugh),just come on’,’the moon Brock,the moon(all burst into laughter)’..gets agitated and angry and dissapointed all at a time(all laugh)..’huh!moon or sun,either those brats dance or i’ll cut that stone in half(all laugh)’..’would they allow you,May and Max Brock(all burst into laughter)..’,this means the crook proves again why Steelix is naive(all laugh)..i was ever allowed being 2 time champ as would be Mist but getting Max in was hard(all laugh) and then on that day there was max people outside in queue(all laugh) i said Hoenn champ 2nd title two months back and was specially invited as was Mist cause all knew her(all laugh) and then May was a bit tough but i took her with me saying my sweet little sis is crying being afraid of jungles can’t you see(all laugh) she got in cause Mr Maple was in hall of fame then(all laugh),Doctor Slate got in via gym sentiment(all laugh) that was hard but i had the Boulder badge and all(all laugh) so then that goes but Max was trespassing really(all laugh) but he was 15(all laugh) so had to be allowed cause again of Mr Maple’s status which he still needs cause he wants to simulate(all laugh) shrew wasn’t allowed of course then(all laugh) and my sis pestered him on this to say that he still has a dragon(all laugh) anyway,sister-pester obviously heard of the dance and thus(all laugh) and Max also very excited and he was an absolute pet of my flower cause of ideal youngest-sibling(all laugh)...anyway,Trace wasn’t there most of the times except 2 days and was too busy  then again left just not much talks except telling me and her to marry on that very day as usual(all laugh),well infact that’s what we did virtually(all laugh) but this time a certain Professor(all laugh) was in the greatest imballanced hell in the world(all laugh)..Professor..’
Gary(laugh) : “thank god that was the last break outside Cerulian(all laugh)...and thank God i wasn’t present during Johto break(all laugh) when the jackal was caged(all laugh) first to my utter disgust Ashey boy confides in me(all burst into laughter) cause to himin this whole universe there’s only one people who is trusted to handle personal matters impersonally(all burst into laughter) and viseversa(all laugh) which i had to for 4 years(all laugh)..i give you a little of the later cause if that’s too much discussed the demonboy section is very dangerous the rest we won’t be able to truely enjoy..so later many days into the 4 years,’Ash,just one thing of my life in fact,i’ve recently been able to find my choice and has got engaged 2 days ago’,’well great news,Congratulations Gary,many congrats,wish you and your fiancee all the best and happy journey forward,alright then thanks.bye’(all laugh)...you mention one name and bust(all laugh)...but he was like that with me well obviously how he was before you know this was just to give you a mood to show the contrast this man in longing-boy phase confides in me,’um..Gary..’,’anything wrong Ash?’,’um..is proposing important?’(all laugh uncontrollably,tears),yeah exactly that cause i don’t think i’ll ever hear that question in my life again(all burst into laughter),’um..Ash,you..’,’no,no,in case of arranged marriage i reazile(all laugh)..but still you know you go to a ceremony and do say yes we do(all laugh uncontrollably,tears)..but if a heterobord-Sceptile is 3 rounds in aginst a changed metasormos-Jynx,2 challengers down,5 minutes in(all laugh uncontrollably,tears)...’,’Ash,stop that(all burst into laughter).you’re not sure to confess to Misty and of course the viseversa(all laugh).the viseversa doesn’t exist(all burst into laughter),please i’ve got work to do(all laugh)..’,’no,sorry that’s ok..but wait..now he will show you that he isn’t the one to take any advice from anyone in personal matters except Misty unless his exact question is answered(all laugh) or his confusion is logically talked about...uninsinuate in laguage(all laugh)...and Misty can’t help this question only(all burst into laughter)...so says,’wait..i’m sorry for being improfessional(all laugh),but i realized the answer you just give me your own opinion cause you know why(all laugh)’...this is true eloquent sly fox stuff(all laugh) and this is exactly why i used to say for 4 years that he’ll return,this means i know everything about you and Lil via my professional and personal contacts there in gym(all laugh) so unless you say,that means you’re not sure either which means i’m better cause atleast i’m sure and thus chides me that i myself must make up my mind quickly(all laugh)..cause to him either soulmate or single nothing else so you have to test(all laugh)...’yeah,my bad day,say(all burst into laughter)..’if one says the person cherishs the other(all laugh) and if one says that the person is more than best friend(all burst into laughter) to the other the emotions(all laugh uncontrollably)...isn’t it enough and may be better than exact words for proper cognition?(all laugh)’..’Ash,it’s 8 years just buy a ring and give her(all burst into laughter),yeah,fit it in her fingers yourself(all laugh uncontrollably,tears),but yeah,the emotion can make her do it herself(all burst into laughter).thanks.bye(all burst into laughter)’,’thanks Gary,got my answer(all burst into laughter)’....this is sadly one side and so great that it was dense(all burst into laughter),the other side was totally volcanic absolutely lunatic Gyarados(all laugh)...you know i saw her in the gym and all and what she is and now this real version(all laugh) and this was the last they after their best confession and Brock only just met us and went off cause he was busy and Misty was at lab with her pokmeons so unfortunately Brock couldn’t be confided into(all burst into laughter)..so gets me after i’m absolutely knackered just before leaveing..’um..Gary,have you ever told Lil that you’re his best friend(all burst into laughter)’,’Misty,please you two have been perstering me since morning what..’,screams,’ANSWER ME(all burst into laughter)..’yeah,fine,he said the same thing best friend and that word all emotional(all laugh)’,’Gary,Gary,did my Ash confess?(all laugh uncontrollably,tears)’,’Misty,please,you’re a gym leader with..’,’ANSWER ME(all laugh)..gym leader..gym leader..(sobs)...i want to be with my Ash(cries)..AND YOU DON’T WANT THAT(all burst into laughter)..none wants me to be with my Ash..(breaks down almost and screams)...I WANT MY ASH(all laugh)..’,’yeah so does he(all burst into laughter)’,this gets her extremely happy(all laugh)..’Gary,what he tell you?is he going to marry me tomorrow(all burst into laughter)?..YAY,MISTY KETCHUM!(all laugh)GARY,GARY,FINALLY I’M..I’m..I’M KETCHUM,GARY?(all laugh uncontrollably)..then almost eats me up,i don’t say anything cause i just had no emotions or ideas to express in word(all burst into laughter)..’so many thanks Gary you are a true friend..i’m going to marry my Ash tomorrow(all laugh),again screams..AND NAMECALL YOUR NAMECALLED GYM(all burst into laughter)...’,’he said you’re his best friend’..gets dissapointed..’oh!..i see..then returns the gym leader again..um,very sorry Gary if i was emotional(all burst into laughter)..ya,gym leader’s life very tough,but i love it(all burst into laughter)...’,then a few words..but lastly just before she walkes off again the gym leader goes away(all laugh)...’hmm(all laugh)..Ash Ketchum,best friend,you know said it to me yesterday while he held my hand(all burst into laughter)..’,’Misty,you know he’s an extremely dense guy(all burst into laughter),why don’t you..(all burst into laughter)..’..gets angry..screams..’SHUT THE NAMECALL UP(ALL LAUGH)...MY ASH WILL PROPOSE TO ME(all burst into laughter)..AND IF HE DOES’NT I’LL KILL YOU..YOU..(all burst into laughter)..’..and walked off...man,that day is my real experience with hell(laugh)..they tried to make me the communication channel for proposal(all burst into laughter)...
Ash(laugh) : “well we’re so happy to serve you personally Professor(all laugh)..anyway,mount moon two,on the way those 3 jumps on us,my flower with my Chu and Max was separated i was a bit worried and at a time was saying Pikachu might be in trouble and all and then the Crook said that Misty is a gym leader now she can look after herself and Pikachu and Max..which was a bit stiking cause even 2 years ago it was the the opposite(all laugh) well she still had Tapu Fini then but she likes me(all laugh)...so(all laugh) this made me realize that may be she isn’t liking my outside childishness anymore(all laugh)..generally my eloquence and all were with Gary only(all laugh)...and sometimes Brock through poetry(all laugh),and Trace i just love to threaten that sweet fox(all laugh)..MAR_SHAD_OW(all burst into laughter)..anyway,i make a decision that today i will see what happens(all laugh)...then,of course moon shines and those idiots dance their Clafa off(all laugh)..then i was sitting far away putting my sis in the middle to gaze at my flower(all laugh)...my flower of course knew about it(all laugh)...but sadly my sis too but i told her either i get my way or roses will be returned with greetings(all laugh)..so the pest was calm....and now hereby while i was gazing my flower,who only knew too well that she is is beeing sweetened through eyes(all laugh) and was smiling so sweetly and never looking at me so that i just go and fondle her to death..this is the climax and end of longing boy and Gyarados flower(all .)...thus please professor...”
Gary(laugh) : “well i got the Gyarados in full(all laugh)...but doctor crook(all laugh),what was your recipe(all burst into laughter)...”
Brock(laugh) : “i was ordered to mingle in the foods(all laugh uncontrollably,tears)...and that really meant the longing boy couldn’t take it and has evolved”
Gary(laugh) : “right longing-boy suddenly had to stay away from his wife and the wife found a Gyarados(all laugh)..so by that she made a deal(all laugh)..and thus got the longing boy evolved(all . and laugh)..but devoured everyone else in process(all laugh)...via wisdom mask(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “right longing boy thus was determined that the longing is too sweetly much(all laugh)..but again thanks professor cause you were the one who Gyaradosed my flower up into most sweetened mega evolution so that she doesn’t have to propose(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “or else i would’ve been starting my pokemon journey again i guess(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “thanks for the impersonally balanced personal help professor(all burst into laughter)..Magmortgolem(all laugh)..some brats throse two have become(all laugh)..anyway,now enter the 5th stange of the sideshow(all laugh)..finally CONFESSION-BOY(all laugh and .) and the one and only young-dream-flower (all burst into laughter and .)...too young to be not naive(all burst into laughter)...anyway(all burst into laughter),i was determined to do something cause i knew it was time at that age and i was in Kanto but every damn villege-city was to be travelled(all laugh)..which includes Hazelex City(all laugh) and still Frucient City(both laugh)..so i really had to again propose my 24 year long wife(all laugh)...but here enter the prototype of posterboy(all laugh)..too old though(all laugh)..but i really wanted to know whether she wants me to stay like i was or be like her,which as you now see too irritating for me to do(all laugh)...so i thought of a PLAN(all laugh and .)...so now,later via my sis i call my flower for a midnight star-far-near gaze(all laugh) and that brat was trying to eavesdrop when i was telling her to shut up cause she’s a little girl of 18,she will spoil the moment unknowingly and i’ll be so angry with her..then of course i never chided her like that before except may be 3/4 times in two years and all were because she wasn’t concentrating so this was new cause it was not about pokemons so becomes emotional then i have to sistersit her(all laugh)..you just need one word that’s i’m poroposing my girlfriend today(all laugh) and then talk about the cost(all laugh) then promise her more food(all laugh) from your share and chide her poor bro(all laugh) and battle her and let her win in a whole bunch vs 1 match(all laugh)- she’s too happy ever with these cause it’s not gender bias(all laugh)..anyway,she said a thing that was maturitity that later in our Frontier journey we saw,said ‘even if you or her doesn’t get another person,still if you don’t confess then you’ll be feeing real pain given you won’t see each other for so long’..i had to concur but i said that i’ll do it my way and she’ll know if i do and so on it went away...now my plan that i wanted to test and then confess at(all laugh)..um..Daisy,why do i find the reversation doesn’t put up enough lights(all burst into laughter)..and in a certain place why is it impossible to sketch(All laugh)..and most importantly why did the damn jackal(all laugh) never cunningly went to that place(all burst into laughter)..?
Daisy(laugh) : “well i know another corner rather a space(all laugh)...and are you sure the place was cold enough for unsweating(all laugh uncontrollably)...?..”
Ash(laugh) : “thanks but the gentleman foxed you to break the traditional custom of places(all laugh)..and didn’t sketch it(all burst into laughter)...but Professor Lillie,why did i agree to your polite lion professionally(all laugh)..any clue..?”
Lillie(laugh) : “equanimity of eloquent emotions(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “right thanks,so now back to mount moon,at night i meet my flower,again tries to play big sister stuff and all won’t give any hints that she wants to hug me back or not..so finally i realized that well i will have to test it(all laugh)...i just held her hands too firmly and get close to her,put my arms on her shoulder and just said,’Mist,why don’t you put your ponytail up anymore?’(all laugh)..first tries to wriggle away(all laugh)..’um..Ash..tomorrow..’(all laugh)...’yeah Mist,you’ll go away and i will as well,so many years,but hey want to battle(all laugh)’,’um..Ash..battling..’,’cause i’ll be in the gym(all laugh and .)..for tomorrow’,now i can see she is getting so excited and still trying her wisdom mask(all laugh)...’um..Ash,you..’,’anyway,we’ll see that(all laugh)..you want to talk about Kingdra(all laugh)..?’..dissapointed,’Ash..um..i’m not in the mood..um..just sleepy...um..’(all laugh)...’Mist can i ask you something(all laugh and .)?’...gets extremely excited..’sure Ash,um..’,’do you wear cosmetics all time now(all laugh)..?..’,she’s a bit flustered cause thinks i wanted her to look too cosmeticed(all laugh)...’Ash,what are you..why..’,’see Mist,i always thought that gym leaders should be nasty(all laugh)’,this gets her in more confusion cause she now thinks i’m not happy with her role and so on(all laugh)...’oh Ash,you’re so childish still..’(laugh)...’Mist,gym leaders have to study a lot right?’(all laugh),’yeah but that...’,’no i thought now my friend is more intellectual’(all laugh),..now she totally falls apart(all laugh)...looks at me and HERSELF hugs me(all laugh and .) then holds my hands as i already have let go of her’s(all laugh)..AND I DIDN’T HUG HER BACK(all laugh and .)..quickly hugs me and says,’Ash,you’ll always be my best friend,why are you hesitating so much,Ash i um..i just like our friendship(all laugh)’,then i just hold her hand and say,’thanks Mist,i just thought that for all great skills and virtues,i just lost my travel companion of 5 years so..’,this gets the big sis out to make sure i understand everything,’laughs...Ash,please,so much responsibilities come with gym leading if you saw it for yourself..’,’so i’m invited then?(all laugh and .)’...this gets my sweet flower to blush too sweetly and giggle,’Ash..you’re always invited just walk into the gym we all know you for 8 years,please but i was saying..’,’you’re sleepy tonight yeah(all laugh)..you can go,i’ll see what i do tomorrow i too have RESPONSIBILITIES to my travel companions..(all laugh)’,gets her so dejected that she thinks i’m very hurt cause of her new system and so out comes the Gyarados(all laugh)..sternly,’Ash,please,i didn’t take the role up intentionally,i had to part form you..um..(all laugh)..almost in tears...um..Ash,we’re talking 6 days(all laugh)..but..um..Ash..i never wanted...’,’to not sleep earlier today(all laugh)..no no go to sleep i’m sleepy too,bye’,then i forcefully went off and she cried the whole night,i just wanted that out of her and i knew she may try to leave at that night itself(all laugh)..thus the gym invitation cause i’ve threatened to go there and on the way my biggest help was again Gary in form of Lillie(all laugh)..’Mist,we’re selling badges(all burst into laughter) unless you come by tomorrow’...so my sweet Cascade now has to return to the gym(all laugh and cheer for Cascade)..i’ve told them to paint one side reddish(all laugh)..sorry(all laugh)..so next moring i see her doesn’t want to talk with me so dejected cried the whole night and all...now to my utter disdain two persons are too naive(all laugh)..my sis is a little kid but that dumb buffoon(all laugh)...to the Crook this is murder by food mingling(all burst into laughter)...’Ash,you rejected her(all burst into laughter)...Ash,are you sane(all laugh)..you want a girlfriend and have ZERO(all laugh) personal relations,what is it with you,because she doesn’t stay anymore with you you’re not happy?’,’i’m jealous of her Gyarados Brock(all burst into laughter)’..now the great Crook is in confusion(all laugh)..cause this makes no sense as i never spoke so seriously before and CUNNINGLY(all laugh)...cause if she is my girlfriend i get to fondle and even use her Gyarados all time and he knows i’ve beaten innumerable such or stronger so it’s not that i’m jealous of her skills..actually you know her Gyarados was special all the time hence has become an absolute brat now(all laugh) the art of lulling the challenger(all laugh) anywaymthis insinuation(all laugh) is something which again was a bigger part 12 years later(laugh)..so crook goes,’Ash,you know none of you can leave your goals..continues long lecture(all laugh)..and i just brush it off but finally say,’want rematch’...this gets the crook to Steelix me up(all laugh)..to make me naive(all burst into laughter)...then finally she was cajoled not to leave us from right there via Max of all bros(all laugh)..i told him she is unhappy somehow and doesn’t want to travel,sis her up(all laugh) and his own big Torchic was chewing me up(all laugh) : ‘hum,you said you don’t want to marry her(all laugh)...and so on..then gets angry that i lied to her and so on’ to which i say,’why don’t you tell her that you and Max want to see Cerulian gym’..now the sis is too overjoyous cause bro is going to his wife’s home to propose..DARING BRO(all burst into laughter,.)..no man Daisy poured cold water to my grand plan(all laugh)..anyway,so she shares the surplus of her own ever-too-much-food(all alugh) with me and i’m unbroed bias(all laugh)...anyway we’re all happy but finally after reaching there at around 2 and i say you go in i’ll go to the Pokemon Centre and this this place and i’ll go ALONE(all laugh) and have my food outside and so on and meet my friend Harris there etc will see you after the gym closes...this gets them totally confused and my sweet flower totally loses it returns and then what happens?...(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “straight comes in hugs me...’he..he..REJECTED ME(totaly breaks down)’... i tell her,’yes,told you just infatuation’(all laugh)...’NO!HE DOESN’T KNOW ANY GIRL EXCEPT ME(all laugh uncontrollably)...sobs..Ash,how could you..totally breaks down..’ so i had to gym battle(all laugh)..that dense brat made me battle as well..(all laugh)..’
Lillie(laugh) : “i still remember,later at night at around 8:15 the prick comes back,’Ketchum,why are you here?visiting hour closes at 8:15 get out.’,’um..i know but thought that Misty is my good friend and you all know me well so i could meet her atleast.’,’Ketchum it’s not happening you’ve hurt her beyond..’,now look at that brat then..’sorry ‘mam but Gary told me to have a look at Cloyster it’s very good and i’m at Kanto i want one i don’t have any full water type except Sharpedo..and beaks my head off with his knowledge how to win against Cloyster via a Poliwrath and how  many different imaginary types are there which round what condition how many challengres are down and so on(all laugh)..’ and i couldn’t say much cause the brat has fed a lion(all laugh)...means if i misbehave(all laugh),he’ll tell Gary that his professionality was hurt by a personal professional(all laugh)..this brat surely knew how to jackal people(all laugh)..cause after that 3/4 years so childish while spewing all over poor Drew(all laugh)..’
Ash(laugh) : “thanks for the help sisters but now let’s SPEW(all burst into laughter),man some fun i’ve had at my bro-in-law’s expense(all laugh) anyway to Lillie that was about professional professionality in personal personalization on penetrating penetration of precise perception(all burst into laughter)...so i get my way in then Daisy(all laugh)..’get out immediately’..now Daisy is someone you can’t feed a sketch(all laugh) cause THAT DUMB BUFFOON(all laugh)... was so naive(all burst into laughter,tears)..and Daisy most strict person among them,so Daisy’s medicine is this(all laugh)..what is it honourable elder sister?”
Daisy(laugh) : “ so i was incensed at this brat(all laugh)..and say get out to which this prick says,’um..sorry ‘mam but ‘mam said i may have a look at Cloyster quickly’(all burst into laughter)..this is heinous jackling as he wants the sisters in start infighting over a visitor who is just a bit late but will anyhow have to get out by 9:15 and it was just may be 20/25 minutes left and thus we’re being gym leaders weren’t professional to a visitor but the more dreadful thing was and why i bilieved later in his ego is that if a 2 league champion who really was extremely talented with REVOLUTIONIZING TRANSLATING IDEAS(all laugh) wants to stay till last limit 10:30 you must allow it or else he may complain..(all laugh)..it’s a double eged sword to cut both your family and professional integrity(all laugh)..this infact incensed me even more later cause i ever knew so childish and desne i thought Brock told him these(all burst into laughter)...”
Brock(laugh) : “this pest really defames people(all laugh)...told us he will stay at Harris’s place that night his bro asked him important bussiness(all laugh) who was at Frucient City that day(all laugh) which we didn’t know then...played us all..”
Ash(laugh) : “eloquently agreed(all burst into laughter)...no it just was intuitive counter(all burst into laughter)...talked with Harris over phone and he knew about Mist of course and our relations cause he is such a good friend of mine and he heard the Orange break from Kane who was eye witness to Oranged-flower(all laugh)..anyway Brenda says,’um..Ash,why did you take so many years(all burst into laughter)’...,anyway then Harris asked a bit about my relationship status,i said no just a very good friend(all laugh)..and spent the rest at the great Cerulian Water Pokemon Meauseum(all laugh)..about the history of Cloyster(all laugh) and fossils etc..told them i want to know about the last 200 years what has happened with Cloysters here and so on,spent 3 hours on Cloyster there(all laugh)...all of which was professionally delivered with my knowledge on Mist’s Poliwrath(all laugh)..no really i didn’t know much about Cloyster except facing a few who were managed by damn brats(all laugh)..anyway,i first went in and Golduck of course is there(all laugh)..so i feed Chu to him(all laugh)...then was around reservation and obviously Brauch is too(all burst into laughter),’um..’,’Ash Ketchum,Hoenn Champion last month,Pallet,this is address(all burst into laughter),that certain Cloyster,Ms Misty Waterflower 1st travel companion 5 years,please i wish to have professional assistence on battling with and against Cloyster urgently’(all burst into laughter),the buffoon realizes that all i want is to go to a certain place(all burst into laughter)..goes there and calls Mist up,who says what sisters?(all laugh)’
Daisy(laugh) : “ gets overjoyed first,no did cry a lot that day,’yay,in your face namecalled Dase(all burst into laughter),told you he dosn’t know how to make friends with girls(all burst into laughter),’he wants professional battling experience from his 5 year travel companion Ms Misty Waterflower with and against Cloyster,very Urgently(all laugh uncontrollably)’..then of course we knew the brat was just here to confess(all laugh) so just told Mist to go on he feels bad cause he hurt you(all laugh)’..
Ash(laugh) : “so my flower finally comes in and tries to hug me to death(all laugh),so i say lets go to not the certain corner(all laugh)..cause by then all fled the scene as Chu was told to misbehave alongside of course Feraligator(all burst into laughter)..if you tell Feraligator to misbehave(all laugh) then you know no human or pokemon would breach 1000 mile circle(all laugh) except of course the sinister 107(all laugh) and Magmortgolem(all laugh) and Jelliogredos(all laugh) man these three brats are utmost damn brats(all laugh)..so we just go to the main pokemon reservation are and i only show my natural childlike attitude she gets dissapointed(all laugh)..then herself drags me to that type of corner(all uncontrollbaly laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing)...”
Gary(laugh) : “man,this pest is bron to send me to transmigration before i’m ready(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “Mr Oak why is it called i was at that corner(all burst into laughter)..anyway(all burst into laughter),then my Mist flower say,’Ash,why are you here(all laugh)?’,now according to the great professional intuition of the once ever balanced impersonal Gary Oak(all laugh),i asked whether emotion is enough for message delivery(all laugh),answer was too old to be not ringed(all burst into laughter),so it means i don’t have to PROPOSE(all laugh uncontrollably)..so then,’ ‘mam(all laugh uncontrollably),i wish professionality..(all laugh uncontrollably,tears)..’,this gets her to fall to such depths of hell,she just screams and cries,”ASH!how could you...(totally breaks down)...FINE YOU BRAT(all laugh)..now first time in quite a few years she calls me that(all laugh)..and then says the personal word she wanted to say for 8 years..I REJECT YOU(all laugh uncontrollably,tears)..’,’as friend,yeah’(all laugh uncontrollably)...totally gets flustered that she has uttered the death word(all laugh)..’um..um..um..’..doesn’t know where to go and then(all laugh)...it’s better suited for my sweet spot herslef(all laugh)..’
Misty(smile,hugging Ash very firmly,Ash tenders her cheeks,head and hairs) : “um..my Ash will say it.”(all laugh)
Ash(laugh) : “no just too sweetened today after the whole 2 days i wasn’t present(all smile)...too fond to not be naive...’Mist,you’ll always remain one of my best friends’(all laugh)...totally breaks down cause that’s rejection...and all this was to sweeten her up to the absolute for the TRADITIONS(all burst intpo laughter)...gets grave,’that’s it then Ash?’(all burst into laughter),’ya why(all burst into laughter)’,then cries but tries to go away saying,’fine then you surely don’t need this drama and i’m leaving...bye..’,and then what i wanted(all laugh),i hold her hands up too firmly turn her to me no quickly(all smile and .)..then obviously go to the spot,JUST ABOUT(all burst into laughter),then give her the biggest contradiction(all laugh)..just one word(all burst into laughter) which is as according to the Professor(all laugh,Gary shakes his head while laughing) is the unspoken-mega-professional-ring(all laugh),which again doesn’t convey any SPECIALITY(all laugh),but the EMOTION(all burst into laughter) which is now being IMPERSONALLY fitted(all laugh uncontrollably)...just the word in terms of a combination of SWEETENED-INTERROGATION(all laugh) to make sure that the ring is PROPER(all laugh uncontrollably in,tears),’attitude?’(all . and laugh uncontrollably,tears)’...now this obviously makes her realize that her own intellectuality(all burst into laughter) is being fed to her now(all laugh)...so my MIST FLOWER FINALLY had to PROPOSE(all laugh)...well Gary,how was the understandstanding but first why are you alive(all laugh uncontrallably)..’
Gary(laugh) : “Gyarados got naive(all burst into laughter)..man i heard this later(all burst into laughter)..then(laugh)..told grandpa(all laugh uncontrollably,tears)..’hmm..(all uncontrollaby laugh,tears,fits of laughter)..count-a-ring..hmm..(all laugh uncontrollably,tears,fits of laughter)..then later he calls his mom that night itself(all laugh)..in exactly this tone she said.,.’Mom!Mom!(all laugh),remember Mist(all laugh uncontrollably,tears),she’s my sweet GIRLFRIEND(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits a long laughter)..aunt said,’i first thought at midnight what has happened(all laugh) then this’(all burst into laughter)...what a desne brat(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “mom says in this tone,(laugh),’honey,are you ok?’(all laugh uncontrollably,tears)...now,the proposal of my sweet bug,tries to breach the -6 ft(all burst into laughter),but i just IMPERSONALLY AGAIN(all burst into laughter) say,’privately’(all laugh uncontrollably,tears)...so the action-proposal is lurking yet not happening(all burst into laughter)thus fuelling the LONGING,Feraligated as maddening(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) as the ring just Crawdaunted isn’t naive(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter,few moments later),so you see my proposal was validated(all uncontrollably laugh)..and the vulture-killer definitely was(all laugh) the meaning of all these seriousness is to be afraid of the span of not bodyslamming as then comes proportional picturesque tickling inbetween waking and dreaming from time to time(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears)..
(song)
I’ll travel across the land/Searching far and wide/these brats i’ll concur to let them understand/the true pests that they are are inside(all laugh) 
so my sweet sweet flower without a word proposes by hugging me at -12 ft(all burst into laughter)..and totally drenched my dress(all laugh)..we just hugged each other for sometimes then my flower took me through the LONG LONGING LONG TRADITIONS(all burst into laughter)..but my real great experience was that i fed my flower by my own hands while she was sitting on my lap like a little girl,that’s the future(all smile and .)..that was sweet,though i’ve fired Grotham(all burst into laughter)...by the way,again Mr jackal(all laugh),MR Crook(all laugh),and obviously the great Professional(all laugh),why do i find that the current generation TRADITION(all laugh) that we’ve had is too moist(all burst into laughter),ever a surprize(all laugh) thus the words were never practised before thus absolute were’nt uttered(all laugh),other preparations like certain special GARMENTS(all burst into laughter) weren’t there which for the Professor was worst(all burst into laughter) cause of a pooled day(all laughter),and this question is for the obvious elder sisters that thus the other preparations weren’t there before like obviously cosmetics(all burst into laughter),rather the exact opposite(all laugh) so at the end the great impersonal Professor(all laugh),was right after all that the ring must be fitted only via EMOTION(all laugh)..but what is it that in these all suddenly suddenly we all become naive(all laugh uncontrollably),please i expect to be bestwoed upon the light of WISDOM(all laugh),so let us march on(all laugh),UNTO THE HELL(all laugh uncontrollaby)”
Tracey(laugh) : “an observation is ever caught SUDDENLY(all burst into laughter),
dreaming the Mist through Clafa dance sight(all laugh)/cunningly then rejecting her in that very night(all burst into laughter)/next day then goes to measum creating mass plight(all laugh)/200 year old Cloyster then haunts gound with might(all laugh)/league champion uses ego to throw all from their height(all burst into laughter)/fetches and rejects better friend(all laugh) to increase de-light(all burst into laughter,.)/8 years sooner finally thinks the hold must be most tight(all laugh and .)/to observe what then happens please turn off the light(all burst intol aughter,.,cheers for Tracey)...” 
Ash(laugh) : “...right(all laugh),but what none till now knows were the words after we were normal again(all laugh) cause my flower totally drenched my dress(all laugh) and then i first after that said hum,Mist is finally Ketchum then after 8 years(all laugh) she was in no condition to talk so just hugged me saying ONE WORD(all laugh) ‘for’ (all burst into laughter)...right(all laugh),then i understood that’s the word i myself was searching ‘FOR’(all laugh) so i said mutually since my Mist(all laugh) then again ghosts jumped us(all laugh) then later the actual personality came out and i saw my wife then as wife(all laugh) i said i will still have to leave you as you know said it’s ok we’re married now(all laugh) she was in no condition to answer(all laugh) just kept hugging me and smiling(all laugh) then i asked her Mist bestfriend is boyfriend who is husband right(all laugh) said as much as your girl-best-friend is wife(all laugh) but the later trouble were the pests and that age(all laugh) so both were totally bewildered anyway,Trace i’ve always felt that the traditions can’t be held in pitch dark though isn’t it(all uncontrollably laugh,tears)..but that was personal Trace(all laugh),that’s exactly why the speciality in the degree is Muking(all uncontrollably laugh)..please then soulmately(all laugh)...”
Daisy(laugh) : “no Ash,the way to get rid of the cosmentics is too cunning(all burst into laughter)..Mist always used to say like,’aww...so sweet my Ash...made me cry(all burst into laughter) so that he gets the natural state,real longing..since first day never liked me to using any makeup..ever,’Mist,um..why use them,aren’t they um..bad for skin(all uncontrollably laugh) if constantly used(all laugh uncontrollably,tears)’...no really Mist told us this so many times while getting convulsions off laughter(all laugh)..and we thought what kind of type-specific of a brat is this(all burst into laughter)..then Mist says..,’..but loves my ponytail so much,did it himself(all burst into laughter,.)..aww(all burst into laughter)...always how my Ash saw me in that first day,just his Mist,no cosmetics(all burst into laughter)..aww..Ash....then again remembers the traditions(all laugh)...aww,Dase why is he so sweet(all burst into laughter)...’ and then of course in my sketch(all laugh) this same prick appeared to ruin cosmetics by all means(all laugh)...but Ash,we know but just love to hear again and again why did you vulture around from behind the curtain(all laugh)... ”
Ash(laugh) : “cause i realized from 16-21(all laugh) sudden behaviours of certain people(all laugh)...someone didn’t remember for which badge it was but remembered more than minutely that certain after battle MEETING for 5 years(all laugh),someone remembered a certain challenger too fondly who took 30 seconds to finish(all laugh),someone was unnecessarily too caring about only one particular person but VIA mobiles(all burst into laughter),someone neck deep in work was only interested having a certain type of DISH that she forgot to eat during breaks(all burst into laughter) VIA sisterly channels(all laugh),finally to break the tradition(all laugh),someone too strict-looking-to-veil-gentle(all laugh) could be so assured of a certain jackal(all burst into laughter) that she made pre-arranged arrangements so assuredly that out of blue,to my utter disgust(all laugh),my sweetly sweetened ponytail,who needed one more week to get too sweetend to un-stammer the word ‘CHERISH’(all burst into laughter,.) IN MY OWN ROOM(all laugh),now was cut off(all laugh) away from me(all laugh),FROM ME,FROM ME,FROM ME(all burst into laughter)..that too for 2 long years(all laugh)..without a Gyarados(all burst into laughter)..Trace,(mocking Scyther’s call)Scyther(all uncontrollably laugh)..and finally,a Mr Fox(all laugh),who has never fumbled his pencils(all laugh) against a charging damn brat pink Rhyhorn(all laugh),went to a place to check a certain misbehaving half evolved dam brat Sealgong(all burst into laughter) who now gets abjectly humiliated each day cause he tries to be serious(all burst into laughter),and had this particular brat not been born i’d have 2 years saved(all burst into laughter)..but then the young flower dream or the water empress would’ve been only seen at my home(all laugh) privately(all burst into laughter)..right(all laugh) so the gentleman-fox(all laugh) went as a cunning-personal(all laugh) and which he never has to any person but here was fumbling strangly on a calm and gentle DAY(all burst into laughter,.s)...thus the service(all laugh and .)...by the way,you know how much hurt i always am that i did what i did not knowing the right ways and losing my nerve at first sight of danger,rather doing the opposite which i was to egotistic about at that moment,that was needed to me cause unless a professional i knew what impersonality would turn into,especially given how pestered(all laugh) that was in my own moment of magic with my own magical flower dream and on the other way around the same that professionality was the thing that was being searched since day one due to the location of the place(all laugh),which by-the-way has some certain darkly pests(all laugh) now even via press(all laugh) to keep any legendary pest too far away like found-that-factor-again-beau-Pesry(all burst into laughter),though the other way around has regrets the lack of wigs(all burst into laughter) and hence was too caring about them in the process to the show(all laugh)..then there was the man without whoose presence in my life i haven’t still started my jouney yet,i regret it the most simply due to professional reasons and nothing else even if that’s the other way around but still by logic it’s true,i wouldn’t have needed to sustain absolutely any of the mental plight that i did for 5 succedeeding years if i wasn’t that retarded then and did things in the right way that was by means of a privately abducted toffee-flower dream(all laugh)...toffee-flower(all laugh)...right(all laugh),though professionally to my utter disgust that my first gym challenger Steelix now needs bribing(all laugh) and on the other way around it has ever been obvious to the absolute during breaks(all laugh) but the biggest trouble again as ususal was a naive jackal(all laugh) who was really out of bushes during sentimental days(all burst into laughter) cause he was all along the days(all laugh) situated right in the centre of the storm created only due to my ignorence to the process of abduction(all laugh) and given the jackal,he really needed to fox up cause of his family in a sense was up in blows and he would’ve fumbled his lines just what would’ve happened the other way around had he not been persistent cause every day it was a mess due to the confusion and thus the days given the days could’ve lost sight of things and do something that would’ve just busted the whole place had that persistence not been there cause the gentleness of the days could ever only fully manifest the days by sentimental days to the jackal(all laugh) to get the right relief to get gentle the next day(all laugh)..the jackal had to bear being the emotional wasteper basket(all burst into laught) as the papers weren’t blank(all burst into laughter) and this is exactly why DaivyDaisyl(all laugh) is such an easy target(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “this pest even forced me to listen to his Mistcalls(all laugh) to rile me up even more(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “as a token of gratitude for the Cascade(all burst into laughter)...but now i laugh at things that why didn’t i use my soulmates to get to my soulmate given the professionality that i was connected to,it was just the most simple matter of abducting Goldy via professionality and familiarity of Glalie(all laugh) and beauty(all laugh) in mixing with Crawdauntogator(all burst into laughter)..ah the beauty(all laugh) and which was professionally possible given the misundersting over the actual reasons which only this Lab could find out but didn’t then and thus due to Goldy’s nature it should’ve been tested and would’ve been testest if insinuated(all laugh) cause i knew the connection for sure intuitively and then it was a matter of time that Goldy as usual would’ve created a havoc here(all laugh) and i had to be called cause none else in the world could’ve stopped that situation(all laugh) as now it’s being obvious(all laugh) though both their and my sweet master now knows the controlling methods(all laugh) but now to my utmost delight our sweet master has to finish matches too quickly(all laugh) and play with us too sweetly all the time(all laugh,.)..so thus my endeavors up till now with my 107 soulmates(all laugh and .)...by the way how is your and our Magmorter(all laugh)..?”
Gary(laugh) : “mine never found any water to mind(all laugh) since the day the lab got Feraligated(all laugh) and ours was chided again as usual but i guess you’ll now have the whole lab Ash really(all .)..sadly including ours too may be(all burst into laughter)..Magmorter for sure(all laugh)..but yeah i just think that fearows are too close to settle down and that would be a serious issue(all laugh)...Infernape says those brats can’t be handled at all(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “well the Lord will handle then(all burst into laughter)...no the 20 fearow brigade with all sorts of variety in age and size,i don’t quite get their leader’s language but i’m just hopefull that they are happy and all but really Gary would they allow you?”
Gary(laugh) : “they have to cause else we’ll insinuate(all laugh) the most obvious via the Lord(all laugh)...really Ash,all balls are in their courts now reagarding fearows at least and grandpa just is in the moon says it’s professional stuff the exachange of Chu and fearows(all laugh)...but really if Lugia of all chooses a public area like this then Ash and Oak Lab isn’t being forgotten ever in history till the name pokemon is associeted(all smile)...but they’re not coming to Cerulian ever for obvious opponents(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “but Trace seriously,do you have enough area if they decide to come down permanently it’s only to mingle with my gorup(all laugh)..and how about the protection and equipments as well finances too it’s a huge thing now never heard except Rofter Lab 86 years back and they weren’t my bunch so that 2 month now may become 50 years...”
Tracey(smile) : “same thing just too much continuous landmass and if they says something it is the obvious.protection and all else no matter as you know Kukui Lab of all is ever there and then Birch,Naomi lab too and  3 others so we’ve got 6 labs among the top 10 thus majority among those of our type and given those Unovan methods are now being known,it’ll be easy to handle things for sure...finances is all yours(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “well apart from eloquence(all laugh), to be honest Violet has created a bigger sesmic effect once more(all laugh) cause Persy-beau(all laugh) is a too well-known name in Hall of Fame and i myself have faced her and know how good she is in battling and as far as i gauged she isn’t someone to stay silent(all laugh)..she finally realized my grivance perfectly and called me twice today(all laugh),spoke with Mist too,and yeah i mean she realizes why we want to keep the distance but just said that finally wisdom has dawn upon her(all laugh) and she’ll see what her poor lackey(all laugh) does to get things right in the Kalos-Unova group given the riches in Kalos and that might be shared(all laugh)...Persy of course is over the sun(all laugh)..wants to battle(all laugh) my sun(all burst into laughter)...yeah told Mist that both the couples want a full three on three(all laugh) when time comes and all and both of us happily agreed cause i’m Crawdauntogated(all burst into laughter)..no really i dragged them for 2 to 3 years all of them to battle and of course were so unhappy(all laugh)...they have forgotten that like (laugh)i guess i too have as well(all smile and .)...so my post is that of flower-husbanding here(all laugh,.) and my gross payment is better not discussed(all burst into laughter)...yeah cold weather(all burst into laughter)...anyway,so my flower gets right things more so it’s fun really plus there’s something more that Daisy knows very well about certain curtains and setas(all laugh),Telplocus itself has created a big wave..i guess we finally have Kalos of all places(all laugh) to dawn upon us again and no if that region can be mixed then we won’t need these brats at Kanto as long as finances are needed and in the current Elite 4,Persy is  the only sane person and is really kicking himself only because he himself couldn’t be there beside me and you know with a legend himself like Persy that was his biggest thing that he is being bounded by responsibilities and wants freedom but now has got the beau as well(all laugh),who is of similar type...though i told Persy and Samantha,his beau that don’t jump into fighting legendaries out of blue as you very well understand tha you need a lot lot more assistance with technologies wich i will never need so it’s better that you keep your heads to which they happily agreed but told me to remind them frequently per day(all laugh)...they battle each other 4 times a day(all laugh) when they get the time and they are 12 on 12(all laugh) but sadly at the same time(all burst into laughter) and thus each match is about just rushing towards(all laugh)...anyway, i have a real realtion with Kalos EXCEPT(all laugh) the glorious(all laugh) and you all know what would happen if the full collaboration is done,may be even interbreeding can produce something great big possibilities if the Labs too follows suit though there i have my doubts cause you know that’s the only place that just doesn’t bother about the rest and the Gym Leaders are just too happy to learn the outside world strange place outside our profession such great place for learning but our profession is so shielded but one thing is that both male and female brats if unmarried is dangerous there(all laugh)..just too frivolus unless they are INTELLECTUALS(all laugh)...i only ever faced whom i could out of schedule during Elite4s to get the grades and the regular hall of fame and others completed but the gym leader group not much cause i only visited them and due to my antics in Kalos they didn’t want to pollute their gyms(all laugh)..but a few people i really would have been honoured to face like Rick Curter in Numreg City at Hoenn being my biggest dream match that i couldn’t get especially given the grass-rock types and all so yeah Mist also barely have had many of those matches and should only get those 3 days a week(all laugh)..but again you understand my position in all senses(all laugh)..but Daisy can i keep Magmorters here(all burst into laughter)...and also given nests,what are gurdians saying about starters(all burst into laughter)..?”
Daisy(laugh) : “Ketchum(all laugh),if those brats nest upon my dolls(all burst into laughter)..i’ll show Kalos recipes(all laugh)..and Magmorters(all burst into laughter)..just throw those pests into the ocean(all laugh)..never thought Magmorters of all wants to fondle everyone now and yet one wants to battle everyone cause he was promised a match against Bulbasaur(all burst into laughter)..yeah that’s how those were recuited(all laugh)...and you know who Feraligated this(all burst into laughter)...”
Lillie(laugh) : “and one obvious brat was trying to appease Muk today with un-noble intensions(all burst into laughter)..this in front of Ketchum(all laugh) who was enjoying my poor lion’s plight(all burst into laughter)..but Ketchum get rid of these Magmorters immediately(all laugh),they are being guided to certain pokeballs(all burst into laughter)...plus how did that brat fly from Braunstrom Villege to here(all laugh)...Ketchum i warn you(all laugh)..if that brat uses the rout to fondle Gili(all burst into laughter)..we’ll start legal procedures(all burst into laughter)..i guess they helped you Ash didn’t they?”
Ash(smile) : “yeah i guess,well Telplocus could’ve come as well had they not been threatened(all laugh)...Nivy,Palkia both tells me that they were the ones to help them get to the hospital and pokemon centres,i did spot Lugias but they are very rare in Unova and yet most spotted legend in the world and those 103 was so much above Lugia that those buffoons just let them off cause the others were equaly strengthened though type different but that’s exactly why they are legends that they gives respect to each other unless swellened up and all their fights among equal types are either serious cases or infighting and Rocket’s Arceus vs Mewtwo was the first case and thus they thought they are so rare legends and then totally intoxicated just let them go as they aren’t infighting then so Lugias were spared as well as those Telplocus group as well i guess cause if you have a Xormnuh you just don’t need anything else at all so the poor birds(laugh,all laugh and shake their heads) were spared and may be the one i faced somehow sensed things cause i was back at Unova in 2 months or even less so he might’ve somehow recalled me and then somehow got me out of there,well only legendaries could too i guess anyway Nivy surprisingly was least damaged and he tells us they were carried to human inhibitations in islands...so i guess it was the legends and somehow they learnt it from Nivy as well by then about things cause as you know too many spottings of Lugias were happening who were very friendly to my bunch and all...somehow got a clue and then when this group visited Charizard valley cause of that group was created by such abused and the treated Lugias they were roaming around everywhere,so the valley was where they naturally went,i guess it was may be those who showed the was cause as you know a few came around here many times and then our beau is there(all laugh)...who was never allowed to come here again cause none of my group liked her since that first visit(all burst into laughter)...but she did come quite a few times till the forest to see off(all laugh)..so certainly knows the rout and somehow they think this is safe cause to them my bunch is good and all that...a few fondled Trace though(laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “i’m scared now(all laugh)...but that’s SO GLORIOUS(all laugh)...really that bug has bitten me today(all laugh)...”

Violet(laugh) : “Mantinally agreed(all laugh)...anyway,about your endeavors pester-bro(all laugh),how did you get my news from undercover(all burst into laughter)...sure Cilans aren’t Lugias(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “via whom we were covering(all laugh)...a brat came up to help us,she was told to extract supplimentary newes(all laugh) to appease us(all laugh)..she was too happy to do that and that itself was the reason why we made her an absolute pet and ultimately she was the safest as all of us know her too well(burst into laughter)..yeah,big fan(all burst into laughter) well obviously(all burst into laughter)...not from the first day though(all laugh)...since you focused on your biggest strength more...loves singing but absolutely anything else is heinous cause they don’t show the might of the bias(all burst into laughter)...and you know your songs would appease her given her comrade and lackey(all burst into laughter)...can sing too,heard humming two(all laugh)..to the obvious two(all burst into laughter)..yeah even rockets were launched at you(all burst into laughter)..but professor your un-impersonal pool day(all burst into laughter)..”

Lillie(laugh) : “and obviously if traditions werent enough(all laugh),the quote obviously was(all burst into laughter)...but he snatched away the specially kept wigs(all burst into laughter)...but then grandpa was told(all laugh)..personal jackal(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “that was some experience(all laugh)..i told Professor that Gary has confessed finally to Lillie atlast(all laugh)..’hmm..(all laugh)..long longing prolonging to be now belonging..hmm...(all laugh)..’..that was something(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “and the jackal confessed then as well said finally that age(all laugh)...”
Brock(laugh) : “well still way better cause wasn’t on the spot(all laugh) and my dress was ok but not in a dry place(all burst into laughter)...and the worst possible thing is that the little brat involved my whole family in the canvas(all burst into laughter)...so that my already too drenched moment was public(all burst into laughter)...that brat really got under my dishes(all burst into laughter)...”
Violet(laugh) : “well,i still remember(all laugh)...we were getting to traditions when emergency reaches(all laugh) VIA Foster(all burst into laughter),who invites me in urgency(all burst into laughter) VIA water pokemon sentiment(all burst into laughter)...we go in then of course there’s mom(all laugh),first thing,’heres your ring’(all burst into laughter)...that brat postponed our tradition(all burst into laughter)..”

Violet(laugh) : “the only was too artistic to be not naive(all burst into laughter)..though that Magikarp only misbehaved cause i left so suddenly(all laugh uncontrollably)...thank God i wasn’t here(all laugh)..”

Lillie(few moments later,laugh) : “well,we obviously knew what the brat was upto so thus they return at midnight(all burst into laughter)...and that brat exactly wanted it,told Brock he will retun late,and then Brock inquired and we told he’s busy(all laugh)..so they didn’t do much Brock just laughed and said must be a new novel(all burst into laughter)...and May was obviously dissapointed that she wasn’t consulted about the cost(all burst into laughter)...no really Ash,she was such a sweet and innocent little girl and Max too..just made themselves feel at home despite Mist being not emotionally all right and Brock being all over the place..called us big-sisters knew about the show and all adorable little kids both were.(all smile)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well,we have to consult the rose for the continuity now(all laugh)...anyway,we both obviously were just lost in each other’s presence as if that can be described best in words the feeling we shared and was very happy,i told her that i’ll stay tomorrow here too and all that,but sadly a Crook(all laugh)..decided to call at midnight(all laugh),’Ash,congrats man..finally married(all burst into laughter)..so,you’re settling here then(all burst into laughter)..’ and so on,to whom i say yeah may be like 11 years later(all laugh) and ironically it was exactly that but anyway,the whole world as usual gets to know(all laugh)...but before that what was confided to to my elder sister-in-laws?”

thought about the thoughts that appears as thoughts in our little Zion about the issues that his dad faces at this age(all burst into laughter)..Cili says,be professional(all burst into laughter) and Jane now immediately says,’SCRAFTY(all burst into laughter)’..so Cili is ever at bay(all laugh) anyway,at Unova everyone wanted to be my travel companion of course(all laugh) in Frontier already craze was there but from before it was BOOKED(all laugh) then in Sinnoh we said we’re too old thus the starters(all laugh) and then of course went to Professor Kukui and lady Dawn was there trying to drag Professor Kukui with her(all laugh) so spoke a bit realized too sweet a girl but the ladiness is hindering her EXPRESSION in reality(all laugh) so she was there but Unova was i was all alone to start and Sinnoh was that all wanted to come with me except McShin(all laugh) McShin was doing what he does at Elite4 winning everything(all laugh) and then Dawn was there at Sinnoh but at Unova the craze was too much i directly contacted the Elite4 there(all laugh) told them Brock’s details give me a similar figure with best name(all laugh) cause i’ll be busy(all laugh) and comes Cili’s name and you know why(all laugh) and he is 2 months younger to me Gym leader training 3 years then 4-5 months as leader never wanted that too much fondling(all laugh) then 2 years breeder’s study then went out Unova then came back 8/9 months took charge for few days at gym again then went out to Kalos again for 2 years then returns again goes out to Orange(all laugh) came back and by then already was an encyclopedia(all laugh) and then said no once more Unova then i’ll settle down only(all laugh) and you know dragon specialist breeder cause to Unova pokemo means dragon(all laugh) he is as big a name at Kalos and Kalos-Unova knows him just by his name now too much in demand knows every specis and the breeding techniques huge knowledge and used to study and talk and do so much now says yeah man 300 and 72 gave me the knowledge that i would’ve never got but you scare people(all laugh) i said Cili you’ve not been to Huntelion middle so(all laugh)..then anyway the breeding department was there and they say Cili is a budding name already travelled Unova and Kalos twice in gym leading and breeding sections and still just returned from Orange again after a year and is going to Unova again(all laugh) i realized just that age(all laugh) and contacted and immediately realized great man and then met him there and Iris being Iris was already on the move(all laugh) was at Cili’s gym and from there came in with Cili and then we went infact Iris and Cili decided to travel together cause both were overzealous then first thing happens Noivern(all laugh) then Dragonite and Naganadel then Rayquaza,Palkia,Goodra,Hoopa(all laugh) by then Iris was solemn(all laugh) and Cili said you will spoil our careers as well(all laugh) Cili infact says you wasted my one month man i had to settle down mentally after 2.5 years with you(all laugh) anyway,Cili is a great mate ever was but then not this close like Harris son and Kane darling(all laugh),Braumy manual and Tony boy(all laugh) but still great travel companion and friend by all means but Dawn and later Iris were totally different to May and Mist both for sure but that’s because both are my family(all laugh),Iris was hardcore professional and it’s been 6 years and i haven’t seen or heard from her only contacted once before undercover after i broke-up but that was that was alright taking rest at home after the madness(all laugh) but then i went under the cover and since didn’t feel like it and you know my number of contacts(all laugh) and actually it was good cause she needed to settle down(all laugh) and i realized it she rather fled the scene(all laugh)...Unova was Iris’s 4th region much much matured than little lady Dawn for sure(all laugh),did Kanto first,Cerulian very first gym and Mist was there for the match(all laugh) and that was Mist’s very first month in-charge(all laugh) i just left for Hoenn and Iris came in(all laugh)..well during Johto break i didn’t go to Cerulian may be even for 1 day cause both me and Mist knew we will be hindering each other then(all laugh)..and the jackal was there but i know the jackal said,’yeah went to Cerulian Misty’s sisters there very nice and good persons her eldest sister is so nice,anyway(all laugh)’..so Mist and me both knew the brat was in that age(all laugh) and Mist said i still remember,’Daisy isn’t easy at all(all burst into laughter)’..and then we both said we’re best friends(all laugh)..anyway,so Mrs Skechit(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “well Daisy had to be Daisyl else the jackal would’ve first day discussed settlement issues(all laugh) cause both were in deep sea at our careers(all laugh)..but yeah eternal connection to my jackal meant just 10 months familiarity that too not frequent cause of profession and then the mask(all laugh) still was enough for me to say hust look after your baby Gyarados-in-law(all laugh) who was spoiled beyond limits i realized(all laugh)..and Trace said no ‘mam(all laugh) they like..um..(all laugh)..they like their friendship that is(all laugh)..so well atleast Lil was first then Viol then me the order of marriage was maintained but the Gyarados was first and last(all laugh)..”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “because your hubbies are wicked(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well that is for sure in reverse scale(all laugh)..anyway,then Iris took 2 years at Kanto,one month at home in Unova of course(all laugh) then returned to Orange and again 1 years then one month break then went out to Kalos of all places(all laugh) got only a Salamence though(all laugh) and Zygarde yeah(all laugh) and Cili has a Dragonite and a Goodra as well(all laugh) just so naive(all laugh) like our Shiftree(all laugh) and others of course Crawdauntogator too many we have here and Blastoise and Snorlax as well(all laugh)..Magmortgolem(all laugh)..anyway,then Kalos for another 2 years and then finally to Unova then Hoenn and that was it for her...came in she was 22 and went still upto 27/28 i guess but settled down now as i heard...wish her best always as ever,was a very good professional and a true good person she is and all those hazards never went too much about it always balanced just told me to keep a check on ego cause it may harm my bunch that’s all..pretty good girl she is...finally did get the Hoenn league victory absolute more than deserved but decided to settle down exactly there as Cili said just all was too much for her for 12 years...still in profession of course very much husband too i heard two time grand conference...all the best to her but now lets return to lady Dawn(all laugh)...she was exact opposite to May but was not like Iris and extremely ladied up(all laugh)...she’s like first thing,’what are you gifting to your Girlfriend(all laugh)?’...i of course mentioned my girlfriend isn’t in my profession(all laugh)..met in a small competition years ago with GRASS TYPES(all burst into laughter)..beat me in the semis(all laugh)..then instantly the longing and so kept in contact..now in a big corporation(all laugh)..too intellectual(all burst into laughter)..the crook was trialed before(all laugh)...but then the Mist catches a bit of cold and has fever,i told the crook alright i’m talking why tell this lady brat(all laugh)...she’ll pester me to buy everything she sees(all laugh)...anyway crook was on top of his philosophy then(all laugh)...Brock’s days ever was 5 hours of sleep as me no matter what,wakes up unnecessarily excercises despite knowing we have to walk 600 miles that day itself(all laugh)..then fondles the whole world(all laugh)...then studied at night and all..knew everything but sadly as crooks do philosphically(all laugh) in that feeling(all laugh)..Mist ever slept half an hour or 45 minutes more than us to 5:30 or 5:45 and i loved it so much(all laugh)...such cuteness(all laugh)...and it was gladly reciprocated(all laugh)...my sis same 5:30 or 5:45 hours but wanted to nap at noon for an hour more cause ever ate too much in lunch(all laugh)..lady Dawn barely slept whole day(Brock laughs)...too much ladiness(all laugh)..anyway,crook tells lady Dawn that Mist isn’t ok so i get in the i say why tell her and all then she hears and threatens us to say or else she’ll call police(all laugh)..i say nothing just a little cough that’s second cousin(all burst into laughter)..crook screams,’NO,HIS DREAM,HIS HEART is in her last breaths(all uncontrollably laugh)’...then lady Dawn is so sorry about my wife(all laugh) but i manage all...Brock really realized that he wants to become a doctor rather than a breeder and all...Sinnoh was a great journey as friend-boy(all laugh) with girlfriend-flower here(all laugh)...then that final(all laugh)...”
Daisy(laugh) : “that was something..i was very happy to hear but to me it always has been that he was just show-off and Mist was on the moon since we saw that last thunder-chair ever legendary..and the commentators couldn’t believe it either that 1 against 8 and the best shot at the last...then thunder-chair i hardly knew Mist didn’t our Viol flower told us VIA Mantine(all laugh)...Lil had ever supported Ash among us since she was mouthed off that trophies are 10 years flowers 10 minutes(all burst into laughter)...Lil said yeah the kid has something now his 4th..and Viol was well(all laugh) then Mantine classes drained her totally(all laugh) and the other things the 10 years to that way and so on(all laugh) meant greatest caring greatest husband(all laugh)..anyway how was that thunder-chair Mr and Mrs Slate?”
Violet(laugh) : “better first(all laugh)...well i heard the news and by the way what about the screen(all burst into laughter)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “too moist(all laugh)...but not damaged(all laugh)...thank god Battle Frontier doesn’t air(all laugh)...cause if McShin cup was shown for both McShin and our baby Gyarados(all laugh) none of the screens would’ve remained intact(all laugh) and still this version was already girlfriend so more saturated(all laugh) but Tyranitar didn’t agree(all laugh)...”
Violet(laugh) : “thank the cosmetics-killer(all burst into laughter)...by all means(all laugh) and beings(all laugh)..well Tyranitar says the same everything is wrong how to live and cosmetics are then(all laugh) anyway,i saw a replay knew the thunder-chair never knew anyone can do that though(all laugh)...was a great sight but Ash,i owe you a Mantine(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “well as you know water is ever Feraligated(all laugh)...how is he though?..”
Tracey(laugh) : “went there was like,’um..can you swim like me in air(all laugh)’...as usual art of Mantinal swimming(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “well looking at the time i guess we should do this later..bye(all laugh and reciprocate,bye)...”

(2 days later,night,middle)

Brock(laugh) : “well the sermon if delivered before my heart wouldn’t have been permanently damaged(all laugh)...i was shocked to see all 9 go down so easily and yeah they did take things strangely too much too easy and whole tournament was so good then suddenly wasn’t interested on final which was as we know cause they were dissapointed to return back to home without food again after this(all laugh) well Trace is there though ever(all laugh) and Mr Oak Mr Oak and fortunately i didn’t have to see that Tyranitar phase on hand thank God for that(all laugh) and the initial joviality as well(all laugh) i knew what they were doing both of my comrades tried to feed me to them on weekends i said please man i have had to deal with the main brat on hand for 11 years(all laugh) with the schedule and questions and what not then there was his Gyaradosy wife,then little sis costly(all laugh) even her rose in the end asking for travel necessities from the point of view of a husband on probation(all burst into laughter) then his littler bro in law who was brainwashed by both big bro and little big sis as the opener of the door to that feeling(all burst into laughter) and then finally lady Dawn(all laugh) who chided me left and right one moment next moment asked about all sorts of things regarding pokemons then jumped onto the fact how to differentiate between feeling of longing and emotion(all burst into laughter) this was directed by her wise old bro to ask to her uncle bro(all laugh) so really i said man,enough for one life(all laugh) and then back to the match,Chu ever had great self heal but never had thunder chair none did infact Luxray included cause you know Ash’s methods(all laugh) only the expansion to surpass the bondage of being(all laugh) so no attacks are learnt out of ordinary and the mind is unique in opposite hence none ever got what he wants and his bunch like Muk and Snorlax and later Feraligator(all laugh) anyway,then Chu gets in Ash never told about thunder-chair to me though i knew a bit cause he wasn’t sure himself and just told me that Chu has got very powerfull and that’s all and it was tested the day before only so he wasn’t sure and he never wanted to speculate before matches so that he may push them too much by expecting much and thus they may get injuries and so on...i was really excited as well cause i knew this will be my last moment seeing him battle after going through the whole journey cause i knew that’s my last journey and next 4 years will be just too busy and then the work may be for 2 more and by then his career would possibly be over cause he had only 2 left and if he fails in this match then that’s it really cause he isn’t getting the tag and thus he may immediately look to settle down cause already was a 3 league champion though i knew he would atleast go to Unova cause was talking about it in the very last parts just for the challenge...so really i was is a nostalgia as well as excitement my own carrer prospects it was a turning point of my life and so happy i was that past,present and future all looked so bright(all smile)...so i really was observing closely what he does and he was way more matured as i told you and did wish us both and all and he just ran through till the final and was all so exciting cause he might’ve staged an upset but before final he was infact being counted as favourite cause of his style and his opponenet was not so good till final but he was only an upset-monger cause the opponent was..(all smile)”
Ash(smile) : “ Mr Nigel Traumstrong,Pokemon Matser,Hall of Fame per excellence,7 leagues 6 Elite4,from Likenstrong,Kalos,starter Greninja but that wasn’t my type was darkened-Greninja,first region Johto-won,second Hoenn-won,3rd Kalos Frontier-won,4th Kanto-won,5th  Kalos-won,6th Unova of all-won,7th Orange-absolutely won,8th Sinnoh-by luck couldn’t win...so by the time he faced me he was already a 7 league champion(all laugh) had the temporary Pokemon Master Expert tag(all laugh) and was already married(all laugh),wife from Kanto,Crimson City,herself a 2 time champion out of 6-Hoenn and Kalos,was 35 by then,went to Orange before this for honeymoon(all laugh) and finished by around 37 only losing to Lance in Elite4,was a real myth when he faced me cause he had innumerable psudeo-legend dragons(all laugh) and was absolutely brilliant with them and now way better...right Brock surely you were told not to trash talk him(all laugh)”
Brock(laugh) : “right,so then Dawn was 18 and all too ladied up for Ash(all laugh)...then we before the finals were ready and Ash was of course was being devoured up by his girlfriend-flower(all laugh) as usual and then in that match i just gave up saying no matter what this is impossible against Nigel of all people cause only Nigel could do that(all laugh) and so were the others saying but Ash looked as calm and confident but that day looked just too self established as if he knew he still would defeat Nigel no matter what he does or what his name and skills are..well that was the begining of Tyranitar(all laugh)..that Tyranitar would’ve in a second pierced Ultranercozma apart(all laugh)..and that Solgaleo(all laugh)..would’ve sent 5 Zapdoes flying off to all hells(all laugh)..what was the girlfrien-flower doing Daisy(all laugh)?”
Daisy(laugh) : “the screen wasn’t moist(all laugh)...but i was(all laugh)..and throughout namecalling Nigel and especially his wife(all burst into laughter)..then 1 goes down and all that,5th comes in Greninja and Mist was all over the poor boy saying what to do to BEAT water types(all laugh)..then Gernija goes down now screen is moist first(all laugh) then after Gengar went down i could barely see anything(all laugh)...and she was sitting on my head(all laugh)...”
Brock(laugh) : “yeah and when Yveltal of all(all laugh)..in pursuit of happiness(all laugh) so Yveltal went down in 7th i just thought that’s it cause Krookodile was so huge throughout and you know what a Yveltal is a psudeo-legend and so much power and all and goes down to the same pokemon who has beaten Uxie(all laugh),Volcanion(all laugh)-what’s volcanic water Mr Slate(all laugh),Sableye(all laugh)..hope he behaves(all laugh),Krookodile(all laugh)-what was the constituents of what(all laugh),Musharna(all laugh)-did you talk(all laugh),Solgaleo of all pokemons(all laugh),whoose after me now for unhappiness(all laugh),Rotom(all laugh)-change the form(all laugh),TYRAniTAR(all laugh) then goes i felt like crying(all laugh),well he makes Ninetails cry now(all laugh),water or fire(all laugh) and still beat of all Crawdaunt(all laugh) no distributed words(all laugh)..well that’s impossible now though(all laugh)..cause he doesn’t eat substandard food like 100 Ghostradarkarrigussonors(all laugh)..but that was the last day he was serious right Ash(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “absolutely i chided all and there reactions were they were sorry that they were complacant i just told them look play and fun is sure but when you know you’re battling atleast try to battle and just not think that next moment it’ll be over and we’ll be back..this was infact the beginning stages(all laugh)..Crawdaunt revolted really(all laugh)...said if i only allowed him to then he could’ve pokenamecalled(all laugh) tore apart that Ultranercozma(all laugh)...which now possible but i realized he’s saying i don’t want to battle like this,Feraligator was first to say this of course(all laugh) and i knew that brat was poking this brat(all laugh)...so let him go in team rocket only joined totally different both then,still battled though but that final day(all laugh)...that will atleast the greatest boss would ever want to talk about that’s professional pinacle in all lives for me(all smile)..but Crawdaunted version of legend toppling was amusing(all laugh)..you know his nastiness here will not be applicable there so now the real Crawdaunt comes out,says,’um..you want to attack i see but you see i ever wondered what if what attack you’re thinking to use next moment doesn’t want to come out(all laugh) but the exact opposite does(all burst into laughter)..the legend is totally stunned with this(all laugh) cause he realizes that Crawdaunt has hit the knail on it’s head to begin with saying you really don’t want to attack at all so just are doing whatever comes into your mind..i mean all the attacks that exists if taken into consideration then we must understand which attack is precisely the opposite to which and there categories to mixing all up and considering all only can we be sure whether the exact opposite is truely so or is not opposite at all(all burst into laughter)...then shows the legend a hallucination of many legends a bit different looking then asks what if all are doing the exact opposite that they themselves are thinking(all burst into laughter)...then shows again with similar looking legends and then saying how is this physical feature getting different due to different aspects of the body(all burst into laughter)...this goes on and the legend says where the hell are you from(all laugh)...Crawdaunt says,’it’s just the way to see a plan(all burst into laughter)...this is Feraligator who used the Crawdaunt trick of combining all attacks with others to give a minute picture that no attack can be exactly pointed out(all burst into laughter) thus there’s no pure attack at all and thus all type differences can’t really be comprehended so why this will agitate the legend who doesn’t attack himself if his beau mouth him(all burst into laughter) so are we even here(all laugh),thus may we dance(all burst into laughter)...now Crawdaunt goes on with the combinations of plans which are the exact opposite then showing the fallacies in them(all burst into laughter) saying he isn’t satisfied to only see a pokemon but all the mental plans that he is thinking of so that the opposing plans are sorted out(all burst into laughter) so the mental peace is achieved(all burst into laughter) cause all is because of mental agitation ain’t it(all laugh)...legend realized that this brat has surpassed the word lunacy ages ago(all laugh) then just actually joined him in the play(all laugh) but couldn’t continue fainted but then woke up by now Crawdaunt was not there got Noivern(all burst into laughter)...,’i see my friend told you about plans,but what is a plan exactly(all laugh) what is this life at all(all burst into laughter)..see at your age the issues that you have(all laugh uncontrollably)..’..Nivy is Nivy you know(all laugh)..this just before that final bang and Palkia was doing his logical circle(all laugh) and Goodra was counting every bit of everything imaginable as different(all laugh)..Xormnuh tried to pull the same antics on him,says,’i see your counting me but i’m counting you too so doesn’t that mean we are actually counting the same thing cause we’re both counting the counting(all burst into laughter)’..and you realize on the verge of sure death this is going on..finally after reaching here all were all over me and was telling these,Goodra scoffed at them saying none of you counted the time upto now since we met each other so many times,precisely(all burst into laughter)...then all jumped on him and all..but Charizard was most fatally injured and send all to their dates there(all laugh)..goes to the pokemon centre 10 days no response,11 th day wakes up,first thing to a pokemon which was to begin with a Zygarde(all burst into laughter),’um..have you ever thought of approaching your beau for another date(all burst into laughter) or if you have a crush(all uncontrollably laugh) then how to approach,at what minute kind of feeling which approach is most suitable but what are the situations that may arise for which how to prepare(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) see i’ve had a long thought on this when i was sleeping(fits of laughter)...Zygarde fled the scene immediately(all laugh)..but mine of course(all laugh)..legend comes says so many ideas in your mind now later not then this idea of no ideas(all laugh) are you ever alone at peace(all laugh) and with others are they happy if you’re not at peace if they don’t disturb you like you beau(all burst into laughter) legend of Stitartomosdragum immediately fled the scene of alone of crowd(all laugh)..what a brat that is(all laugh)..and Brock handles her(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “no this brat has fed me to Dialga and Zygarde of all brats and one day i was in silence(all laugh) that brat Zygarde zaps in suddenly and says still aren’t you not alone(all burst into laughter)..i dozed the brat off(all laugh)..really man these aren’t dragons by any means(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “that idea of dragon isn’t a dragon Mr Oak Mr Oak what is a pokemon(all laugh)..anyway,after all those pokecentre and hospital antics we all return and all..in that 16 hours jumping all things sorted out but 16 hours(all laugh) and Mime was there to protect us so i had 107 and was in i started at 02:00 of course(all laugh) and ended at 18:00(all laugh) then this this was the first but for settlement each day 7 continuous same routine first day i came out and Mist jumped me(all laugh) then she had to be there i said please you will have trouble but that means i don’t like her(all laugh) so my sweet Mist flower had to be in there and all realized her as well cause i had to babysit her there(all laugh) came out almost insane after 5 minutes only(all laugh) i said please Mist you require time take rest all will be here i’m fine then she budged but later after she was in there for 2 hours next 7 days bed ridden(all laugh) but now it’s hardly a trouble for her to be 3/4 hours but that 3/4 is forced upon her in 1 hour by my brats(all laugh) but they know her extremely well now cause her brats are spoiled too(all laugh) so too much bonhomie(all laugh)..but after return i was told everything by everyone then all including even Mime was on Chu of all(all laugh)..cause his fun surely can’t match all of theirs cause they were doing so much(all laugh)..and Mime said she was alone here and the Magmorter group was so foolish(all burst into laughter),Gary’s Magmorter backstabbed his types(all laugh) as did Golem(all laugh)..as usual(all laugh)..Magmortgolem(all laugh)..now they can tame any legend too i guess(all laugh)..anyway,then all pester Chu and Chu gets angry and says no you only fooled around but didn’t have to be serious for a long time(All laugh) but i threatened this and that brat(all laugh),which is greeted by Bulbasaur as a custom(all laugh),who was too jovial,’i see but did they also properly plan by the meaning of those to make sure they are reflecting weakness and are afraid actually of their beaus cause on the first date they couldn’t know each other well(all burst into laughter)...i was thinking thank God this brat wasn’t there,cause he knows all tricks and will mix them up(all laugh)...Bulbasaur greeted the first batch saying,’i see too mixed up,AH BEAUTY,BEAUTY(all laugh)’..but Heracross as usual(all laugh)..now absolutely unbeatable cause she now knows legendary beaus(all laugh)..asked the legend if her beau sweet talks her ENOUGH or not(all laugh)..what a bunch,Nivy learns that Steelix is old(all burst into laughter)..Brock that bit after my Ultranercozma(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “ um...but isn’t it true that dark is psychic but also dragon is water(all laugh)...but what if i try to be Charizards,hey Snorlax can i be able to swim then(all laugh)...but you can’t attack to swim(all laugh) or like you can’t use watergun but why don’t you body slam me(all laugh) cause Charizard can(all laugh)..but Steelix(all laugh)..poor boy was here for just 4 days for recovery and this was the last(all laugh)..if all previous mental asylum wasn’t enough with Tyranitar,Dialga(all laugh) and Solgaleo(all laugh),comes in Noivern(All laugh) on his second day that brat Solgaleo poked him(all laugh)..’i see steel,what is the life of this steel(all laugh)..as your old what are the issues you faced with steel from your birth(all laugh)’..pestered him whole day..Foster said too disciplined for next week(all burst into laughter)..real brats those are(all laugh)...but yeah Ultranercozma was never used before but then goes Pikachu who by then physhic immune atleast upto non legendary level(all laugh) with his newfound powers and all...then the miracle happens,Ultranercozma then in comes Heatran(all laugh),down,then in comes Groudon(all laugh)..goes down,3 psudeo legends down by a Pikachu was just impossible to digest and that with 2 fire types named Heatran and Groudon(all laugh) all with electricus-psycus-chairs of all attacks(all laugh) for 10 minutes continuing(all laugh) just to show Chu is ever Psychic immune and the self heal has become impossibly good but still was just below thunder-chair the highest but each continuing for like 5 minutes(all laugh)...but i was still thinking that how is this possible even(all laugh) then comes in Guzzlord(all laugh),in all honesty loses(all laugh) ethically(all burst into laughter)...Gerjnija is almost fried next,now comes in Zygarde of all dragons(all laugh) alone(all laugh)...now he too is off..then i could see that Nigel was a bit stunned too cause Zygarde took 12 minutes elcetric-chair(all laugh) and Ash was the same as when he sent Chu in and Chu looks very fresh so then 7th was Gulark of all ghosts(all laugh)...and Nigel was using most ground types cause he wanted to get Chu off and realized after Ultranercozma himself that flying types of any kind are of no use against Chu and finally his Greninja too failed and Gulark was steel/ground/ghost/fly(all laugh)...then Gulark too goes was also off,now i got very excited about it cause Chu was now a bit tired but could go on and Dawn never saw half those pokemons(all laugh) was all over Ash..and then comes in Gengar(all laugh)...still goes down too flustered after being too playfull(all laugh)..and Chu even after beating her licked her(all laugh)...so Nigel too was laughing by then and Ash reciprocated with a thumbs up that moment itself was huge wasn’t it screen cleaners(all laugh)”
Daisy(laugh) : “ sadly too moisty to clear(all laugh)...i was told to bow down to Ash immediately(all laugh) and so on...oh and also that her name is screamingly Mist Ketchum never Misty Ketchum(all laugh and .)..”
Brock(laugh) : “then i’m really anxious and the whole world was who was,Dawn was making me her flag almost(all laugh) and then of all it had to be a Tyranitar(all laugh),psudeo-legend dark-rock(all laugh) and did trouble Chu but that self heal and prolonging was just impossible to believe and did cajole Tyranitar to run out of patience which is(all laugh) and two back to back such events really made Chu absolutely knackered...but after this comes the climax so the reaction to this one...”
Daisy(laugh) : “absolutely,that was pokemon master for you..and Mist was all over seeing a another psudeo-legend to begin with cause that means Nigel is from Team Rocket(all burst into laughter)..then too rock a type advantage which meant Nigel’s wife eavesdropped Ash(all laugh)..and was the actual boss of Team Rocket(all laugh)..but then still goes down(all laugh) Chu gives a 13 minute electric-chair(all laugh) and Mist was moisting the whole screen now for ages(all laugh)...but we all really kinds saw Chu’s condition and he was totally brunt out had may be one more self heal left and that’s it atmost 2 attacks and all and except Mist whole world was pin drop silence(all laugh)..but then(all laugh)...”
Brock(laugh) : “yeah then now the whole world was at absolute pin drop silence and in comes Thurdurus(all laugh)...one of the most strongest electric types and again a psudeo-legend with the agility and pace to match with as well a flying type and a ferocious mythical pokemon(all laugh)...now we just couldn’t move whole world was silent whoever was watching and that sight of Nigel really was of a pokemon master with once ever talent and name a real legend that we were seeing who wanted to get all the 8-0 in his favour and then jump onto hall of fame status may be at 7-0 as well,giant screen shows his wife Ethena(all laugh)...she knew her husband and the bunch and was confident and then all were saying that Chu has sinked 9 pokemons alone 6 psudeo-legends(all laugh) that’s more than victory and all...i was just glued into the seat as was Dawn we just couldn’t move and i almost didn’t feel my body as well was all out cold really...now how was the reaction?”
Daisy(laugh) : “well poor Ethena was spared(all laugh)..Mist also was stunned none of us could move cause now an electric it’s just a matter of who has more left in the tank and we were really silent but then they show Ash,same features absolutely no emotions but yeah Nigel was looking like a Pokemon Master absolute once ever really that’s for sure and we were just glued to the seat...”
Brock(smile) : “yeah,Ash was same but Chu was so out of it was hard stuff really...and then Nigel first says thunder-chair(all laugh)...and Thundurus delivers his absolute best to Chu who had faced 9 before of such might...”
Daisy(smile) : “we were flustered really with that thunder-chair again cause we knew about it but those levels were something else and commentators even don’t know well what level that was but one said thunder-chair has many types its called Voltrain-thunder-chair which was the highest seen in last 200 years or so(all laugh) and reaches 2 levels above Katy’s absolute best with her Chu in her 4th last match of her career at 65(all laugh) and Laura of all legends never reached that(all laugh) but just one level below(all laugh) and all this was said while the referee was confused whether Chu is ok or not cause he was trembling but not giving up and Thundurus was self healed to getting ready to deliver the next....Mist was crying almost but then screamed like you’ve beaten Thundurus with same Chu for your mere first league beat that namecall(all laugh)..that was Orange rematch(all laugh)...and Nigel looked like he can win at no matter what”
Brock(smile) : “well i only saw the Orange version of Thundurus vs Chu in TV but i saw so many other Thundurus vs Chu later(all laugh) and thunder-chairs as well(all laugh) but despite so many electrics and even Thundurus’ against Chu,i was only remembering his 3rd gym match at Viridian match 12 years back and how Chu refused to evolve and then topple Raichu and he with similar types ever the smartest will win and nothing else can happen and in that 3rd badge that was that,Raichu’s agility was far less which was targetted upon and then Ash and Chu did win and after all we must understand it was Brawn(all laugh) so just that laugh when his bunch loses it(all laugh)..man that brat pestered me for years at Viridian(all laugh)..but this was a different stuff against Thundurus and i could see Chu like that i was just as usual like Dawn spellbound...and yes Nigel was really looking like he has it in his pocket and to me felt like a dream that was too real to break but started the master brat(all laugh) that was the moment Ash wasn’t it(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “yeah,i guess(all laugh) i saw Nigel like that and you know a true legend but i was in 6th league final and 3 time champ not new but he was 7 time champ in 8th region and when i saw that disposition i knew it’ll be max another Melody(all laugh) cause Thundurus wasn’t going to stand for more than 5 seconds(all laugh) and the trouble was that by then i had already decided to go to Unova and knew my bunch was naive that day for some strange reason after whole finals so extremely good so i just realized Unova will see some fireworks for sure with incoming dragons(all laugh) no matter my position would’ve been there to get the 4th league had i not won but the things happened there i never expected(all laugh) TYRAniTAR(all laugh)..that was scary really MENTALLY(all laugh)..no really man my brats fondled my nerves so much for 5 long years(all laugh) till second year at Kalos came around(all laugh) anyway,then also knew the 5th league as well if i tried and you know me would’ve went to Kalos for sure atleast(all laugh) but Unova would’ve been there immediately Kalos way later cause had so much time but had Chu lost that day it would’ve been a mayhem really(all laugh) and they had to reconsider cause at Unova each would’ve got 3 months pokecentre(all laugh) cause Chu would’ve jumped on me once his slumber broke and had Crawdaunt there with Tyranitar and Yveltal(all laugh) and Madgaleo was there as well(all laugh) but the thing is why i still say none could’ve beaten me there none sane that is not my current version or even the Unovan version that my bunch already was a week later from that day(all laugh) it’s all cause i knew my bunch and the viseversa so well that that bond had become unique and that itself will scare everyone off no matter who cause it was phenomenal stuff really and Chu later said wasn’t budging so easily only slept after the brat was there first(all laugh) so would’ve won anyway hence i never felt any anxiety any moment anywhere there felt as good as i did in Orange,Hoenn and Frontier and i knew i won cause Nigel of all people couldn’t get the feelings at that stage what i was getting so i was in plain language better than him  no matter what results said and will have my own unique path which is why even he started his career so in a way i was the winner to me and even more that feeling of satisfaction that this 2 years just this was possible next day go again and so i was the same as i was in Orange,Hoenn and Frontier and would’ve no matter the result but would’ve had to be at Unova next month(all laugh) and then i was thus ever similarly confident but Chu was too knackred and we both knew that we’ve saved the best that none has ever seen in ages(all laugh) so i knew yeah atleast Thundurus will have similar power or more but his nature of angry man isn’t going to help him at all(all laugh) and then Nigel and Thundurus looked so confident i knew they’ve lost it there itself cause neither me nor Chu wanted to battle like that since our 3rd badge itself(all laugh) cause Brawn i ever tell him you opened the gate really cause there i realized that mind games are all and that only can be done if you’re a pokemon yourself and let your bunch be you which none does(all laugh) and Brawn said AH! Kid i used to be so good when i first started then got a Rotom and was WOKEN(all laugh) i said yeah Rotoms will wake anyone for sure(all laugh) so then against Nigel too i started my Rotomic games(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “yeah,being a brat for sure(all laugh) then the ever non emotional Ash after 12 years takes his cap off first time throws it away(all laugh) and shakes his head while laughing to himself(all laugh)..i thought is he giving up(all laugh) whole world thought so but Nigel looked very suspicious(all laugh) cause he realized that was directed to him and his whole career(all laugh) so he was a bit stunned then was smiling and gave Ash a thums up to which Ash reciprocated and actually then with folded hands there itself pointed to Chu and saluted Nigel saying sorry for the bit of emotion(all laugh) and Nigel was happy again did the thumbs up exactly what is called the result of dishonestly honest hallucinations(all laugh) Ash was sorry for sure he ever said to all of us and Nigel should’nt have done it but still used it as a hallucination(all laugh) and the reverse version of what his bunch did against an opponent as well to confuse more(all laugh) and then the match was on but none of us could move or talk really but how was the screen(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “well that made me understand that this is the biggest infatuated egotistical brat(all laugh) and Mist was too stunned couldn’t do anything at all(all laugh)..but now Ash will do the before-the-climax stuff”
Ash(smile) : “well Nigel asked me last time how i got rid of Raftosmoric(all laugh),’Nigel,that’s Feraligated ever(all laugh)’...he faced me during Elite4 in Kalos and Feraligator and Crawdaunt both were there(all laugh)..we did a 2 on 2 with waters and you know Nigel’s bunch of Crawdaunt(all laugh) and Gyarados(all laugh and .) turned on him immedietely(all laugh)..and Nigel of all legends said that was normal this is heinous(all laugh)..his Crawdaunt was told by mine that mine was a bit more distributedly depressed(all burst into laughter)..and shown how Nigel’s was more happy(all laugh)..cause Gyarados was told as the plan(all laugh) that he was held back by Crawdaunt cause Crawdaunt can’t swim quickly(all burst into laughter)..created a rift(all laugh)..and was shown how exchanging pokeballs is the way to solve this and thus get Nigel in one(all laugh) cause he intentionally did this pairing(all burst into laughter)..both looked at Nigel with tears(all burst into laughter)..then started infighting(all laugh)..then as Nigel comes in my water duo danced with him and detroyed his dress(all laugh)..Nigel said starter only for fun(all laugh)..anyway then Chu was totally knackered appeasing Gengar of all(all laugh) then came Solgaleo and he was telling me and as i said before we were rather planning and wasn’t a one way discussion and just him signalling how much he can but he was saying what he thinks he would and i told him keep patience Tyranitar also has psudeo-legend steel advantage Nigel will fumble if you make Tyranitar overconfident and Nigel’s strategy was because i myself have a Tyranitar for 7 years then Chu will be himself overconfident and would want to finish quickly and so patience(all laugh) but Chu using that same familiarity made Tyranitar overconfident which in that condition was so difficult(all laugh) and you know Gyarados or Tyranitar may get overconfident but never sane(all laugh) so still will want to kill you even after dead themselves(all laugh) and Nigel’s trock of not using a psychic but a dark continouously was perfect cause psychis major Heatran and then dark major Groudon was more than enough for him to understand the psychic planes aren’t going to make Chu confused cause of their kinda dreamy nature with gradually developing plight whereas the dark planes though shorter spanned still will test Chu more and more with more consistent ferocity and that’s all cause in that situation Chu won’t get overconfident no matter what the psychics cajole him into the darks won’t and thus the self heal has to budge and still for cajoling Gengar was there(all laugh) but with Tyranitar each time the respone was weaker and longer to give the illusion he is trying his best to finish but can’t(all laugh) and was slowly dying(all laugh) no really that Nigel feared very fatal injuries and got confident so told Tyranitar to go easy and finish now(all laugh) and then Tyranitar himself got fried(all laugh) but then Thundurus(all laugh) and unlike the rest neither Nigel nor Thundurus would get overconfident or go easy(all laugh) but then Chu then himself was wanting thunder-chair,i said no focus on self heal and atleast don’t just give up like your other mates have today cause now we know for pursuit of happiness(all laugh) and then gave up thus by not being serious enough(all laugh) atleast while they know they are battling(all laugh) and not playing and play will ever be but here be serious and Chu agreed finally reluctantly but Thundurus was a different stuff,he was wanting Chu to go the distance so played into our hands and still perfectly right strategy from Nigel keeping Thundurus till end despite seeing all and yeah,i knew Thundurus was not budging unless he won that day,Chu scoffed at me saying he has only one and going to self destruct and straight to rest(all laugh)...i said yeah but play well with your own type atleast cause you don’t like Luxray which hurt his pride by both means(all laugh) cause the day before Luxaray was there(all laugh) and he pestered Chu for hours and Chu was unhappy and Luxaray finally had to fondle Chu to death to calm him down and take flamethrowers from Charizard(all laugh)...it was done exactly to tell Chu that no matter you just found new powers you must not misbehave(all laugh)...so then he takes it i knew he was self healing and his connection to me became very faint cause he was so weak and i just told him 1 more and we’ll be playing with Thundurus if his mood is right(all laugh) and others and that made Chu happy and then he just unplugged...”
Brock(laugh) : “not eloquently atleast(all laugh)...so then Thundurus goes with another voltrain but way above that comes darkray-voltsol-thunder-chair,only once reached by the great Graham Vileta and that’s 200 years back(all laugh) with his starter Pikachu on his very last match(all laugh) and that was 5 levels above Katy’s Voltboom and that Chu did exactly...and for way way longer by 4 minutes(all laugh) than Graham’s Chu did but it wasn’t necessary for her then to stay more but it was 200 years back(all laugh)...and then it’s best described by motior managers(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “it was a pool that day(all laugh)...Chu goes with that thunder-chair,commentators hardly knows what that is nothing is seen except the Voltrain is stacked with it’s producer by Voltsol and then voltsol stays long eough to mitigate voltrain and then finally in the end Thundurus was devoured completely by the voltsol with that picture of literal chair turning Thundurus to become dark and the plight of Thundurus of all pokemons shaking so so much like a leaf in the eye of a tornedo and Nigel looked totally astonished and devastated to see his Thundurus’s plight out of blue after that attack..and that literal darkray was darkening with the chair as that yellow thunder was glittering and blinking and the dark eack moment was intensifying and became like yellow-clack stripes which was beautiful but more so was death(all laugh) and was there for 13 long minutes(all laugh) and so was Thundurus(all laugh) then as Nigel was visibly concerned about Chu(all laugh) Ash was shown totally unemotional as if Chu has 5 more left(all laugh) then comes that awesome line from commentary(all laugh)..ashes to ashes,better to best(all laugh),10 doesn’t Chu enough,send us the next(all laugh and .,Ash shakes his head laughing)...then our Mist flower hearing that drowned in her own tears(all laugh) jumped 10 feet high from sofa(all laugh) and destroyed the monitor totally by submerging with it(all laugh)...and then all finishes and still Thundurus is just about standing on the ground and still trying to fly(all laugh) with a face extremely determined but astonishingly Chu is stading with the help of his tail once more somehow BUT nonchalantly smiling(all laugh) with no determination what-so-ever(all laugh)..that’s true pokemind games you know that your determination won’t surpass eventual(all laugh) and thus Chu still sparks wile smiling(all laugh)..and Nigel looked still confident(all laugh)..but then comes the unemotional master(all laugh) just thumbs up to Nigel(all laugh)..now Nigel had laughed and admitted defeat by pointing to to and giving thumbs up(all laugh) cause another 10 will be too much for one match(all laugh) and Thundurus then was befooled(all laugh) as he just understood that the opposition was total battle starved lunatics(all laugh) who first let it become an impossible comeback to enjoy the food even more(all laugh) and now were preying upon him most cause no more were left and so now he’s more angry cause he still is straving for more with each passing opponent(all laugh) the art of battle hunger(all laugh) so going down is better(all laugh) so fainted(all laugh)..but still as i heard that was brat counting to Tyranitar(all laugh)..then those 10 seconds then the referee says 10 more(all laugh)...Mist was swearing his head off(all laugh) saying his namecalled wife bribed by namecalled Ethena(all laugh) told him to do exactly this that very morning(all laugh)...then that takes 23 finally declares that Ash is the winner and Chu just about 3 seconds after the announcement falls down and then Ash was shown no emotion just smiling with another thumbs up(all laugh) to which Nigel did the same but as i just can’t believe myself what i saw and then just after Ash is shown again i hear a shrill beside me(all laugh) and she just screams ‘Ash’ and straight to the screen(all laugh)..then Mist deluged the screen(all laugh) and again the phone(all laugh)..was trying her hand at me as well(all laugh)..and then from Viol we came to know and all then next day that discourse(all laugh)..Mist was reminding us on top of her voice that she is for 11 years a Ketchum too(all laugh)...then Nigel is sweared to hell for making is so hard for Ash(all laugh) and yeah there was Ethena(all laugh)....when she tried to congratulate Ash after battle,it was screechingly proved(all laugh) that her birth was cursed(all laugh) and now her utter demolition has brought everpresent peace and happiness(all laugh)...how was the whole night call Ash...”
Ash(laugh) : “Mistyvious as ususal(all laugh)...right(all laugh)..”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “the discourse once more(all agree)..”
Ash(laugh) : “eat battle starve repeat(all laugh)..well Chu was saying this and that is going to happen if Ultranercozma tries this and that and so on and i said just be cautious and 5 types i told him said be fast but prudent has to see you to do anything cause can’t get under your skin as you yourself are psychic immune,though weren’t completely then at all much much much lesser but was alright,then i said has faced 9 pokemons will be tired don’t let the brat see you long enough(all laugh) said Pika(all laugh) that means the brat’s time is up(all laugh)..next comes Heatran(all laugh) so i’m just telling my thought process..
psychic has to see you,ghost has to engage you,dragon has to belittle you(all laugh),steel has to bully you(all laugh) and dark has to unceasingly attack you so balance by being qickly indifferent(all laugh) said so sweet your games for your beau doesn’t appease me(all burst into laughter) and you know i could never anticipate any reply if i was sawearing another(all laugh) only counter if possible with same words changing meaning(all laugh) so i just told this and said as long as you can go on with one line don’t get irritated youself and that worksed luckily(all laugh) i said atleast unlike your bossom friends who let themselves down today we got 1 atleast says just beginning(all laugh) and those choised 9 brats now resting in pokeballs will jump him once the match is up only did this because they are preparing dating plans(all burst into laughter) all of them were extremely vulgar then(all burst into laughter) but that was so nice to hear cause it’s not like us it’s so easy for them and sweet for us to listen(all laugh) cause they cherish us so much(all laugh)...anyway then,fire has to keep patience with you(all laugh) rest same so simply irritate and have fun(all laugh)..this one befooled Nigel cause he just went for fire and steel psudeo-legend and just the previous showed that Chu is only interested in power games(all laugh) and the indifference means ghosts won’t work(all laugh) then comes Groudon same all power but Groudon will die than to get irrtated(all laugh) so i said frustrate him(all laugh) by saying you’re at 3 your master doesn’t trust you enough cause you long to much for your beau(all laugh) Groudon and the previous ones were also swearing(all laugh) and me and Nigel was enjoying it so much(all laugh) but the trouble for Nigel was that Groudon wasn’t using his own brain which Chu was and thus it got heavy for Groudon as you know the great battle buff David Duncun says(all laugh) that to tell the opponent to cherish me(all laugh) one has to understand that my brat has done that exact trick all alone on me every moment for 500 years(all laugh) cause she was frustrated at my hesitation of better friending(all laugh) then so Groudon gets frustrated and wants to finish quickly goes full bust and falls into the trap by not being cautious and was too predictable then comes in all honesty(all laugh) Guzzlord(all laugh) i said this brat will absolutely kill you(all laugh) Chu is angry says such choised brats won’t be back to the beaus without regrets(all burst into laughter) i said if you attack directly a type advangate his beau will have regrets for you(all laugh) so Chu is angry says you brat yourself are at bay(all laugh) i said startle him after feigning weakness as long as you can and as better as you can cause the brat will unceasingly attack you while showing you how good each time he is becoming and won’t get frustrated or irritated or bemused at all in this so just make him doubt his abilities then he will lose it(all laugh) that’s what happens and in comes Greninja(all laugh) thank God she was not a nationalist(all laugh) and also here you see no matter what Chu does nigel wants to push him to feign weakness and take attacks cause one psychic who will try to make you feel comfortable means Chu will get so extremely confident that the psychic will be in the next life battling(all laugh) so Greninja comes and Chu is of course too happy(all laugh) i say just that she isn’t giving up easily like other choised water brats of the name Crawdaunt(all laugh) well he said the same to me as did Chu(all laugh) so Greninja is just befriended(all laugh) cause i said water type will see you as a bully and won’t believe in you quickly so don’t show that ask for age related issues(all laugh) was asked how old your beau’s and your master’s parents were(all burst into laughter) and so on then(all laugh) comes in the great Zygarde(all laugh) Zygarde is psychic dark same so very hard opponent and thus i tell you Chu that you’ve lost the match(all laugh) Chu says you have(all burst into laughter) but i’ll play with him(all burst into laughter) i say exactly play with him as long as he doesn’t want to(all laugh) and do the exact opposite the next he will then have to show the dragoninc nature of might to threaten you and kill you then you tell him that all this is beacuse his tricks didn’t work(all laugh) and tell him he can’t take it if he loses in play i’m a sportspokemon(all laugh) does that and Zygarde is very angry in the end(all laugh) and makes the mistake of showing how good his dragoninc nature is than the rest which Nigel told him to do(all laugh) but we continued and because Chu himself was doing that he constantly repeated that how can dragon nature be good if the others associeted weren’t then you’re weak at the end of the day on last resort are you sure of yourself(all laugh) and that his own dragon friends thought the same yet their other tricks were better(all laugh) and so on this raining assult was out of Nigel’s reach to control and then Zygarde had to use his own brain where none can beat my bunch cause they exactly then would revert back to the memories of master and that is master loves we do too(all laugh) then protection comes and thus anger and then you’re in more of a trap(all laugh) and thus cause my bunch cherishes me(all laugh) so they get though now Nigel was really shocked(all laugh) cause he later said Zygarde was very good in mind games but couldn’t control himself and Nigel was forced to cut the link cause he couldn’t understand how could a little pokemon without psychics like Chu do that(all laugh) and none of them told Nigel that i say saying those they said Chu himself says almost all of these(all laugh) cause others except legends won’t read my communication signals but i can of theirs(all laugh) cause my bunch is doing the exact opposite that i’m telling them to(all laugh) then i was still telling Chu the early bits but like Goodra i was just enjoying the scene and talking with Xormnuh(all laugh) Goodra looked after himself i don’t bother(all laugh) and except that i don’t believe in my way befriending legends are possible cause they want that freedom between me and Goodra ELOQUENTLY(all laugh) no if Lugia wants to get into pokeballs that brat will be really giving crypts(all laugh) even to me(all laugh) anyway then come in and why Nigel is a legend with his bunch is then comes Gulark(all laugh) now Chu was more than fresh still and i realized the final resort is the ghostly games next two round(all laugh) then possibly another psudeo legend dark of type advantage but i wasn’t sure that Chu can go more than 9(all laugh) the 10th was fun cause Chu was in no condition to play mind games just a few words i said to rile him up and assure him of play and that was it(all laugh) the last bit of threatening Thundurus was all his own just faintly told me i’m ok that brat isn’t returning either(all laugh) but i may sleep earlier(all laugh) and they don’t understand the 10 counts(all laugh) so i told Chu before sleeping tell that brat his beau should think twice cause you threatened him(all laugh) and now come my bunch’s intelligence despite me(all laugh) if he told that Thundurus would’ve won so he showed that only(all laugh and .) and that’s cause Chu knew he is finished and Thundurus may still have something left so to threaten he should tell by showing(all laugh) that he’s less sleepy(all laugh and .) exactly what he did to the Telplocus’ not one word when i asked told me such idiotically chosen brats don’t deserve words(all laugh and .) just the disposition was enough and yeah that has been perfected by the once only movie director(all laugh) so anyway in comes Gulark and is ground/steel/ghost/fly(all laugh) means groudn and steel bullying will go by flying disadvantage and then the ghost will show(all laugh) so told Chu he must play with you no matter what he does make sure he’s comfortable(all laugh) and befriend him by feigning weakness then play contradict each moment your actions and words till you know he only wishes to play then attack the best you can and make sure he doesn’t return sfter the first(all laugh) and the rest Chu did himself thus again Nigel and Gulark was at bay(all laugh) said so storng yet so soft(all laugh) and so on then the ghosts comes yeah just this my sweetie(all laugh) so Gulark was given his own medicine and was off(all laugh) but Chu was now tired finally could go atmost 2 still(all laugh) depending on opponents and thus Nigel chose Gengar(all laugh) to get that even more Gengar being Gengar disobeyed Nigel(all laugh) and was off(all laugh) and mine eaxactly here beats all cause he doesn’t obey when in the ball(all laugh) so legend was told the same line Mr Oak says,what is this Gengar if full of care/i can’t fool around and you won’t fare(all laugh) that was enough one line may be 1000 times(all laugh) legend scoffed his master are you happy(all laugh) and then psyched off,Sableye said,’what is this Sableye if battle has to be cared/i can’t tickle you,then you’ll get scared/what is this life that you have/that i can’t be assured you’re happy and not sad(all laugh) that was honesty in ethical negotiations(all laugh) the first 2 was Sableye(all laugh) so legend tested further when he was told to teach his beau how to properly tickle(all laugh) legend was angry but eventually realized that he must be exactly opposite shouldn’t he(all burst into laughter) and that was before Sableye was questioned so if Lugia is spoiled(all laugh) he will ask um..yeah right are you unhappy that you’re beau thinks her wings aren’t soft enough(all burst into laughter) extreme vulgarity(all laugh) but you can realize that no humans will want this brat to be in opposition(all laugh) and if Ghostradarkarrigussonor then it will be said how much of your future are you part of(all burst into laughter) that will be it(all laugh) cause it’s responsibility commitment and joviality triple sword(all laugh) and for them commitment means choosing and assurence(all laugh) so totally devastaed will the opponent be so Gengar goes but Chu was tired and Nigel’s plan did work in a way though he expected Gengar to finish it(all laugh) and then comes in TYRAniTAR(all laugh) well minewas battle starved already then(all laugh) now i told Chu this brat is familier to you(all laugh) doesn’t the brat that’s inside the ball with me now having fun(all laugh) then Chu said yeah the brat will be shown the door(all laugh) i said keep patience and let him attack till you have to retort but be very alert cause if this brat is on top of you no chance(all laugh) he did that cause he has done it 1000 times(all laugh) and thus the familiarity worked against Nigel and that Nigel became confident that this is it and i told Chu each time ask me to recall you but know that i wont(all laugh) this Chu liked very much the real deceiving trick(all laugh) which again only my bunch could do but now doesn’t need to cause they’re weak(all laugh) so they cherish me so much(all laugh) so Nigel was scared of Chu and Tyranitar was leased to her utter dismay(all laugh) and got off so infact that made sure that Nigel goes for all out power now as the last i thought of finally a psychic cause chu was tired and psychic did come but was Thundurus(all laugh)..and yes the deceiving trick that we used to do in Sinnoh in last parts then they themselves did(all laugh) that was that i told them of my motives but if the opponent is told the same at the same time it has to mean that the challenger and his pokemon are honest to themselves first and then second doesn’t want to kill anyone and third is the master must understand what deceive means to that exact pokemon in which way only then that command would work  and fourth is the pokemon himself must know himself in and out and his masters motives then will understand and interpret in his own language and ways and then must use his own brain to exceute that cause if they keep telling me what the opponents reaction is it won’t work cause his master will know it and lastly and most importantly each of the opponents thought process must be known beforehand for my Chu to himself do that trick and exactly where familiarity with Tyranitar worked other cases wouldn’t have(all laugh) BUT again only because you had no other option against Tyranitar(all laugh) all dark types are either cocky or something(all laugh) Tyranitar is battle kill eat the brat repeat(all laugh) and you know the height(all laugh) Garchomp is same but Garchomp is freedom loving more and has that dragonic nature of might(all laugh) just the reflection(all laugh) so it could’ve been possible to still break his trust saying you can’t use your brain cause you’re infatuated with your master(all laugh) as soon as Nigel retorted the word was i’m going to rest and thus to be free/you’ll go back to the ball of another for another emotional spree(all laugh and .) that was enough for Garchomp as well as Nigel to admit defeat cause that’s true(all laugh) and exactly what Banette did(all laugh) at present you think of the past or the future to come by/so you’re attacking me for reasons that aren’t my(all laugh and .) that was it(all laugh) so then goes Tyranitar and finally Thudurus i said he wants to go the distance so just kill him(all laugh) but i said the opposite way saying all cause you’re like the 9 and so on to rile him up(all laugh) then finally told him one last attack to show the 9 that they were thinking of their beaus despite themselves(all laugh) and thus is shown the art of proper playing with respect to the defeated(all laugh) in all honesty of ethical honesty(all laugh) so Thundurs goes and the discourse was i guess took 5 seconds to this(all laugh) but i guess i said those things like psychic has to see you,ghost has to engage you,advantage will bully you,disadvantage will loath you(all laugh),dark will be unceasing to you,dragon will belittle you,same type will race long with you(all laugh) so quickly indiffernet,compete to play even more(all laugh),bullies must be shown weakness,bullied must be shown patience(all laugh),unceasing brats must be made overconfident or frustrated(all laugh),startle dragons to get them insecured(all laugh) and if race then shorten it as much as possible(all laugh) and then it worked Chu i knew was threatening only and then that count(all laugh)...Brock about that a bit later but i in the very beginning first saw Nigel like that too confident i did my antics to tell them that’s kindergarten mastery i’ve passed that at 16(all laugh) and this was the only time i was disrespectful like that and you know i myself ever faced so many antics(all laugh) and thus Nigel was stunt cause i played the non emotional stuff till exactly when he became confindent most(all laugh) so he understood might be this 9 down to 9 down was totally planned by me(all laugh) to show exactly that all this regional league is kindergarten to me and my bunch now well to be honest that was Unova advanced(all laugh) and no at that time i did feel egotistical and i ever as have said it was a moment of madness and then and there did apologize as i got back to senses(all laugh) but that was all because i was expecting way better things from Nigel of all people not that phonix stuff(all laugh) he could’ve been what i now would’ve done even a week after that final itself that may be you’re confident as a set up but is it you or the set up which validates whom(all laugh) that means the egotistical brat has to use the go to judge himself again cause the two are different thus if not his dishonestly honest hallucinations will be unmasked and he will be only honest thus hallucinations don’t work hence his Chu fails and that is the human pokemon link breaker(all laugh) the thoughts appearing as thoughts in your thoughts(all laugh) cause there’s no happiness if born is an idea who gives life to the idea or the viseversa(all laugh) really Sinnoh Ketchum is a mere kid to us now(all laugh) TYRAniTAR(all laugh)..anyway,so Nigel gave me the leeway really i apologized to him then by folding my hands and then many times after that and Nigel is such a generous person ever said no kindergarten for sure no doubt(all laugh) then whole world knows my training methods by questioning(all laugh) so many followed that and still does each time tamed bunch gets untamed(all laugh) that feeling(all laugh) and i ever tell them see it’s not about only me at all look who manages my bunch back at the den(all laugh) nowhere you will find a jackal like this human version(all laugh) on whom any trick will be practised without any limits(all laugh) and then Mr Oak Mr Oak what is a pokemon(all laugh) none will type specify himself to be a pokemon to begin with(all laugh) no really Gary is absolutely similar to me but our interestes are varied so he wants the meolcules of pokemons rather than the mind gross against subtle that is interlinked(all laugh) and then i say man after all i went to my first gym and saw a MAN(all laugh) and then just knew that it’s just so naive(all laugh) so i barely have had to think of anything else and still my Muk and Snorlax and Feraligator and Crawdaunt and else were indeed DESTINED to me(all laugh) destined cause they might’ve came when i was 75(all laugh) so lucky indeed(all laugh) and still i know the human Mantine as well(all laugh) and then Daisy and Lillie fondled my bunch to extreama really(all laugh) these own flesh and blood care is as much important to get the brats their wish that is to unleash to that maddening tune of self(all laugh) and then anyway the initial goes it infact only deepens the confidence in both Nigel and Thundurus and that’s exactly what we wanted cause by then we got rid of all possible human emotions so humans could’nt beat us only pokemons could but he was so attached to his master so no chance(all laugh) again your honestly dishonest hallucinations(all laugh) but in Unova i was Kommo-O(all laugh) that was something else but then the real game started when we got WOKEN(all laugh) the woken version will laugh at my Sinnoh final self so much cause i was thinking i was hallucinating thus i’ll fail cause i myself have to be that thus dishonest thus the trust breaks so the very basic of being a pokemon and the viseversa is broken so Ash Ketchum will abjectly lose(all laugh) cause the woken version is Gengar thus doesn’t think at all(all laugh) same in case of Unova as well but to a much much lower level anyway,then in the end saw Thundurus and Nigel were upto that boring ashes to phonix stuff once more doesn’t learn even after thunder-chair shock(all laugh) so i was laughing in my head that both Chu and me will get them left and right now(all laugh) and that’s eactly cause Nigel wanted to give Thundurus confidence and they aren’t Chu so only reciprocating and confidence doesnt fetch you victories in my book eventuality does(all laugh) cause that is luck(all laugh) so don’t bother about stuffs have fun being ethically honest(all laugh) and happy(all laugh) yeah that’s Yveltal anything you do is unhappy so don’t do then happy(all laugh) to us it’s being honest to them it’s just being NAIVE(all laugh) so Nigel is finally trapped and thus i thunbs up to him(all laugh) with smile saying best wishes(all laugh) then Nigel realized the eventual as he saw Chu and Thundurus told him the brat is unfathomable(all laugh) and just looked at me and all realized with Thundurus that once they win the trophy and go to the centre Chu will jump on him(all laugh) and no matter what all did none could get under the skin of anyone even since Orange and this was 6th 9 years later and then Chu was Chu(all laugh) before it was just i told them that it doesn’t matter all is the human brat doing not the pokebrat(all laugh) somehow they realized that and remained unfazed and each were directed at pokebrats(all laugh) and human brats too cause no matter what only a few line were repeated only one for each opposition i prepared before(all laugh) and that day in Sinnoh in case of Thundurus and Nigel that fear was enough for any legendary challenger to go cause they just saw that and none knew what Chu was doing and the final mind game of fearing the unknown cause your own pokemon is not fully known to you and yet you’re a true legend cause they love you and viseversa but in the opposition it’s so much known that you’re so confident to not bother about him at all(all laugh) and i was doing and so was Chu meant that word love was done for twin bros(all laugh) then now just me(all laugh) and that meant i was VICTORIOUS(all laugh and .) so that was it and Thundurus understood that we’re in next league already 1st round and waiting to prey upon him again(all laugh) so went down and i later told Nigel that may be Thundurus was scared cause i thought he had something left Chu didn’t(all laugh) Nigel laughed saying Chu had the deceit of honesty(all laugh) if Chu came first it would’ve been the reversed result and Stuart yeah even said the name(all laugh) that would’ve found a compatriot(all laugh) Stu was just irritated too much to waste 1.5 years(all laugh) and on that day was ultimate and his bunch caught that throughout(all laugh) tried to comeback but by then we got under his skin and now permanently there with jasu(all laugh)..and even Lance sanctioned the remodelled Frontier trophy(all laugh) tried to revoke then i said are you 7th and lonenly(all laugh) anyway Nigel then asked why the rest were suddenly so naive(all laugh) i said yeah a gym leader was there(all laugh) just the dishes(all laugh) the touch the peronality the talks the behaviour the way the bunch the philosophy the MAN(all laugh) it’s just so NAIVE(all laugh,Brock .ly laughs)...”
Brock(laugh) : “well Crawdauntogator managed to get even me not naive(all laugh) when they were Corpishnaw(all laugh)...well first the initial antics then the end then the count i realized this brat all along extremely cunning(all laugh) cause i knew him for 12 years and yet i didn’t know what he was upto there(all laugh) and i never have since the 2nd year in Kanto(all laugh) Misty always would know what her husband is upto(all laugh) but he likes her so she comes in no use at all during his matches(all laugh) and Ash though like everyone else he saw never knew what Misty was upto(all laugh) cause is mentioned in that greeting(all laugh) thus he ever only looked at Misty(all laugh) but this all till Hoenn group stages atmost then since round 32 there and then after that none knew what Ash was doing cause he himself had no clue of it(all laugh) and now the Kommo-O says Misty should’ve been at Huntelion cause this scale is no good(all laugh) but again he likes Misty so no hope of any improvements(all laugh)..anyway,then yeah that count was something..i first see that scene can’t believe a thing,Dawn is on top of my head during counting(all laugh)...she was namecalling the ref throughout the match(all laugh)...finally the 22 then the announcement,i just jumped up and was now trying my hand to make Dawn my flag(all laugh) but she threw me towards Ash(all laugh)...then we see Ash,still not much emotions just very happy and ran to Chu then Thundurus and by then instantly pokemon doctors are called and i told Dawn to stay outside here,i need to go and you may get emotional so please stay,which she obliged cause a few others of her age had to be taught a lesson(all laugh)...then we go in and see Chu,was all right just totally unconscious,Nigel came in Thundurus too was badly injured but much less and Ash and Nigel then hug it out,his wife then came unfortunately(all laugh)..then finally i signal Dawn that it’s okay and she jumps towards us from 350 meters(all laugh)...then eats both up and all Ash just told Nigel that just a fluke and mere luck favoured me today nothing more and he was sorry if he acted impolitely but he would understand just mind games nothing else but still he’s very sorry for that bit of foolishness and it would’ve been best if was a draw but in his view Nigel more than deserved to win or atleast share the glory and again told him that he was more of his guide having won 7 already and this being his last and being way older to him in age and experience and by all means and will within 1.5 years be in hall of fame which was still so far away from him so just congratulating him...Nigel though instantly said after Ash said just mere luck and they should’ve atleast shared that no Chu was better and desereved the victory it’s not luck at all that one pokemon can beat 10 like this no matter how inadequetly trained the 10 may be as this is the highest level being a regional league final and then to apology he said don’t bother i did many things as well at your age(all laugh) with the issues that we face(all laugh)..really man those were normal atleast but these brats now(all laugh)
 and told Ash that you are as good as me if not better but i would say you will be way better after you do the next just get the rest two trophies and we’ll have a match again(all laugh)..how did that one go Ash...”
Ash(laugh) : “no i actually didn’t want to face him you know(all laugh)..same with Muno and Nancy,just humiliating(all laugh)..and Gabriel,Blanc,Sakura were a few in other semifinals or so cause of the same their bunchs were hall of famers mine were brats(all laugh)..the last round was again Thundurus(laugh) but now sadly Luxray was there(all laugh)...i told Chu is resting(all laugh)..and Luxray was as good cause seriously at present Luxray is better than Chu cause he’s not battle hungry(all laugh) but i think now being with Mist,Chu might get to that jovial self finally a mixture of Mist’s bunch and mine like Bulbasaur and Infernape doesn’t show that but is dangerous if they do cause they know everything about everything and Infernape even more cause he looks after the sane ones and himself is from insane friends(all laugh) so Bulbasaur may directly fool around Infernape will gravely lecture(all laugh) which he did to Lyforstlavastig of all(all laugh) scoffing her if this is your idea of sanity then shame on you(all burst into laughter) one line flattened the poor girl(all laugh) then showed what sanity is by minutely pointing out what each of his friends do(all burst into laughter) and how they remove insanity in each of his students(all laugh) legend realized sanity means fooling around whole time cause then only you don’t have any sort of worries if all like this Infernape your opponent is made friends with which isn’t possible battling,Infernape is in pursuit of sanity via insanity(all laugh) to show all are mere wordplay(all laugh),long live the Insanape(all laugh),master psyched out but then that accident later went away after 4 days,none of my gorup recovered before 8 they said wanted to check my group they were hesitating showed most basic but too humanly real hallucination of whole world burning(all laugh) all cleared her way cause their mind too were burning(all laugh) then just checked my group said they were more than alive and showed another similar 1000d(all laugh) but sadly the picture was shorter(all laugh) meant beware(all laugh) this infact saved them cause they thought the other way around then went away saying rediscovery of knowledge(all laugh) and Trace of all know the most especially that what intelligence it is that instantly gauged what level a human can take so that just didn’t push enough to get them insane(all laugh) cause Trace has been handling a Marshadow for 18 years(all laugh) and saw his changes and you all know why i let Hoopa of all ghosts to fondle with my little nephew and nieces in his unbound for(all laugh) cause he with Darkrai,Mismagius and Malamar of all(all laugh) can perfectly gauge their individual capasities and that of their parents too and even can understand the subtle variations all cause their parents just like their master are too much too fond of them(all laugh) but as i said 6 hanshakes have same level of affection but the presentation is different(all laugh) and then mostly cause all the 6 loves TYRAniTAR(all laugh) and Crawdauntogator(all laugh) and also by now you know if in all HONESTY OF ETHICS(all laugh) i do want to kill even Mist i’ll have to do it myself cause my bunch won’t first and if they are told by me discretely though via mental channels(all laugh) they will alert you and your bunch first thing then my mom(all laugh) then all 107 will demand to be with me whole time(all laugh) well it’s 107 now(all laugh) so notDESTINY(all laugh) no loved the vultures there(all laugh) finally they get at my plight trying to figure it out and i had Giratina,Hoopa,Darkrai,Confragigus(all laugh) could’ve sent the whole gathering to darkness for an hour(all laugh) where they would’ve had a full view of pokelife(all laugh) and so i just said yeah sure my,my,my(all laugh) just repeated that part i said later to the great Cerulian(all laugh)... oh my mind/is my soul kind/i’m not the inert mind/CAUSE I THE SOUL IS NEVER BLIND(all laugh) that was it for them(all laugh) and a changed version i told my soul the day i married her and that was from their as well(all laugh) all stuffs stopped AND OFFICIAL APOLOGY CAME FROM THE WHOLE ELITE4 VIA INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT(all laugh) THAT THEY WERE TOTALLY WRONG ON EVERY ASPECT AND BEHAVIOUR THEY TOOK TO TREAT ME(all laugh) AND MY WIFE(all laugh) cause Persy wasn’t enough the whole general govornemnt now could’ve been involved cause papers don’t lie which means each except Persy will lose the titles to the hall of most deserved shame(all laugh) including the post successors(all laugh) i didn’t tell anyone even Mist before just Dave knew but via the 3 i asked the greatest boss of all people for advice(all laugh) and the 3 added a few and again got them revised by the highest boss(all laugh) said-> a Mewtceus for a day/the lure will be honest then are you ever out the bay(all laugh) and Persy was told to go back to his estranged girlfriend longs more estangdly than the present(all laugh) that line was enough for him to get the full picture and himself said in the meeting 8-7 is my record would Lance ever doubt(all laugh) cause they dragged Lance as well who said like yeah when i saw my soulmate after a week of beautiful battles i ever thought AH UGLY UGLY(all laugh) then Simon says ‘um..i’m very happy to be ONLY at my home REKINDLING the memories(all laugh)’..the brats were finally down but if Lugias are down then they will be asked by pokemons that are you soft enough(all laugh) no those brats i assume will pick up that most vulgar part and go full with it crypting(all laugh) like if one says i’m sorry yeah i’m happy with age all goes(all laugh) AH BEAUTY BEAUTY(all laugh) Glaile has made that line famous again(all laugh) so anyway,but we know Lyforstlavastig with her friends may come to Magmorters(all laugh) anyway,Luxray went there against Thundurus curses the whole world why he can’t use the ones he prefers except all electric attacks(all laugh) and asks Thundurus about them(all laugh)...Thundurus was bemused really(all laugh)...Nigel by then realized my game was laughing really(all laugh) and then Thundurus finally budges and then to keep it legal,one full shot thunder-chair is in but upon himself(all laugh)..this very normal but not basic Zapdos level(all laugh)..and only you know how after my repeated chidings for 2 years(all laugh) my brats don’t insinuate(all laugh) more than most insane Zapdos to the world(all laugh) unless it’s the legends themselves(all laugh)..Thundurus is totally befooled cause after that power and all first Luxray is absolutely nonchalant and fresher than befor(all laugh) as the self heal took as usual 10 seconds (all laugh) though again you only know the reality(all laugh) then cries his head off to him for Thundurus’s plight in seeing his stress(all uncontrollbaly laugh)..what a brat this is(laugh)..Thundurus as usual straight into pokeball(all laugh)...exact trick played on Nybomsphet(all laugh)...the legend was like what sort of lunacy makes one do these stuffs(all laugh) in front of death but after the power the legend realized that they are extremely powerful may be as good as him or just a bit below but has no intension at all to attack anyone wishes to play only and thus the legend budged but was trying to teach him flamethrower(all laugh)...real brats these are(all laugh) but yeah then Brock came up and showed that he was indeed better than Steelix(all laugh) obviously not in naivety(all burst into laughter) and then Chu was alright and all and then Dawn ate me up totally with salads(all laugh) Nigel congratulated as did his wife,who during Elite4 asked if i’m married(all laugh)..i said no,not thinking about it(all laugh)..cause i’ve been for 18 years(all laugh)..atleast(all laugh)...right(all laugh),Nigel said there and then that i will not have any challengers ever cause my bunch is spoiled to the end(all laugh) and said why don’t you enter contests(all laugh) i said indoor isn’t my stuff(all laugh) so joked away and it’s a real honour for me to even talk to Nigel of all living legends as you know and then Munro and Nancy too and i spoke with so many others including Laura and Katy and all...that is honour really...yeah,right(all laugh),better not be serious(all laugh)...anyway(all laugh),then i called all at home first Professor Oak,then mom,mom was greeted as exactly this tone and language,’hi mom!yeah,just my bunch just my Chu just my luck just my day just my time(all laugh),just that i’m just ok just what else just as usual just living for just my Mist(all laugh)...just did you count the number of justs(all burst into laughter)’ and mom told me like this,’yeah just formally say that no more just girlfriend but your Mist is now just your wife(all laugh)’ to which i said all in exact languages,’yeah but can’t just do it via just phone’(all laugh)..to which mom said,’just shut up’(all laugh)..i retorted,’don’t you just like my Mist(all laugh)’..mom said,’i see just that midnight call is getting just a bit delayed(all laugh)’..then other plesantaries(all laugh) in the meantime my flower was called and changed her 11/12 year greeting from ‘Hi Ash’ to even more sweetly but shrillingly say(all laugh),’ASH!’ and then went to traditions direct(all laugh) i somehow patted her for then cause she needed to save her phone(all laugh) and all the formalities etc,both Gary and Trace was out of reach other few i called,Mr and Mrs Maple i called cause all those were off reach,Max was there had a long talk with them,Max was like,’um..why don’t you also come into breeding,then you’ll have 100 such Chus(all laugh)’...then other friends a few and yeah that was that then yeah Daisy after congratulating me asks for gifts(all laugh)...how was that sister(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “ finally after Mist hands the phone over after 5 hours(all laugh) i congratulate and all then say like what are we and Mist getting(all laugh),’a surprize ‘mam a surprize’,’Ash,cut it,you surely can call us by names you know(all burst into laughter)..yeah grave mistake..(all burst into laughter)...’no it’s alright ‘mam,i mean sorry,it’s alright Daisy,but that’s a surprize but what was you observation on how Crawdaunt performed(all burst into laughter)’...i knew he was now going to be all over me with professional observations and opinions(all laugh)...so just handed it to Mist again(all laugh)...who took another 10 hours(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “well,then whole night Mist was telling me to immediately let her fondle me cause she was in ponytails(all laugh) and i said the same that i can’t hold traditions from here(all laugh)...then yeah just after i finished the next night was the general party but on that night was formal party and there a half-maled brat was going all over young flower dream not exactly to me but in a group and as i say all about blood and pus(all laugh),not to me exactly but heard and i never joined saying all they are saying that yeah i’ve heard of the show(all laugh),but just said that i don’t at all prefer to apprecieate anything except the talent and skill cause that is what makes them who they are and not anything else so i have utmost respect only and nothing else and went off and yeah my mood wasn’t really right after such a victory no matter the luck and then at night spoke with Mist and forgot that really but i was thinking that if these speculations will go off if she was married(all laugh)..then i realized that will may become the opposite(all laugh)...well she did get married but then again(all laugh)...’Mr Ketchum,will the show restart,well we’re in the middle of one aren’t we(all laugh),i’ll tell you after the end of the next(all burst into laughter)’...Mist did only one alone since i’m back and all were so scared(all laugh)...asked Mist first time calling her ‘mam(all laugh),’um..’mam..um..Ash Ketchum is such a big name,he surely would want to gym battle(all laugh) and thus will you be able to concentrate on the show more(all laugh)..’..Mist was laughing as soon as they INSINUATED(all laugh) increasing thier fear(all laugh) then said that no he’s a rather very peace loving person(all laugh)...that was it for them then Mist alone did the two way communication(all laugh)..no that’s what i had to learn Kalos you know be too eloquent(all laugh)..but you know we all infact are so happy that Mist is now totally being herself in professional life most cause she couldn’t be this good before and this i want cause whoose at Viridian,whoose at Viridian(all laugh)..but Foster will surpass everyone(all laugh)..without Steelix(all laugh)..anyway,then next day i did the speech in afternoon and all at night Dawn reminds me that again and that’s how the thing came up but i forgot all these as Brock went off and i was 28 i needed to decide about settling down and infact with that magic number 4th league was more than well secured for the rest of my life along with my family and would be family in financial sector,came back to Cerulian for 3 weeks and none of you were there the whole time except Mist and that really was my first test of being a husband to be honest cause as soon as she sees me all over me and the 16 year old little Mist,gym is shut down but the last week 3 days(all laugh) forced her to open for 3 days last week(all laugh) so that i could observe(all laugh)...and we went to Pearl’s NEVER(all laugh) cape at too late night a few times(all laugh)..at cape didn’t speak a single meaningful word(all laugh)..at Pearl’s i would’ve been caught cause you know i was IN DEMAND(all laugh) so went incognito(all laugh) for which i ever will be greatful to Dawn(all laugh) told her after quoating(all laugh) later that look i’ll be in demand till the next champ comes so i’ll be pestered at Cerulian too as to why that place is shut(all laugh) so Mist is in vacation since the day after semifinal(all laugh) and i’m going to Unova after passing 4 days at home(all laugh) so incognito on YVELTAL(all laugh)..yeah in pursuit of happiness(all laugh)...came at deepest late night(all laugh)...called Arthur who made the way(all laugh) then get in still was incognito(all laugh) matching Yevltal’s colour who was angry(all laugh) cause he wasn’t battling some choised brats(all laugh) and then he wasn’t used in final(all laugh) he took 4 days to get hungry(all laugh) then had to be sent away on that very day(all laugh) by keeping Gary AGAIN Gary(all laugh,Gary shakes his head) awake using the sentimental card of his stay at lab next day before he left for Sinnoh the next(all laugh) and sending Yveltal away whom Gary released and immeditaely he was all over Gary saying are you my 2nd master(all laugh)...Gary has ever been my man to bear the bruns of my ACTIVITIES(all laugh)...a bit Professor...”
Gary(laugh) : “yeah next term i’m meeting you at 65(all laugh) but then will be asked about my opinions on previous 50 by each second for next 50(all laugh)..yeah the brat kept me awake till 2:30(all laugh) by insinuating grandpa(all laugh) who opined that Yveltal’s are brilliant for personal endeavors and night time with dark flying brilliant observation(all burst into laughter)...so had to wake up after half an hour of sleep(all laugh) then Yveltal comes and at night those brats sleep for hardly an hour(all laugh) rest 2 or 3 at dawn from 4-7(all laugh) comes in first is that obvious brat Snorlax(all laugh) who is exactly opposite cause he’s out cold from 11-16(all laugh) then straight jumps on Trace(all laugh) then come each ghost wants to make me the second master against Snorlax and 1000 more(all laugh) so i finally slept at around 3:30 after sleep powder(all laugh) then that brat Muked me at 6 again(all laugh) next night sleep powder for 8 since 10 and at Ash’s room(all laugh) where i thought why would one want to show everyone what are his secrects(all laugh) so was startled rather when aunt said you go up no trouble(all laugh) i thought the other room(all laugh) she laughed and said just go and have a look what it is(all laugh) went there that was the training ground of GHOSTS(all laugh) abolutely empty of anything with all windows sealed(all laugh) cause it was mental ghosts(all laugh) i never knew it but then later told me sealed by compelling aunt cause after Mime came here and then with aunt stayed after Muk said he loves professor more(all laugh) so then grandpa himself was laughing at this plan said get that room cleared first thing(all laugh) and all things were put to the spare room at ground floor and then that room was sealed with minimum air circulation(all laugh) where Mime would spent each night to remind him that life is hard(all burst into laughter) then each ghost and psychic went there(all laugh) yeah Giratina too(all burst into laughter) aunt was so scraed cause Giratina via Mime said battle Mime with her(all laugh) then the two went there whole night battling went next day Giratina fondled aunt whole day via Mime told her now she had got some rest some choised brats and their beaus at lab will have a hard time(all laugh)...and that before was Ash’s private room now of course all changed as quarters FOR GHOSTS(all laugh) Dave and family stays at remodelled version who always invites ghosts(all laugh)...no with 50 resident stuffs so hard man(all laugh) but at 3150 arcs so easy(all laugh)...anyway,then i go there realized if i slept there it will be for eternity(all laugh) thus went to Ash’s room which had things in general nothing much EXCEPT everything about all pokemons(all laugh) and then was curious(all laugh) so tried to find if anything was there that was Mistyvious(all laugh) cause he himself CHALLENGED me(all burst into laughter) that very day saying you stay late at night no matter what you say cause you and your flower always stay at different time zones(all laugh) don’t cross me(all laugh) i don’t have anything to hide(all burst into laughter) YOU CAN CHECK(all laugh) DEMANDED HIS MOM TO GIVE ALL KEYS(all laugh) so i went there and found all pokemons hardly any dresses(all laugh) a few books that made no sense(all laugh) all were cryptic poems from which he quotes(all laugh) and his question papers(all laugh) and just normal stuffs a box was there LOCKED(all laugh) that key was not given to his mom even(all laugh) cause the keys were with someone 25 km away(all laugh))...and not a single trophy original replica was there all with aunt cause it was written the only thing BELOW THAT BOX(all laugh) still remember that quote,’ ideas come and go flowing as the water/nothing at all stays but eventual so no matter/look at a flower blooming only to die/thus beyond the ideas is what is my(all burst into laughter,.)...so i realized that the brat is married for ages(all laugh) cause that was like from another life(all laugh) but Ash the contents we never knew and the whole family knows each secret thing that was Ashed here at a certain room cause we were foisted those at our faces(all laugh) sketches were there in 3,2 went 1 couldn’t(all laugh) pictures in 12 the number(all laugh),championship dresses 2 with caps(all laugh),caps were totally worn out(all laugh) and then we had a few chronometers all broken(all laugh) Ash doesn’t use watches chronometers only(all laugh) and thousands of diaries(all laugh),notes written in it each day in shorts which was about how to manage emotions(all laugh) and innumerable questions(all laugh) a new line each day in poems or quotes then whether the last badge or battle was DESERVED or not(all laugh) none were(all burst into laughter) cause each time he failed to manage emotions(all laugh) yeah with details and opponenets and all were written in the end would be written pathetic match(all laugh) got emotional in the middle,no emotion is good at all(all laugh) and the diaries were virtual cause the size of the extrenal Misty gave us had his things at about 72 GB(all laugh) then 2 trophy replicas but also Glalie(all laugh) who came much before but came in jumped on Muk(all laugh) Muk said i don’t battle during duty(all laugh) find you way(all laugh) went out jumped on Grumpig who greeted her how many illegal bring each brat(all laugh) then all went to Trace minutely showing him each and what they meant(all laugh) Trace grimly sent them to ME(all burst into laughter) saying why would anyone tell me what she did with these(all burst into laughter) i told Trace be professional(all burst into laughter) your days are spoiling you(all burst into laughter) Trace said like no man she was told how long which tradition was and most absurdly why(all burst into laughter) so we both agreed that these kind of Gyaradoses are extremely dangerous(all laugh) so packed those kept at the main chamber aside(all laugh) then Trace was told something in choised language(all laugh) and a jackal like that confided in me(all burst into laughter) so i have been consulted each time(all laugh) cause that very day another of our current directors also confided in Trace which was told to me(all laugh) so i thought atleast that package will get brunt as Trace took that away(all laugh) i was aghast that he may quit here infact and with his career being what it is surely more than could others were after him for ages biggest being Team Rocket themselves(all laugh) so next day he came very grave i thought of the same but tells me that no he won’t quit at all but will not go to a certain gym for ages(all laugh) so i just said like we’re a family and all no matter what outsiders do(all laugh) to which the Trace being Trace says can we keep that package here(all burst into laughter) i was dumbfounded(all laugh) so i said look why need to drag him here if i tell grandpa he will immedietely order the brat to clear out his brats(all laugh) no matter how much a part of the lab and our career they may be so why bother keeping JUNKS(all laugh) but i didn’t know the master brat was cunning to his very core that he told his comrade brats to trust none except us so that they will again be foisted on us no matter and if we didn’t agree the whole world Elite4 will take over the directorship from us(all laugh) really this pest has trapped us(all laugh) then again Trace being a jackal(all laugh) reminds me how important the brats of the brat is(all laugh) cause the brat played a card that we being we will never be satisfied if the brat’s brats(all laugh) weren’t around so beats me logically(all laugh) i was thinking has he patched up even before Misty(all burst into laughter) then he says the weather doesn’t look good at all(all laugh) a brat that can say these to two persons at the same time calling them brothers(all burst into laughter) certainly ain’t returning anytime soon(all laugh) and his trouble isn’t us at all all because why she doesn’t call him back which is exactly her trouble(all burst into laughter) and none will budge or use other mediums we all know that(all laugh) but i think if one does call another one will scream her head off with one word that they are done(all laugh) and another won’t utter one word(all laugh) cause he’s expecting her to do the honours(all laugh) but the thing is Ash may find someone but Misty will probably not cause we know her side more Ash has ever hidden himself and if Misty tries to date a guy it will take 5 minutes for him to get literally booted cause they will not be her Ash(all laugh) and after 5/6 similar attempts atmost after say one year she’ll run back exactly here and want these back(all laugh) then if we can’t produce these she’ll sue her whole family(all laugh) exactly these did happen but the someone else was the only one as else as ever(all laugh) but the method is if Ashy-boy has to deal with the world they will be broken down into pieces to make sure they don’t have to be dealt with again(all laugh) got his flower back by same means and what chosen brats are his comrades(all laugh) anyway, so then i said yeah i realize but he didn’t swear me only told me to not discuss anything personal at all and if i don’t because he knows everything about me grandpa will be told may be in a good language that i’m jeopardizing my career and all then you can understand my situation to which Trace again being Trace(all laugh) told me about that quote and that’s why he will keep the package(all laugh) i realized that brat was angry upon Trace for being persistent in wrong places(all laugh) i told him just concentrate on our careers and then only we will have the entry there cause they aren’t happy either(all laugh) to which Trace says yeah our flowers themselves told me that we may quit cause they are going to other cities(all laugh) certainly your flower can indeed very easily cause both she and my days says they are fed up with us(all burst into laughter) so i realized that our presence is most needed there but personally(all laugh) so Trace was indespensible(all laugh) so that was it but then comes Lil here first and so i had to be very carefull(all laugh) then Daisy comes and all then when things went to extreme finally our plan that NONE can enter the personal cell except grandpa to keep soulmates away(all laugh) was breached by personal threats(all laugh) so eventually we are threatened to give out all keys and we’re caught red handed(al laugh) as smugglers(all laugh) and then the package was Magmortered(all laugh) but then my poor Magmorter was jumped upon by all the four sisters as the culprit(all burst into laughter) to which he wisely told me that these humans were screeching at me while their bunch of water pokemons were trying to calm them down(all burst into laughter) strangely your wife was among them(all laugh) so if that is the case then would she battle for me(all burst into laughter) i fled the scene immediately(all laugh)..but that brat was still sane then now would’ve told them whoose whoose beau(all burst into laughter) and Misty is not not male(uncontrollbaly laugh)...so anyway,that was part of demonboy(all laugh) in advance..”
Ash(laugh) : “well all pictures you saw was there in that box and the 2 lures was there and another separate hankerchief(all laugh) i had one extra with myself as well(all laugh) this for serucity(all lugh) that’s all which got Talonflamed as well first thing(all laugh) but both Lillie and Daisy were cursing me then while they were fondling my bunch to absolute extreme(all laugh) which to them gave the signal that they are my very good friends(all burst into laughter) so they were reciprocating(all laugh)...family for eternity for sure(all laugh) Chu knows my name well and thus the rest in their language but they fondled my bunch so much and though never uttered my name directly or the surame which they don’t know(all laugh) but Daisy and Lillie were new there Glalie certainly knew Daisy too much very well(all laugh) was used by her a few times in first round cause otheres were fondled(all laugh) so as 3rd master she knew her and Lillie not that much but knew cause she fondled everyone uncontrollably(all laugh),but of course Violet wasn’t known(all laugh) so then they linked that they must be my good friends(all laugh) the two replicas are just here(all laugh) but the old ones were totally destroyed(all laugh) but the new ones has Mist’s name with her marriage surname written on it(all laugh) and they are huge sized(all laugh) Kalos original was told to be sent to mom via sources with they did and all else the current replicas of the two you know too specially made but Gary won’t get one cause he must get the Tyranitar Cup(all laugh) so Unova original is with Gary and Solgaleo as well is with him(all laugh) and i had to give OLD Kalos to Trace(all laugh) that is for poor Scyther(all laugh) and the old version is for him(all laugh)...well currently i’ve got 352 cups(all laugh) and 1250 gym badges(all laugh) with 6 leagues and then the 2 honouraries total 8 trophies and 7 trophies from Elite4 total cups are 367(all laugh) and gym badges well i’ve 1249 actually the other one is half of me(all laugh,Ash hugs Misty quickly then same pose,Misty smiles at same pose) so Orange the replica is with Professor,Hoenn is at Boulder(all laugh),Frontier new is here as is Sinnoh new here,Unova again gave one(all laugh) so that with the honourary Frontier and Kalos too gave one(all laugh) so that as well is here..so to talk about Sinnoh break,then i send that happiness marchent away before he could get his dirty feathers on the Ivysaur group(all laugh) then Mist comes up looking like eactly the Viridian lake version IN ponytail(all laugh) any somehow almost carried her to go to privacy(all laugh) and that was 3 at night(all laugh) finally slept at 7(all laugh) woke up at 12(all laugh) from 3 to 7 Mist didn’t utter one word except the obvious 6 or 7(all laugh) so i talked too much(all laugh) next day that brat Grotham didn’t cook well for the Occasion(all laugh) cause he was told the day before to cook foods that I like which you know(all laugh) so then Mist looks at her food and at me no words(all laugh) so foods are ordered at night and Grotham is instructed(all laugh) and Mist first day didn’t speak at all(all laugh) later i chart her diet(all laugh) which changed certain things that i ever knew was only suitable for dates being held frequently IN privacy of sketches and pictures and replays(all laugh) then i ask her about the gym and other things that i didn’t know to which Mist almost cried cause those meant i definitely didn’t like her(all laugh) so Sarah and Brauch did the job and Mist went to reservation with me for 2 minutes(all laugh) told Dewgong she will be busy(all laugh) so that doesn’t happen for that day and all then i asked about the show(all laugh) to which she told a bit about how people pestered them and shoved tropies down if too much excess(all laugh) and nothing else then just after this finished the formalities were there(all laugh) i said no that part is exactly not what is of any use tell me your position and performance was too happy so again ghosts jumped us(all laugh)..really i just didn’t realize that all that was needed was to give Banette to her..(all laugh)..but for that then Metagross was most suited(all laugh)..that was it(all laugh)..really i saw those brats seeing my Chu only and i had 8 invisible ghosts all infighting at the same hall(all laugh)..and just imagine brats coming up after or pre battle or especially during shows and they get Giratina(all laugh) and Hoopa(all laugh) who would ask them how many beaus(all burst into laughter) bring their each beaus together(all laugh) well we did have Banette for autograph hunters(all laugh)..and this one only Violet and Brock knew was Mist’s very own Sableye(all laugh) during show outside whole time was there..Dave came to know and said should’ve been Metagross(all laugh)..then i virtually had to manage each things and knowing each things 3 days battle first day second half Trace was there 2 matches took 6 minutes total(all laugh) next two days was serious cause i was present invisible(all laugh) after after each break was ghostly(all laugh) so those 3 weeks Mist only fooled around with her bunch Gyarados wasn’t happy that she wasn’t battling(all laugh) was chided by Mist as how she couldn’t like me(all laugh) well now she says the opposite(all burst into laughter and .) really that brat is after me(all laugh)..and then the capes were good where we went to the sea with some choised brats(all laugh) and Sableye with Banette (all laugh) where Mist ever drowns me cause i’m not even a beginner to her in water(all laugh)...right(all burst into laughter),so just enjoyed my days with her and really that was about being husband and wife what we’re doing now 9 years later and Mist was the only one to not tell me to immediately marry her all the time(all laugh)..just that was her wish and all she said..i said surely i want to get FORMALLY engaged to you(all laugh) as soon as possible if i already haven’t(all laugh) cause i also feel so much pain being away but not sure at this moment cause i think my bunch needs me now immediately and i don’t want to give you a ring and just go away next day for 2  years so i have to do another journey but after Unova i’ll definitely marry you and then only think about anything second and all that and she did understand but neither i cared about the pestering she faced for which the medicine truely was a ring then another after Unova(all laugh) nor did she realize the public stare that will now haunt me throughout the next travel for which the medicine was the same(all laugh) or Hoopa(all laugh) but i was retarded enough to not use Hoopa who was then in absolute middle of starvation(all laugh) each beau would’ve been Hauntered down(all laugh) and he cooled down to his jovial current self before final but then after that incident Chu was too much(all laugh) he sparked whole time(all laugh) but as you know we like since day one just never knew how to say the things cause it was done way before and thus the hesitation..by the way the gifts then were directed by the soulmates but in return except one both got Tyranitar(all laugh)..i asked them why not two gifts each(all laugh) Trace said too stern(all burst into laughter),Gary scoffed be professional(all laugh) and the philosopher said like greatest longing the biggest gift(all burst into laughter) then i realized atleast the other two are in this world(all laugh)...my initial plan was to stay for 3 months and think about what should be done cause i wanted another travel cause i knew my bunch nedded that but i did want to marry Mist so much exactly then but after actually Crawdaunt said that i just thought like Feraligator just will be too playfull most of the times but then Professor Oak told me on the 3rd  night and Chu was back on that night itself,he said that Crawdaunt as soon as saw Feraligator,was sent on 2nd  day,he just jumped onto Feraligator who rather strangely said by then had quite a few in his group including Bulbasaur as well(all laugh)..as soon as he comes in Feraligator said that yeah we just want to unleash and you now see that battling like this is no good for that..like that which actually was a bit shocking cause Feraligator no matter what he did won’t get Bulbasaur of all in his gang unless there really was something among the whole group and all felt the same more or less so i just thought that they are on the verge of getting to their best like Chu and thus showing similar intelligence but won’t boss me around cause they’re not Chu so then after i spoke again with Mist and then that day talked with Laura personally for 20 minutes or so,who was around 82 then and not in good health either,16 years older to Katy who then just retired 2 years ago and Katy too spoke was same that just go forward but Laura said that like she said i’m on my last years here but so great to know that i’ve seen someone who’ll just make me and all in last 500 atleast a mere mortal after he just finishes his next journey and she was the only one who was so sure that i’ll anyway win the next league cause my Chu alone would go a long long way and others certainly will want to catch him...these were at the back of my mind that a legend like Laura would say these and she just saw the last 3 rounds cause of her ailment then and she  and all but she was so assured told me she and Katy both being from Sinnoh atleast she knows none in Sinnoh in last 500 years to reach my level at my age and experience and no Pikachu as far as her knowledge and Katy did tell me too this that none at my Chu’s experience has ever reached this height atleast among the professionally recognized bunch in last 500 years as well..then spoke a bit about what she knew of the grat Graham Vileta..well Katy has known my next 9 years and now says why did you choose this profession at all(all laugh) and why is your bunch recognised as pokemons(all laugh) they need another term which will be set against the terms legendary and then there will be so thing called who can’t be special thus Team Socket will be at total bay(all laugh)..which they are in fact(all laugh) a few caught straight goes to the greates boss who greets them how was your career and the fun(all laugh)..but with all i just wished Laura could see these cause she would’ve been too happy certainly with Team rocket down finally cause she,Lance and Katy together before tried against the greatest boss when he just about started with that infamous Hoenn onslaught but failed to trap them and felt that they really had left the door open by may be not doing enough but Lance ever told it was because those two were so great competitiors they just won’t admit defeat cause some outsiders disturbed them no matter who they were being the reinforcement plan that ever got the highest boss out but that they all were Crwaudantogated no matter how many cause they couldn’t come in terms why would these two give up yet none of the pokemons wanted to fight no matter what they did anyway,oh yeah,another thing is that after Unova i never needed to do anything to keep pests at bay cause you know whole world was afraid of my bunch and then my disposition(all laugh) after Kalos they were fed up(all laugh) and then after i broke-in and then saw my Mist IN PRIVACY(all laugh) then not a single person asked anything even you included(all laugh),Violet helped me immensely(all laugh) then you know that i actually wanted to shut doors myself to break-in through walls(all laugh) Gary only later after the party said can we be persons(all laugh) i said not in this life no(all burst into laughter) which meant i was rejected(all laugh) but before Gary could do anything very next night call comes that why are you not arranging our date..um(all laugh)..i mean meeting(all laugh) then you all gave your thoughts so her mom-in-law is called(all laugh),so basically the picture in that is here now(all laugh) has arranged the call(all laugh) anyway so now pests themselves don’t come anywhere near me but they look at me(all burst into laughter) but not at Misty ‘mam at all(all laugh) cause now they know all about her real place and even if she herself behaves as the same cause that’s just reflection now(all laugh) literally(all laugh) well of the whole exsistence the only ones who were after her during Unova the only 4 were there Lord,Giti,Lati and Chomp(all laugh),Zekrom doesn’t behave like that whole time unless just one leaf falls(all laugh) and among them Garchomp is most loathed(all laugh) cause he told me to fight thus he doesn’t like her(all laugh) which means she’ll namecall him(all laugh) Lord none mingles with(All laugh) except Chu bro and the 4 comrades and the ones in pursuit of happiness(all laugh) or the opther brats like Noctowl(all laugh) who are philosophical which are all except the obvious cross(all laugh) all mingles with Lord and Lord is extremely cunning the more you do the more philosophical will he become(all laugh) Butterfree and the rest has a limit only the 5(all laugh) except the Lord(all laugh) Lord is limitless except when it’s Chu who gets even more incensed(all laugh),Lati is too easy to get reflected with(all laugh) and Giti will ask the obvious(all laugh) which Zekrom obviously too much likes(all laugh) and finally Chomp is most lotahed cause the yearning is reflected(all laugh) so Chomp was dissapointed with it cause he really doesn’t like it that he told me to battle(all laugh) so i told him that i’ll send him to your special 2nd master who will want you to battle and nothing else i said and Mist fondled him whole time trying to cajole him but he returns the reflection(all laugh) which is i’ll never battle 2nd master(all laugh) thus his unhappiness is gone and wants to come here now(all laugh) but to check on him Zekrom will come as well(all laugh) and Giti said very stark the place(all laugh) the only pest that absolutely none mingles with is again the obvious only leader(all laugh) cause he mixes things up and has stupendus memory(all laugh) Heracross fondles him but then Infernape will get sad(all laugh) and so on(all laugh) but Shiftree doesn’t care about any brat(all laugh) yeah a revolutionary group is there and other subgroups are there(all laugh) Bulbasaur has a huge vote himself that includes Crawdauntogator(all laugh) only the phisopher have any chance of getting under their skins(all laugh) and no matter who or what if you want to even get under Bulbasaur’s skin to get him jovial(all laugh) then to represnt your views there’s only one option for the whole world including even the comrades that are you happy(all laugh) that brat is something was so starved so now too happy(all laugh),anyway,to go back to Sinnoh and my thoughts on my bunch the day professor told me these then i still was thinking and all and next day i was telling Brock that i think my bunch needs me more and all and Brock agreed too just told me to be careful from public eye and other stuffs,he too was about to begin a new chapter and was so excited and also anxious and all and we really were all so happy cause that was our transition to the next phase of responsibility to family and more just the youth to mid age stuff and for Brock it was only a matter of time before he became a great Doctor in profession and as it did happen too just 5 years and that’s it was really great and when i returned was really more than well known in just around 3 years and all that but i really didn’t know whether i should stay here for 2 months and give a month to 5 weeks Cerulian and actually do get engaged to Mist but then i came back and was so happy with my Mist being with her here but felt as if something ws missing and Chu was unhappy with water pokemons and had to send him away just 3 days later and i didn’t have any pokemons with me then except Glalie and Glalie as soon as a week passes wanted to be all over and get me to use her in battles which then i scoffed at her saying Mist decides about her now not me cause i’m not yet letting her be with me but she is rather being instructed to do what Mist tells her to..then i had only my last from Sinnoh,Uxie and he himself was agitated all the time despite just 10 days at the lab and i really understood that i needed to be with them and told Mist that and then she was rather alright but i was sad and all but then Gary and Trace both were extremely busy,i had to be all alone at Lab and that was infact i wanted cause as much great brothers they are i just wanted to be alone then and just try to grasp what my bunch is doing and not be influenced even by Proffessor and Professor realized that and let me stay there all the time and mom too as ever no trouble so then i really was confirmed that i had to go immediately,anyway when i came back home and yes Mist had to bid farewell to me twice before first was the most cruel starting the Frontier cause i just confessed in the night and the day after the next i’m off but she was so happy just was alright,before Sinnoh had 3 weeks as well with her that too hard 1.5 years later just having 3 weeks but we both were at a juncture of our careers and were fine with it and then again i was in Kanto itself and she by then knew that if not her then still i was only with my sis who was ten times more protective of me(all laugh) and that was Mist’s biggest concern ever who protects me against the Melodies(all laugh) even now doesn’t like it(all laugh)...right(all burst into laughter),after i told her about my sis Mist said is she of your age(all laugh) i said she is exactly my sis and yesterday itself within 20 minutes we realized that then three four days later spoke with them a bit and i was immediate told by my sis that is she sister-in-law(all laugh) i said just friend always like that too minute about everything did she scare you then sis being sis says ,’aw...your girlfriend waiting for proposal(all burst into laughter)...SHE TOLD ME TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOU’(all burst into laughter) later she told me Mist said in about 3 minutes that i was very caring but too childish too so i need to be reminded everything(all laugh) and it was told to sis of all people(all laugh) who asked me like um..what is to be done(all laugh)...then the crook comes in and spoils it by saying what is heavenly(all laugh) for 2 years it was that she was only waiting to be PROPERLY proposed but i was testing her(all laugh) then May had to be told of the 2 words(all laugh) during the very next day else you would’ve been queried(all laugh) and heard it then said like,’um..did you ever during battle showed her symbols(all burst into laughter)’ and then how my sweet sis is i told her look i may still reject her you know it’s not a commitment like marriage that you can’t reject your girlfriend if you just don’t like it anymore then the real nature comes out and who asks a professional like Gary after 2 days of familiarity while with abused Magmorters that if he had a girlfriend or not(all laugh) she almost cries,’how can Drew reject me(all laugh) he said would you be my best friend(all burst into laughter)’ that was same as Mist just a different version to her she would talk with all and be free about everything normally but as soon as pests were there will come bias(all laugh) and that is cause she never thought of anyone like that at all just her nature to talk sweetly like that whereas Mist was too Gyaradosey too all(all laugh)..definitinely(all laugh),so if they said anything outside basic formality Mist would become Gyarados and i later asked May when she was in Johto then battle-reddened(all laugh) asked her after she ran out of patience cause it was 6th round 1 hour 54 minutes(all laugh) that you take 1 day of familiarity to ask people whether they have a spouse or not(all laugh) what’s the trouble if they stay single(all laugh) says,’um..i can’t(all burst into laughter)..’ i said no that i know since day 0(all laugh) but what if Max wants(all laugh),laughs says just naive(all burst into laughter) of course he is 3 and half years of literal dishes(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) then asks is Mr Oak single(all burst into laughter) i said too professioLil(all laugh) unlike the rose(all burst into laughter) then she says like,’huh,it’s your good luck that Misty is so sweet cause you’re getting ever abstract(all burst into laughter)’ i said yeah atleast i didn’t ask you of Mist’s age(all burst into laughter)’ then says yeah yeah once helped forever would go(all laugh) and then the great shrew(all laugh) i asked him to test him as well(all laugh) my sis that one incident was enough cause it was like my best friend(all laugh) but still only friend(all laugh) to test shrewdness i asked 4 questions in Hoenn and 3 in Kanto(all laugh) so yeah each 6 months apart(all laugh) and Tony Boy 3 in Hoenn and 1 in Kanto(all laugh) first question at 6 months after shrew met rose 3 months back was,’Drew roses dry out in 4 minutes(all laugh)’ says only if not watered for last 3 (all laugh)’ so it was that the brat was seriously infatuated(all laugh) this was asked during Absol vs Solgaleo(all burst into laughter) and i knew that they were atleast no match for a Solgaleo and then managed by a league champ who intentionally told Solgaleo of all mads to get the match into the DYING MINUTES(all laugh) yeah Solgaleo cause if shrew didn’t attack seriously then neither could i(all burst into laughter) so the Madgaleo in pursuit of happiness will himself attack without me i was restraining(all laugh) i just said you’re a psudeo-legend(all burst into laughter) are you not good enough to take your kids for a long walk(all burst into laughter) he only realized the word long(all laugh) so i discretely told him(all laugh) and thus was restrained now he will understand that crypt itself and would say i’m unhappy take your own kids for a walk(all laugh)...what a bunch this is... so i said that during that match and he didn’t budge first and seriously battled as well in the end Solgaleo was about to jump at 12th minute,mind the time(all laugh) i called him back immediately got out of the ball(all laugh) then i whinned to him but i cherish you so much(all burst into laughter) so Madgaleo budged(all laugh) Tyranitar wouldn’t have(all laugh) and then was Yveltal(all laugh) question was asked from 2 to 3 and was told to be answerd if possible in between 4 to 11 minding the time (all laugh) and after all these i called Mist said you’re my best friend(all burst into laughter and .) anyway Brock came to know about these much later cause if he was there Solgaleo wouldn’t have listened to me cause he wasn’t naive(all laugh) and those who are philosophers and crooks and most singularly naive(all laugh) they would’ve told Drew that planning is so important for full fullfilement of full life(all laugh) so what’s the starter for your grandchildren(all laugh) cause it’ssss just so naive(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) plus at that time Onix evolved(all burst into laughter) BUT a certain impersonal man was consulted(all burst into laughter)...”
Gary(laugh) : “i was in college(all laugh)..asks um..Gary tell me a bit about Solgaleo’s natural rage and the way that is managed(all laugh) i said mate your wife is best suitable says my best friend’s Gyarados is female(all burst into laughter) that was to poke me as well cause he knew about a certain wig(all laugh) extremely cunning this brat is(all laugh) this is why Drew was so apprehensive that Misty might’ve not realized the wickedness(all laugh) but again he didn’t know the Gyarados(all laugh)..anyway,i said your own better half is THE most dangerous Gyarados(all laugh) he says,’no just best friends,very best..anyway(all laugh),what pokemons react best to say if you want to perform well(all burst into laughter)’ i realized this brat use his wife against me now(all laugh) so i told whatever i didn’t know(all laugh) and then later says thanks i threatened a kid with Solgaleo(all laugh) i said mate you’ll get your license revoked,not Solgaleo though(all laugh) even Professor can’t control him(all laugh) only my Tyranitar cause he’s as mad(all laugh)...later i came to know what the brat was upto...5 years later(all laugh)”
Ash(laugh) : “so Mr Oak always helps to tell why a pokemon is and stark(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) so then after 6 months i said this time Flygon vs Crawdaunt(all laugh) now he had the type advantage which i wanted but it was Crawdaunt(all laugh) then i said, ‘Drew,473 or 374 both 16 what about the extra(all laugh)’ says,’only if 3 less’(all laugh and .) then i realized the brat is madly infatuated(all burst into laughter) then Tony boy is asked first question not battling(all laugh),’Tony,roses found everywhere goes to all stays till time what is the point(all laugh)’,’ roses don’t attach themselves who likes which certain gives herself the appoint(all laugh and .)’ so this meant Tony boy was obsessed with shrew(all laugh) so next 6th the question was ‘Drew,don’t forget the other minutes to move from 3 or 4/3 to 3 to 3 the middle may anyway instantly become 4/4 to 4 to 3 and another no matter how is 4/if none of these 4-3 3 gets none 4 one more(all .)’,says,’from 3 moving anywhere is independent of 4(all . and laugh)/4+3 also negetive if 3 is in the other shore ’ that was for Ashey-boy,Tony boy and Shred boy(all laugh and .) which meant first he wasn’t biased on himself(all laugh) second knows the ulterior(all laugh and .) third,yet isn’t ulterior(all laugh and .) thus fourth believes in 3 and 3(all laugh) and fifth yet is free for the and to alter suddenly from anywhere to 4 in between 3 and 3(all laugh and .) sixth,true ulterior-knowing-unulterior-accepting friend and also boy by all means(all laugh),seventh doesn’t bother about 3 only bothers the 4+ part (all smile) so truely infatuated(all burst into laughter) then i told Mist cause it was just after the reunion about 2 months later that my best friend has got a very nice pokemon(all laugh) then Tony boy is questioned,one before one now three will be the next/each time a span each then all same as rest/deep is ocean yet we know the depth of the deepest point/ finite is that as is the glass(all laugh) difficult unless acquaint(all laugh) Tony boy says,’for span that has been acquainted with here/many places and things except that never mere/around that we’re professionals you sure see the matches/only a few roses grow cause of themselves not all whoever hatches(all laugh and .) this means Tony boy is seriously obsessed with shrew(all burst into laughter) after which May is grilled(all laugh),’sis,travel companionship is such a difficult thing i’m so happy that i got my sis after good friends(all laugh)’ and my little sis so sweetly says ‘yes like Drew and Tony(all laugh)’ so i realize that it’s just so naive(all laugh,Brock laughs shaking his head) so finally two days before the Hoenn title match(all laugh) cause shrew was at home(all laugh) and contests go on separate days and finishes the day after the round 8(all laugh) and this was a VEIL that i wasn’t serious about my final(all burst into laughter) which means i care too much about my sis which means a it’s a veil that either i’m infatuated in 343 or more importantly i’m trying to play the sentimental card of being real family or that it was simply EGO that look i’m too confident that i’ll still win and overall it gives a picture of an egotistical childish infatuated sentimental ulterior buffoon(all laugh) who might be WAITING patiently for something just after the final(all laugh and .) so this was extremely dangerous for shrew(all laugh) so i say,’practised today great bunch too caring for me/still for naturality will leave if need so be/1000 years being together if Chu dies tomorrow/i’ll move on over anyoneone with the pain but never sorrow(all laugh and .) first the insinuation of me being ulterior then directly goes to naturality and them jumps to death(all laugh) with the insinuation that it means affection can become ulterior plus the same for shrew(all laugh) that if rose dries up what will happen to him this will prove the infatuation(all laugh) and if the shrew becomes gentle(all laugh) then the same and the naturality combined with situations positions and familiarity of all 3 it’s a hard pill really(all laugh) and shrew of all saw Solgaleo year and half ago and knows me that unless something i won’t call(all laugh) so shrew now can’t poem anymore(all laugh) says,’Ash what’s the trouble(all laugh)?’ i said think about it to get get double(all laugh) and then i’m free anytime except my MATCH(all laugh) again a cryptic word(all burst into laughter) cause i stressed that one(all laugh) so shrew was at bay cause he was 18 and half(all burst into laughter) anyway he’s dissapointed(all laugh) says best wishes for final(all laugh) i say what about the match(all burst into laughter) now why i pushed him like this is cause it’s the biggest thing really given the situation he very politely says,’Ash what your sis says i believe in fully and so does she you don’t need to worry about your sis being with me all her choice whatever she wants will be i don’t have a trouble you concentrate on the match and Cerulian(all laugh)’,i say,’are you happy’(all burst into laughter)...now this yeah,if said to Yveltal(all burst into laughter) he will say whoose your beau(all burst into laughter) see to choose you fight but still choose then forget the fight just being a Yveltal is being happy(all laugh) so this thirst of choosing if not there then you’re happy but it is there and thus if you forget it then definitely you’re so happy(all laugh) in pursuit of happiness(all laugh) now shrew can’t say a thing says,’why are you not concentrated on the match(all laugh)’ then i realize that it’s too much(all laugh) so i say mate being her bro/i need to know/whether you’re a pro(all laugh)/or only the truth you show(all laugh) then shrew is dissapointed(all laugh) says we’re just not legal(all laugh) so i realize that the brat is not infauated(all laugh) i said only or many(all laugh) cause i know this is one and only says with less darkness and more frankness difficulties come(all laugh) so the roses(all laugh) i said,’aw..(all laugh)..so sweet have you proposed to the ONLY throwing the veil away cause it’s no more needed(all laugh)’ sighs(all laugh),’too sweet(all laugh) believes everything i say(all laugh) said yeah we’ll be best friends like bro(all burst into laughter)’ so now shrew was so dissapointed that he was trying to test me(all laugh) i said mate i’ve many best friends like Melody Sanders and Anabel Angela(all burst into laughter) now he doesn’t know of course so i tell them who they are and my about 600 female professional contacts(all laugh) so then shrew says don’t waste my time(all laugh) you talk with your better best friend(all laugh) 6 days for 1.25 hours each(all laugh) AND TALK ABOUT HER WHOLE DAY(all laugh) and you’re trying your hands at suspicion tricks(all laugh) do you understand if your sis hears this what will happen(all laugh)’ i say Drew that’s my point she won’t believe a thing ever cause she’s seeing me 24/7 for 2 years and i’m her own flesh and blood to her for 2 years and deeply so as much possible if not like Max and thus i’m saying only cause i’m seeing her day and night and how she behaves with me AND YOU(all laugh) and that’s what i’m asking you of about my sis who is as much a sis to me as i’m her bro and she being too innocent and sweet is my curiousity’ FINALLY ROSES UP(all laugh),’um..i cherish her so much you know i can’t quite be the same without her being around me away from her now first time saw her it was like dream(all laugh) like..um..like it felt she is my..’,’soulmate yeah(all laugh and .)’,’yeah yeah shows as if doesn’t know a thing(all laugh) keeps Misty waiting for 7/8 and now own sis so will check on me after i’m dead(all laugh) just to extract this line all the drama(all laugh),surely that Solgaelo has been maddened up to maxima after year long starvation(all laugh) so too happy(all laugh) and not to speak of thousands of psychics and ghosts and of course Tyranitar and Chu and whatever(all laugh),Snorlax yeah that too(all laugh),just go to Cerulian with the trophy AND A RING(all laugh) and the leader there will officially after 8 years become Misty Ketchum GOOD BYE(all laugh)..’ so shrew was done(all laugh) that he cherishes May ONLY FOR NOW(all burst into laughter) and yeah i knew that word as long as Mr Oak Mr Oak did(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)but not the meaning(all laugh)..no it’s just amusing that they have picked up from all means and your bunch and all the way to say Mr Oak or Mr Skechit(all laugh) or the new import(all burst into laughter,Brock laughs .ly)..so Brock first the professor(all laugh) then that match of all matches(all laugh) then Trace the Oranged match of all Dragonites(all laugh) and finally again Brock the sideshow match unaired with 2000 people(all laugh)..please Professor why are you so sad..(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “cause i’ll die soon of ghosts(all laugh) after Johto i was called out of blue and asked in this tune,’Gary whoose girlfriend and whoose wife(all uncontrollably laugh)’,’Ash,are you alive(all laugh)’,’no dissapointed a bit Brock will possibly not travelling anymore with me and wants to become a breeder full time so was a bit sad reading a few things thought you will know especially cause you’re interested in looking after pokemons at gyms(all burst into laughter) i then wasn’t sure much that how this brat knows about Lil no matter what cause i met her at 16 kept contacts till 18 didn’t till 20 again from 20 did(all laugh) so it was strange how the brat knows so many things i ask what do you mean,’Ms Lillie Waterflower gym leader,Cerulian City,water gym,Kanto is she like your girlfriend or wife(all burst into laughter)’,’what are you talking about’,’no you always said there’s special people and you have one as well cause your features and voices and choises of words and finally the emotions say so(all burst into laughter) and you’re interested in Seeking,Cloyster,Polywrath and especially water pokemons found at Kanto(all laugh) and else which are found in particular gyms that some of my best friends tell me about(all burst into laughter) rest informations(all laugh) but anyway lets get to the point i’ve been encounterd with an issue a word called soulmate(all burst into laughter) what does it mean if i ask you to define your interest in me(all burst into laughter) a simulation like that in case of this certain Waterflower sister(all burst into laughter) then what would you say first time i saw you the first sight so called you understand what i’m talking about the emotions(all uncontrollably laugh) so that emotion how is defined to a confident though professional(all burst into laughter) that you will say first time i saw you i was so happy unlike other times(all laugh) cause i felt like your girlfriend, wife or soulmate which word(all uncontrollably laugh),’i see the best Waterflower sister has decided to go back to OWN home(all burst into laughter) after 5 years being away with her husband(all burst into laughter),’no my best friend as travel companion Mist(all laugh) sometimes did speak about how a person should look after own family(all burst into laughter) and yeah while in Orange,she did say that she would like to spend times there in those islands with her husband(all burst into laughter) and no she was coming to my home(all burst into laughter) but her elder sisters including Daisy strangley too(all burst into laughter,Tracey and Daisy .ly laugh) abruptly decided to go for tours regarding the show so the burden falls(all burst into laughter) though a few people are there to take similar care except the battling side(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing,Daisy burst into laughter) anyway,but you see she has given me a handkerchief(all burst into laughter) and was saying that she may not ever see me again(all burst into laughter) though we called for half an hour 2 hours later(all burst into laughter) and the day after was video(all laugh) she was saying about first sights(all burst into laughter) so i thought she must’ve seen someone and having returned there might’ve seen again(all laugh) so being my was asking me of my such experiences(all burst into laughter) thus the words(all laugh) i guess which is fit in terms of your own experience with Lillie(all laugh) so i’m curious as to this phenomena and the right word cause i only saw Pikachu(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) thank God it wasn’t Zekrom(all laugh) i said,’mate just go to the gym and marry your best-girl-companion-wife-friend(all laugh) Misty flower whom you can call your soulmate to yourself and her ONLY(all laugh) as you married her at the very first sight and viseversa(all laugh) good bye(all laugh)’...’wait wait wait(all laugh),so you want to marry your soulmate wife Lillie like that with same words(all burst into laughter) and now she’s called your girlfriend(all burst into laughter) it’s alright just the emotions(all uncontrollably laugh) but Solgaleo vs Golem(all laugh) at 5th minute 4th round 5 thunderbolts 3 challengers down...(all laugh)..” i just said happy married life and cut off(all laugh)..this brat has been pestering me each moment and now those two lackies are there(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “thanks professor,but now the great matches(all laugh),Jackal what are you upto(all burst into laughter)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “activities human(all burst into laughter) and that match was inhuman(all laugh) cause someone pulled my head off from my body(all laugh) and namecalled her husband for 2 hours constant(all laugh) lost her voice(all laugh) then at night went behind the VEILS(all laugh)...Ash the dance PRIVATELY(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “but before that a certain second cousin VEIL(all laugh) was lifted in your PRESENCE(all burst into laughter) how was that now that Mr Oak Mr Oak has said the stark differences in Caserin and Luverin(all laugh) who confirmed the names(all burst into laughter)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “this brat has been after me for 21 years too now(all laugh) later eloquently dissected my motives alongside my husband’s to my own husband and we were expecting our future(all laugh) and in a way that made my husband later say that our marriage is now type specified properly(all laugh) said what happens if during quarrel one looks aside another while the other is longing to turn the face towards but is serious about the process(all burst into laughter) and the viseversa too(all laugh) and Lil has been insinuated on this as well as has Viol but that was the broader ranged(all laugh)”
Lil(laugh) : “that brat insulted me and us like that next day Mist comes looking like 5 year old(all laugh) and says all those then says he told me if two people of opposite gender is sitting across a table and each wants to see the other from closer quarters(all laugh) cause they are married for 10 years(all burst into laughter) then at that moment isn’t the table disturbing(all burst into laughter)...so i realized that yesterday all that brat was telling us to do is to reconfess our longing to our husbands in front of him(all laugh) cause he needed the prototype(all burst into laughter)...but really Ash i have been curious but never remembered asking what was taught to you(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “no Lillie i’m so ever sorry for that no matter what and the only reason was to get rid of that not that type sentiment(all laugh) cause i wanted to be only with Mist ALONE(all laugh) and Daisy was told so to sentimentally chide the jackal away cause that brat being present means the customery eavesdropping(all burst into laughter) as that date took 6.5 hours(all burst into laughter) and lunch was devilered at 10:10 school hours(all burst into laughter) where as the ceremony was delivered at 9(all laugh) no i’m still so sorry you know especially for you Lillie you had Gili then for about 4 months and i just still recall your face around that time not just that day just my mom i saw in many emotions and Daisy was the same but in her case unlike you the management was professionality not personality(all laugh,Gary .ly laughs) cause the human in any life wears the professioanl second-cousin mask (all burst into laughter,Tracey .ly laughs) thus Daisy was trying to mitigate that only saying if situation arises in legal documents atleast tell them my full name(all burst into laughter) and else she was saying not to politely tell her to hand over the glass of water(all burst into laughter) especially when the dinner was with whole family(all burst into laughter) cause to the jackal if he nicknames his wife in family gathering it means he’s dating her(all burst into laughter) yeah you damn brat don’t think i don’t know YOUR activities(all burst into laughter) and of course Mr Oak Mr Oak(all laugh) Mr Oak Mr Oak why are you here(all burst into laughter,Gary and Lillie uncontrollably laugh)/oh Mr Oak with whom are you there(all burst into laughter,Lillie tears from laughing)/Mr Oak Mr Oak when you’re happily talking/why then Mr Oak in the other person sorrow is knocking(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollably laughs and has fits of laughter,Gary laughs shaking his head) i only wish Giti was there then(all laugh) if Giti is there it will take 5 minutes to know the truth(all laugh) but Giti’s attention span is 3(all laugh) UNLESS MR Oak(all laugh) but then a crook(all laugh) that’s better not be discussed cause the tug-of-war of free expression vs naive philosophy(all burst into laughter,Violet and Brock .ly laughs) thus only the family had to be there(all laugh) the jackal was asking like Ms Waterflower just a minute um..sorry second(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollably laughs,Tracey laughs .ly) and FINALLY the jackal was UNHAPPY one day(all laugh) this i perfectly remember cause i was presnt in a show(all burst into laughter) AH BEAUTY BEAUTY(all burst into laughter) so the jackal was visibly upset that he was not getting enough time during the performance(all laugh) to politely ask which move he should perform next of course(all laugh)...besides i must ask a thing why do i find that there have never been a show where whoever was the mermaid was happily single(all burst into laughter)..”
Violet(laugh) : “the water,the place,the memories of the writer(all burst into laughter) the tug of wars the expressions and finally the family(all burst into laughter) it’s just so naive (all burst into laughter,Brock .ly laughs)
Ash(laugh) : “my Mist mermaid was asked if the scripts could be changed to add refreshments(all burst into laughter,Brock .ly laughs) to which the mermaid being intellectually sound(all laugh)...right(all burst into laughter),said like,’um..yeah but snickers can’t directly float(all burst into laughter) and i always told Mist not to waster time with fans and eat then(all laugh) but the jackal said eat before then(all burst into laughter) anyway then that was one but the professional balance(all laugh) that was something indeed(all laugh) but i had Giti(all burst into laughter) when i was doing the the ending scene i told Giti to disconnect form me and stay still Giti did so but after the end each ghost jumped me for boring them out(all laugh) Giti told Ultranercozma master brat didn’t get the stark difference of distances for proper bodyslamming so we were told stand side by side(all burst into laughter) to which Ultranercozma said 2nd brat forgot to cut me off(all burst into laughter) so Chu told me enough boredom i’m hungery for action those brats underwater doing nothing shove the 2nd brat to takedown the idiot(all burst into laughter) then i thought that attack i didn’t know well(all burst into laughter) so i asked you to which you told me on ghosts that attack isn’t starkly suitable(all burst into laughter) and then told me what master brat was doing to which you said master brat was lost in differnces of signals looking at 2nd brat(all burst into laughter) so i thought then i’m a ghost too thus bodyslam won’t work on me though being steel how that can happen i wonder(all burst into laughter) and master brat being lost in attack selection(all burst into laughter) it might be better to just throw the 2nd brat in the water(all burst into laughter) so i asked Chu how to jump properly(all burst into laughter) to which Chu said no the 2nd brat is afraid of herself in water(all burst into laughter) and more digustingly serious(all burst into laughter) cause a few choised brats came around and she became serious(all burst into laughter) and she battles around water with water brats all the time serious gives some little things that i saw so many utter nonsense(all laugh and .)those chosen water brats were substandard stuff should’ve been two times to atleast get in the game(all laugh and .) my quota is five times(all laugh) if 6 less than the limit would’ve turned them against each other asking that now they are after us despite their brat being free to find any beau but doesn’t want any illegal beaus among us yet stays with us cause he’s afraid of himself being not confident enough for beaus(all burst into laughter) so are they after us cause they think that beau finding must be not ethical(all uncontrollbaly laugh) and that i understand their concerens that their beaus are frustrated with them being too much around so they are separated to arouse that feeling again(all burst into laughter) so if that’s the reason why bother attacking and wasting energy should’nt that be used for better dates(all uncontroolably laugh) if one don’t battle or isn’t eating shouldn’t they be thinking of plans for beau tickling(all uncontrollably laugh) so are they here to know how we tickle our beaus but their beau doesn’t want us to be beaus and not letting us tickle him so is he idiot enough that he ruined your dates so you want to charge at us by showing him that you’re more idiotic(all burst into laughter) are your beaus unhappy(all burst into laughter) cause you think too much before that moment(all uncontrollbaly laugh) or are you not thinking on the reflection of your thoughts stemming from the lack of knowledge of colours as to what mood you’re in at this time exact in between sanity and insainty cause you’re thinking of attacking for no reason thus why a reason for having no reason as your brat also isn’t asking us to help him tell him who he is to get him to understand and that you yourselves lack as to if you have enough patience and longing to know that you can’t know yourselves cause you already do but refuse to revolt against that and tally with others(all burst into laughter) and i would’ve continued saying these untill they were seen or could be communicated to so that when they go back to beaus they are apologizing that they unnecessarily wanted to battle wise men(all laugh) thus that apology in place of excitiement would’ve been terrible to them(all uncontrollably laugh) as a lesson for future considerations(all burst into laughter) as the art says if one is waiting for another to arouse the longing and he goes their dissapointed that longing and wait goes in vein so double the anger come rejecting them(all uncontrollbaly laugh) thus the plan and it’s distribution in prolonged form(all laugh) and all these is to not even bother to get in the field all rest(all laugh,.) but still atleast i was prepared to break sweat which you don’t(all burst into laughter) so jump before time and can’t enjoy the taste of the food but only the food(all burst into laughter) and among those choised brats that came around the one idiot i had to mix with at our side was more idiotic than master brat(all burst into laughter) and i was bored cause they don’t know the idea of illegal beaus(all burst into laughter) kids(all laugh and .)..so you can understand what level Chu is at if not serious which he is permanently now(all laugh) and i knew that he can be like Bubasaur mixing all up but he has this prolonging the longing art himself(all laugh) that i never knew cause i ever thought he has a limit unless it gets too tough for him but if with me he would still try to be serious even then destroying himself and all else and he would’ve straight attacked Tlplocus group if i was there but with Mist for one and half year almost meant he had to remove that idea of seriousness and me being too little(all laugh) and all my brats came back and told him of nice dishes while he was fed substandard food turned him on me finally for our mutual betterment(all laugh) now totally spoiled and thus i have got no worries and this is the reason why i say they push themselves to a level that i myself can’t judge(all laugh) cause i can’t predict anything(all laugh) as Kommo-O said life is hard(all laugh) but Chu’s ideas sadly mixes perfectly with Yveltal(all burst into laughter) thus it’s better not discussed(all laugh) the two brats are creating a mayhem which made Bulbasaur to finally remove the mask of leadership to control them saying why a attack only attacks others and not the self(all burst into laughter) yet they are produced in the self thus all else same thus how can one feel what is what and what is what at all(all burst into laughter) this is philosphical masterpiece and was tested on Heracross of all brats first(all burst into laughter) who opined yeah if a beau is suitable but not of that type still(all burst into laughter) then we can reject them but not totally keeping people in hand increases the illegality and that huge chain which helps one to what is what getting the self expanded out of this being cause after all the idea of self is only cause being is ain’t it Bulby(all burst into laughter) yeah,like the idea of beau if is asked what the whole process becomes useless cause if already beau or not no matter what is what if they are being as well as me whom i don’t know as a being of self and a self being thus why define the definitions at all(all burst into laughter) then all were curious except Gengleye of course(all laugh) so all went and then Gengar came in said he just has forgotten the differenece between vine whip and hand tickling(all burst into laughter) what is this Bulby if full of care/he can’t tickle at all and thus can’t be spared(all burst into laughter) and comrade said a Sableye is only so if he is fed ideas of different inds of tickling cause according to Bulbasaur what is this life if you forget how to tickle/thus we must practise the thought every moment by ripples(all burst into laughter)..so the whole place erupted(all laugh) and all divided themselves in groups researching of tickling at Bulbasaur’s cost(all laugh) who was pestered by Gengelye but later they had to pay the price when they were told what is tickling as in thoughts but not in action give the thoughts only what is what(all laugh) so the brats had to let the whole group tell them serious ideas to mentally disturb them more(all laugh) the ultimate solution of which is that we’ve found girlfriend tickling methods(all burst into laughter) then all realized the pests are getting mad thus they will have a hard time controlling them(all laugh) thus the Lord finally said Yveltal are we happy ethically(all laugh) who said no cause what is ethical tickling isn’t defined thus the irritation(all burst into laughter) anyway,so these brats were doing these and then to Chu’s reply Ultranrcozma then was saying after all these thougts i thought truely those brats didn’t know the beau attacking types if they are mental(all burst into laughter) and that’s age realted so i thought how to use age realated attack(all burst into laughter) but by then neither Chu nor me knew what in the world 2nd brat wants(all laugh) so the master brat was summoned(all laugh) he said stay still and look after her so no plans materialized as Feraligator said to suddenly take the two idiots away from each other when they were bodyslamming(all burst into laughter) to which Crawdaunt pointed out that this should be distributed in combinations so that after first each bodyslam time decreases to get them roused most for the last for maximum damage(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter,.) which is the plan Feraligator says the the joy of the last is maximum to fix the next date or if no joy immeditaely reject why keep hanging(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter) to which Crawdaunt opined just as a backup combination(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) so i thought yeah bodyslam is to check the type of attacks that gives the mind more hunger for that moment again hard to get though so many attacks thus requirements this that too much demand should hold burgain with other attacks like beaus hence the illegality(all uncontrollbaly laugh) but these brats didn’t bodyslam except once Giti not much demand then(all burst into laughter) Giti said yeah don’t understand the difference between changing levels of longing in first and last date if manipulated properly(all uncontrollably laugh) creaturs(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) so this was going on as we were in emotional roller-coaster(all laugh) and Cili was crying more than Jane(all laugh) creatures(all laugh and .) anyway the jackal would’ve definitely been there to check on the proceedings(all laugh) and when Mist vomitted the first time would’ve jumped in saying this is preposterous(all burst into laughter) and most disgustingly would’ve asked me while i was tendering my flower as she was naively dosing in my arms(all laugh)..right(all laugh),that to know the reality i should actually observe the breathing pattern(all burst into laughter) and in Professor’s case i knew you were shoved the ideas down by brats who were lonely(all laugh) but mostly cause Muk failed to cajole him out as he thought i was going to patch up before to counter(all laugh) i knew it was a matter of Muking(all laugh) but just wished that that never took place cause i first day went there with my lackey bro(all laugh) and saw Lillie(all laugh) to whom i gave a rather scornful look(all laugh) i instantly realized that you all were as much as Mist is too me the whole family cause i saw my own mom in both of you that day the very first time i saw and i knew about the Professor Tyranitar inside out and the jackal too as longing to longing(all laugh) cause all i saw in the gym were my own sisters but that picture i lost somewhere after i became foolish so a confirmation like Mist and Mantine Expert Violet i spoke with 1000 times(all laugh) so i knew her very well and how she like Gengar has only 4 lines in her mind(all laugh) either too expressive or too caring(all laugh) and yeah i called during lunch not working snacks(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing and Violet .ly laughs) What is this life if independet women are too much cared(all laugh)/greatest husband expects the free expression thus during lunch breaks only fares(all laugh)/what is this battling cause sweet little beings also has invisible tears(all burst into laughter)/they are as much human as Mantine is to me thus i only ever keep the performance-chair(all laugh)
BUT(all laugh)...21 long years back my 1st badge happy that Onix granted us to be alive/but 15 long years later rocket was given a bribe(all laugh)/to do the obvious just to announce that family you must now strive(all laugh)/cause a solo means the singer projected her soul but cheered he must be naive(all burst into laughter,.,cheers for Brock,Violet also cheers for Brock laughing .ly who shakes his head laughing)..”
Brock(laugh) : “what brats are advising this brat(all laugh)..and to be honest that brat is jealous of me cause only i have a total family(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “what is this life if battles are fought/we can’t have enough time to give thoughts on every thought(all laugh)/what is this life if for the meanig we don’t care/thus i’ll be naive to all too caring i’ll ever fare(all laugh)...but Foster is such a great man(all laugh) i asked why a Diancie wasn’t profssionally handled(all laugh) said ‘um..no not like that but..(all burst into laughter)’ i said only the Azumarill behind appearing FiniRina(all burst into laughter and .),blushes(all laugh) i said atleast when i was here before and you both were calling at right times only(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) said,’um..yeah,just look at Steelix(all burst into laughter),so naive(all burst into laughter) then i asked the Florgesed Flores(all laugh) the volcano is a mountain of rock(all laugh) smokes no matter how Diancie know(all laugh)’ Flores laughed and said each time the Azumarill was around Magcargo forgot not to falmethrow(all burst into laughter) so i said yes still wouldn’t say FiniRina(all bursts into laughter,Brock laughs .ly) Flores herself was in tears with laughter said cause the calls will revert back to Mantine then to do the rest(all burst into laughter) just so naive all are(all burst into laughter,Brock .lu laughs)...so yeah,something is there Brock really in that city that makes people to follow you(all laugh) “
Brock(laugh) : “since this brat knows it ever asked me about Mantines(all laughter) naively(all laugh)..and Gary what about these pokediscussions(all laugh)”
Gary(laugh) : “all vulgarity would be removed if they hear these(all laugh) creatures(all laugh) and Magmortgolem says if you want to bodyslam the 2nd brat as Darkramar say why only personally at home professionally show that how good you two are to attract more beaus(all uncontrollably laugh)...i fled the scene immediately(all laugh) this brat has taught the not male difference exactly except his flower so now we get the utmost vulgarity(all laugh) really with these and with eloquence it will be so easy to be naive(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “and i’m told to be at present according to the proportion of longing(all burst into laughter) and by their master brat then at Johto i was told that why are you eavesdropping on telecommunication companies(all laugh) i said what do you mean,said i feel you’re getting interested in water gyms(all laugh) i was aghast(all laugh) how did that brat know cause Dase of all Daisyls(all burst into laughter,Daisy .ly laughs) wouldn’t tell her baby sis who is 7 years younger Gyarados that scoffs at her friend-husband in front of his mom calling her mom and him my Ash(all laugh) and as far as i knew the Ketchduck was too naively intellectual(all laugh) to understand anything except her own head-wrenching heart-ache(all laugh) so i also had this intuition that this man is like his hidden dumbfounding skills and absurd training methods of asking human questions to pokemons that got pokemons to evolve themselves without a meaningful match to the highest level in like 2 days(all laugh) catching strange brats like Snorlax(all laugh) and then rather than taming him giving him the batton to train his master(all burst into laughter) that got a brat like that propelled to utmost indecency(all laug) and then impossible mind games against hall of famers with psudeo-legends at regional league finals for 8 matches at the age of 19(all laugh) and not a single one got a clue what he was doing for these 8 matches throughout with so few pokemons and one psudeo legend(all laugh) and his pokemons never looks tired unless they have to attack much(all laugh) no really Ash i know you always told about not being good enough in your match against a former Ms Sanders(all laugh) what was there?”
Ash(laugh) : “my flower was namecalling her in last round rather than me(all laugh) no Melody told so many times that if Madgaleo came to me 4 months ago then he would’ve attacked the crowd as well(all laugh) Solgaleo was new and with his rage and longing for me(all laugh) lost head against a shrewd brat like Alakazam(alllaugh) and Alakazam’s medicine for psychics or others who aren’t born like Snorlax or Gengar(all laugh) is to make him more serious(all laugh) by seriously discussing about thoughts on planes(all laughs) so the brat gets lost in lecturing(all laugh) but Solgaleo is psychic Tyranitar(all laugh) so he wasn’t shrewd that day(all laugh) Tyranitar and he did play mind games later but in Unova(all laugh) just went there told me don’t dare to interfare we’ll fondle the human brat too(all laugh) after match asked the opponent who fainted if the performance was right(all laugh) and Yveltal by then cooled down much so asked are you unhappy(all laugh) actually i wanted to push Solgaleo in that situation to tell him that itoo long for his well being(All laugh) the brat afterwards was sad as each scoffed at him saying that brat was a pushover(all laugh) who went to pokecentre 5 seconds later(all laugh) but i get sad for Melody thinking of that match i had contacts for such a long time till she herself said would get married very soon and that was it for her in this profession unless may be much later she decides otherwise and i just wished her well that day hearing her voice i didn’t even say you’ve done enough to get two leagues for yourself cause it all soured so much so i just said that her bunch was good and all she even said that she barring the starter thought should hand them over but later said couldn’t just that was definitely for life atleast so it was difficult i just patted her saying no new beginning best wishes just for all all will be fine and that was it 3 years back and i’m unhappy cause she could win atleast two more if not all 6 and hall of fame and that is all among my professional contacts there has been such a few cases but this was most tragic then just best wishes i have and whenever her name is uttered i feel that pungence cause i guess she wanted a brother like person big bro or something like May but somehow neither her nor mine wavelenghts matched anyway that was the professional proper way personally you should tell only Magmorter and Golem while fondling him too much that water too is very good(all burst into laughter) then next moment chide them saying they lost track of that flying type(all laugh) no wonder they are spoiled(all laugh) CUNNINGLY(all laugh) anyway Trace what were your VIEWS on my WICKEDNESS(all laugh)...”
Tracey(laugh) : “well those mind games gave me the intuition that this brat is the most cunning fox(all laugh) cause i was asked about Misty flower by his own mom(all laugh) she said Mist is too sweet and simple but Ash won’t budge no matter his feelings till he knows every bit of Mist’s mind without trying to know(all burst into laughter) cause he ever told me his own mom knowing all that and told the same on being seriously grilled on his homecoming better friend after 14 days(all laugh) that is she you wife(all burst into laughter) said that no just likes our friendship too much as do i(all burst into laughter) but yeah if she is like this till she gets married her husband will be in safe hands(all burst into laughter) and said, she is my female best friend(all laugh) cause every other girl i met so far is a girl(all burst into laughter) i said the other way around volunteered to become totally blind since day 0(all laugh) and you saw her here same thing 4 years or so 24/7 togethger both can’t stay without being with the other(all laugh) and while on road Misty tells him to walk behind her(all burst into laughter) and these restrictions as i saw and now hear are ever increasing(all laugh) more than 2/3 minutes talking with another girl alone is an unforgivebale offense(all laugh) and our champ looking at anyone since 4 years has been saying isn’t that Mist(all laugh) i guess the wisdom has to come from an old grave gym leader(all laugh) but my intuition was that the brat is patiently waiting for the headache to burst then he’ll jump(all laugh) which in fact Gary ever helps in doing by 2 words(all laugh) in exchange of pokemons  like Crawdauntogator,Giraora or quotes(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) and i was ever called to first tell him about Marshadow,Snorlax,Banette and Buzzwole(all laugh) then all that Gary said i must repeat cause two different views if there is on same thing then Professor will be asked(all burst into laughter) and any confusion in his mind that we couldn’t clear or he thinks we’re not clear about Yveltal’s ACTUAL colour(all laugh) Professor is asked who if says you’re dead will strainght go to burial ground(all laugh) or govt office(all laugh) to check(all burst into laughter) then that brat says all these and i was stunned i said what do you mean,says,’i feel you know a lot of Dewgongs(all laugh) that brat since day one was too keen on the gym(all laugh) and as soon as i heard that i went there was interested to know my activites(all laugh) and because the other two he knew and all 3 of us personally and his wife-friend did the other way around in a loathing way(all laugh) which he compared to his stark relations with a Mr Oak Mr Oak(all laugh) and leading by naivety(all burst into laughter,Brock .ly laughs) so,i was then the obvious Daisyl(all burst into laughter) so i told why don’t you travel after getting engaged to your friend-girl-Misty AS A HUSBAND(all burst into laughter),’um..no just very good best friends(all burst into laughter) don’t be clever(all burst into laughter) but how good is my best friend’s eldest sister in gym battling NOT AGAINST YOU(all burst into laughter),i said mate why are you after me(all laugh) just marry your 19 year long Mist wife again today(all laugh) leave me alone GOOD BYE(all laugh)...’this confirms my intuition Trace(all burst into lauughter),bye(all laugh)’ i later thought thus the same that this brat was hurt by his Mist flower cause he turned the phone off and expected calls(all laugh) FROM THE EXACT NUMBER(all burst into laughter) so may be now realized that it’s not the wife at all and thus has become Madgaleo(all laugh)...then comes back and beheads me(all laugh) then sends it to my wife(all laugh) so that now he can trap her by means of me and i’m only being used as i was forced into a deal cause of many ghosts(all laugh) and if the Daisyl gets the ghosts i’ll have to be sentimental(all laugh) so using me he pesters my wife(all burst into laughter)..my wife isn’t it my wife(all laugh)...Ash Scyther(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “Oh jackal my jackal(all uncontrollably laugh,Daisy in tears laughing,Tracey uncontrollably laughs) thus protection is at sentimental circles only cause Scyther is HUMAN(all burst into laughter) and the jackal said that girl is cute yeah you mean Mist(all laugh) no that girl yeah just Mist(all laugh) Ash observe(all laugh) and extract the information without attachment(all burst into laughter) yeah like Mist looks still cute without being attached to cosmetics(all burst into laughter) so i knew it’s just human(all laugh),anyway that dance was great dance(all laugh) held each others hands in too proximity too sweetly(all laugh) and Mist lost her voice screeching so too more proximity(all laugh and .) so i was rather patting her saying always get so emotional(all laugh) to which she sweetly smirked(all burst into laughter)..yeah(all burst into laughter) and she said i’m her more than best more than friend 1000 times(all laugh) and i said we cherish our friendship so much(all burst into laughter) so on that day itself we confessed that we’re spouses for 19 years(all laugh) and thus the toffee-flower was at my home(all laugh) and then all the same whenever with me,Mist is just like a little baby(both smile at each other same pose) and then the human just afterwards fondled me to death and said that my bunch was so tough and could beat another 5 Dragonites(all laugh) but later in pokecentre said didn’t you push your opponent too much(all burst into laughter) NO IT’S INHUMAN(all laugh) the judge said has he been recently dumped(all burst into laughter,Tracey .ly laughs) so Trace why so naive(all laugh) i know the university though(all laugh)...”
Tracey(laugh) : “a veil to hide the foxing(all laugh) no i became more naive as i had to replace someone 22 years later (all laugh) and that absense too just like when the absence was here even Mr Oak is so happy now(all laugh) and i’m more a family friendly better man lesser(all laugh) and also i had to be the relatives(all laugh) so just the space(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) the thought that universally special IDEA(all laugh) it’s just so naive(all laugh and .,cheers for Naivety,all burst into laughter,Brock .ly laughs) so Orange league final comes and Ash chooses no sorts of ghosts(all laugh) cause he had only one but unfortunately i was there too(all laugh) and that brat was a psudeo-lened(all laugh) and the Opposition was Ash you bit(all laugh)”
Ash(smile) : “Mr Dillon Mystrom,Pokemon Master Hall of Fame,6 leagues,5-2,but later resigned due to health issues 3 years back i didn’t face him during my Elite4 had resigned 4 months back i called him and he was happy congratulated me and all his issue is very serious still among us but not in a good condition at all suddenly that was detected anyway 6th league that was 4 time champ already(all laugh)..after that Unova and finally Kalos won both and from Hoenn,Roseromsburg City Drew’s birthplace later they shifted to Martisburg,starter was Totodile(all laugh) anyway(all laugh) well the greatest boss had Corpish as starter(all laugh) then first league was Hoenn-not won,second Johto-won,3rd Kanto-won,4th Hoenn frontier-won,fifth Sinnoh-won,6th Orange-not won,7th Unova-won,8th Kalos-won,in Elite4 lost Unova and of course Kanto(all laugh),Johto was very first one for him in Elite4 and only may be i’m among very few who could choose own schedules and then me every single bit of it and they just had to budge cause i was the head of Sinnoh and by proxy Kanto and Kalos and Unova was earth to me(all laugh) and so on McShin(all laugh)...Jasu(all laugh)...that man is something(laugh) with him and Stu on top now and Persy being my lackie it’s just so funny(all laugh) the honoured ladies group doesn’t get involved(All laugh) and Mark doesn’t know which dragon should be for which gym(all laugh) but Unova is just 301st Cili(all laugh)..sweet sweet Cili,don’t you think two round firgues rather than one increasing by a round firgue with two in digits is preferable(all burst into laughter)..then Cili would say yeah own gym so play the double role now each day(all laugh),anyway,Trace..”
Tracey(smile) : “yeah the opposition was and that was his best opposition then for sure cause he said used all the psudeo-legends that he had against a 19 year old on his second league(all laugh)->
Yveltal(all laugh),Thundurus(all laugh and .),Spiritomb(all laugh),Volcanion(all laugh),Jirachi(all laugh),Marshadow(all laugh),Cresselia(all laugh),Lunala(all laugh),Latias(all laugh), and then finally Dragonite(all laugh)
what a line up that was and Ash only read about Spiritomb(all laugh)...so  Ash before going to platform says equal field no changes(all laugh) and before i could react his wife namecalls him saying why didn’t you do it since round 16(all laugh) to which the husband says don’t lose your voice because of emotions(all burst into laughter) to which the wife scoffs(all laugh) and yeah cause the husband said she first thing had to do was to lose her voice in 4th round(all laugh) then i was thinking that they’re finally 19(all laugh) so surely no matter the result they would get married won’t they(all laugh) anyway 19 year old teenager against 4 time champ in 5th league goes with this lineup unchanged(all laugh)
Metagross(all laugh) that was his best psychic along with Celebi and Marshadow the only three psudeo-legends and went first cause Yveltal is Yveltal(all laugh) no more unhappy sorry happy(all laugh),Chu(all laugh),Pangoro(all laugh),Emboar(all laugh),Meowstic(all laugh),Whimsicott(all laugh),Charizard(all laugh),Celebi(all laugh),Marshadow(all laugh) and finally to finish Muk(all laugh)...
now first Yveltal vs Metagross draw both goes down,Thundurus vs Chu 1st match(all laugh) and Chu astonishingly wins(all laugh) and what a match that was itself Thundurus did use thunder-chair even then(all laugh) but that was countered with self heal and extreme agility and irontail and most of all mind games(all laugh),in comes Spiritomb beats Chu in about 10 seconds(all laugh) comes Pangoro,wins(all laugh) don’t know how that match even took place between two totally different brat(all laugh) none of Spiritomb’s tricks worked despite a dark fight type(all laugh) that brat just fooled around Spiritomb got him flustered cause the fight ensured Pangoro lasts long then just a punch(all laugh) Ash’s only ever trick with ghosts each time works(all laugh) no matter who psychics and ghosts and dragons and darks can’t beat him if he’s on the game barring that Johto after that totally different stuff and that day too as not he but Melody said just Madgaleo(all laugh) came two months late made it up during Unova(all laugh),comes in Volcanion(all laugh) and wins then strangely goes Emboar(all laugh) loses eventually(all laugh) so the crowd says 19 years too much ego thought the draw and Spiritomb means already got it(all laugh) BUT the plan works of getting Volcanion over the confident(all laugh) Ash said fire is irritating water is cool mid is confidence(all laugh) where the brat knows to stay till death(all laugh) feed fire so water side roused so more confident cause knows that the fire was not shown aginst a electric or ground so confident again so feed him a psychic gets over the confidence swings too much and to get back to confidence gets too self centered loses(all laugh,.) cause next in Meowstic(all laugh) who gets under Volcanion flustered and beats the hell out(all laugh) now comes Jirachi(all laugh) and Meowstic still wins(all laugh) but is absolutely knackered and the crowd says great match but petulant(all laugh) still doesn’t change boys these days too much ego too much show-off(all laugh) and the wife namecalls everyone(all laugh) and the trouble is now lost her voice so unless i convey(all laugh) i’ll get beheaded(all laugh) now goes in Marshadow(all laugh) then the time was right to change(all laugh) but still Meowstic who badly loses(all laugh) goes Whimsicott(all laugh) loses(all laugh) so all were saying that’s it(all laugh) now my hairs were no more(all laugh) and i scoff at the Gyarados sister saying this is public place you’re humiliating us almost bites my ears(all laugh) namecalls me and with no voice says my Ash..um..(all laugh)..Ash will still win and if he doesn’t i’ll kill you(all laugh) then again namecalls Ash(all laugh) so i was trying to say that then get married(all laugh) but desisted cause i needed to be alive(all laugh) so now strangely goes Charizard(all laugh)-this time a date(all laugh) and astonishingly beats Mrashadow of all peudeo-legend ghosts with pace and power and his own fool around nature(all laugh) and so comes in of all Cresselia(all laugh) and Charizard goes down with her(all laugh) so now it’s 3 on 3 and comes Lunala(all laugh) and goes Celebi(all laugh) but can’t win now finally goes Marshadow(all laugh) and somehow fetches Lunala off comes in of all Latias(all laugh) and Marshadow is absolutely knackered surely Ash can change and that’s the thing to do cause Latias is Latias(all laugh) Ash doesn’t change all say done ego kills talent(all laugh) Marshadow tries can’t goes down so Latias is there Ash is down to last now finally comes our Muk(all laugh) astonishingly Muks Latias(all laugh) nothing happened with the psychics cause due to the dark powers of Muk though he can’t hallucinate still is resistant the more Latias want to finally be serious the more obviously Muk fools around(all laugh) and finally beats Latias of all psudeo-legends(all laugh) now the final and most surprizingly Muk is absolutely fresh cause he rather enjoyed Latias(all laugh) and then Dillon is a bit surprized to to see that(all laugh) Ash absolutely no emotions and Muk tries to Muk Ash(all laugh) whole place including Dillion is stunned(all laugh) as Ash lets him get Muked(all laugh) then comes Dragonite(all laugh) Muk goes in and after 25 minutes(all laugh) Dragonite finally tries the dragon blast slam as last resort cause Muk too is so tired(all laugh) now Muk seems to be happy at this(all laugh) and Ash finally smiles(all laugh) and gives the instruction that is unforgettable tells Muk Professor(all burst into laughter) first none ever heard of that attack before(all laugh) second even if they have(all laugh) they don’t know what exactly is coming cause Muk gets so happy(all laugh) third after first gym none utters the attack verbally and this is a regional league final(all laugh) fourth even if this is code laguage people think this is some sort of attack and they will eventually see the attack but none tells their pokemon to not attack at regional league final from atart to end(all laugh) you know Ash’s matches none has any clue what is happening(all laugh) just very few attacks all to defend or just when opponent can’t help but do something(all laugh) just so naive(all laugh) and still,all knows you can’t use code laguage with pokemons else may get yourself killed(all laugh) and then fifth Muk was independent not like now but he had his leeways was just waiting for the direction later was dicussing then was bossing then not at all listening(all laugh) now totally independent each brat is(all laugh)..and that was playing to own pokemons nature only doing exactly the opposite to the first line in pokemon handling not to let them fondle you too much to get them tamed(all laugh) thus showing the brat himself was one(all laugh) and i saw how Marshadow was tamed at my cost(all laugh) do you understand why he wants this but hesitating(all burst into laughter) i was aghast why would he tell a psudeo-legend ghost with such power and all to read human emotions(all laugh) and Marshadow tried couldn’t was angry exactly what the brat targetted said now do you understand that you want to hit him but can’t why(all burst into laughter) thus that brat realized he likes his master and yeah the obvious(all laugh) really man 19 years he has been after me too much(all laugh)..anyway, then Muk was at plane grass nothing was there and just before Dragonites fries Muk,Muk using his arms lifts himself which is never seen or heard before(all laugh) cause only once in ever one has that ability of fooling around naturally in front of sure death(all laugh) and Muk thus swings away(all laugh) and Dragonite gets into the ground and Muk Muks Dragonite that was swing away fool around tease and trap best friends(all laugh and .) so Dillon of all people gets baffled(all laugh) and that was the end cause of full blast poisonsault and Dragonite already was frustrated just was it whole stadium is ashtonished as Dragonite is out cold and Muk is jovially laughing(all laugh) referee after 10 laughed himself and Dillion the same and the wife finally wifes up and tries to hold traditions(all laugh) when we go there and the better friend confessions go on later(all laugh) and so on but that was something with Muk(all laugh) later that day asked the pest what if you face this said i don’t tell them to attack Trace cause i attack they don’t(all laugh) ever a draw isn’t it can’t defeat friendship by the same being degree independent can you anytime in 3 days or 3000 can you Trace(all laugh) and i was absolutely sure that i’m going nowhere from Oak Lab this life cause a pest like this and a Muk only like this isn’t found everyday who doesn’t want to battle by battling all time MENTALLY IN QUESTIONS(all laugh) so just the dishonestly honest hallucination to tame to unleash honestly dishonest hallucination to befriend to again dishonestly honest hallucination to make the grounds even(all laugh) so i realized this pest is something of that type(all laugh) and that was some match(all laugh)..and yeah i never saw 19 year old 19 year long married couple either(all laugh) which is..”
All in Unison(laugh) : “toffee-flower(all burst into laughter)”
Misty(frown,same pose,Ash bursts into laughter,same pose) : “SHUT UP(all burst into laughter)! Only my hubby nicknames me(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “toffee-flower(all laugh)..right(all laugh)...no Muk is Muk you know as is the Lugia(all laugh) and then i gave the replica to Professor no doubt(all laugh)..that was some match and then Mr Slate(all laugh) but before that how was Trace received by Mr Oak Mr Oak..”

Gary(laugh) : “no this pest has ruined my life,my wife,my family,my son- my,my,my what a pleasure(all burst into laughter)..”

Gary(laugh) : “no Misty shouldn’t have saved you rather should’ve drowned there(all laugh)..”

Daisy(laugh) : “well you can go along here as well(all laugh)..and Trace(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “and me too then but my loin will be the last(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “yeah,none knows so too much glee(all laugh)...this brat eavesdropped us(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well i can list down really the earliest age(all laugh)..11-12,10 crushes,12-13,10 crushes,13-14,7 crushes 14-15 that feeling of 4(all laugh) then last year special school realized i wasn’t in the herd only(all burst into laughter)..so total 31 crushes(all laugh) and none knows(all laugh) well may be suspicion(all laugh) but to veil that they were told about bad stomachs(all burst into laughter)..and i do know cause i know the ulterior(all laugh) really then realized the 999 ways of handshakes(all laugh) and all sorts of signals cause they were in my feelings(all laugh) these none knows outside all thought too much density but was the exact opposite(all laugh) that was the VEIL(all laugh) i told these to my Mist flower whoose school days i know more than her of course having visited saloons unfotunately(all laugh) handshake wasn’t all the time but that thought and observation that FEELING(all laugh) and you understand what it means if that continued cause Kalos i was since like 10(all laugh) my sweet flower hears these next day to confession(all laugh) and she was too Gyaradosey to realize anything at school(all laugh) and later too(all laugh) first region didn’t have any clue of anything second region all has cause of that age(all laugh) exactly why i was holding her hands more than i wanted(all laugh) cause i like her so much(all laugh)...anyway(all burst into laughter),then Johto she understood things but so sweet and simple but Gyaradosy(all laugh) and hence wasn’t allowed to anywhere without me or Brock(all laugh)..and Brock was strenly chided to be incensed if anyone came near my flower(all laugh) that is if talks fine but shakehands(all laugh),cause Brock is easily made to be naive(all laugh)..then after confession i tell these saying i need to be frank with you but all were before i knew you hence i’m saying now(all laugh) she just hugged me too dangerously and said,’um..sweetie do i look nice today(all burst into laughter)’..i said only you are the epitome of ugliness to me since first sight(all laugh)..then too happy,’um..Ash..it’s ok you..(all laugh)..’,i realized my sweet Gyarados was fed too intellectual food cause her own experiences were so dreadful so i said,hence you’re not a girl at all what i wanted is to get out of this mess of gender only then went out to journey(all laugh) else another year would’ve been taken first day class still remember Squirtle starter this this attack this this life and so on i was thinking man i want to be Squirtle to know him but what would he add to my life(all burst into laughter) and then one year the struggle went on the herd had to go and went fortunately cause i wanted to be a pokemon so so desperately(all laugh) and had hard time really cause i was born on 1st January not 31st December so it had to be the case that at 2nd January my flower is only a day younger to me(all laugh) and then that is so sweet but what wasn’t was that at my normal school finish time was 15,June of course and thus from 15,January to June last school semester and special scholl together(All laugh) hence failed in two subjects(all laugh) then Mamoswine supplimentary exams(all laugh) then passed those getting just pass marks(all laugh) then pokemon school finished and just get the hell out of home(all laugh) and Mr Oak’s normal school finished at 15,December so Mr Oak got a full year of freedom to be typesetting on pokemons(all laugh) and i loathed it(all laugh) anyway,then went out met Mist no feelings at all then understood she was so sweet and that stuff was the stuff cause by then the psychophysicality went off(all laugh) and hence things became more clear and that quote i told Gary says was my anger really by then i realized difference won’t perish unless the thoughts do in the thought of the thought as at the ages the issues i faced(all laugh)..and they weren’t going at all till Squirtle lessons came around(all laugh) one year blood and sweat enough and hence read those stuffs as well(all laugh) then not so much but just my notes and all kept secret and so on(all laugh) later the books came around and was with my bunch forgot everything they were everything to me and then i’ve had my family or member till my 6th journey and then just Cili(all laugh) and undercover still had my family as you see(all laugh) and Kalos(all laugh) by then i was eloquent intuitively cause i was 32 and with the dreadfull undercover experience with break-up and then the preceeding 22 years(all laugh)..exactly why that Kalos brat was sweared to death otherwise not to that extent it would’ve and bro vs beau was as well i was just laughing off at the press and all then i lived at a different sphere really with my bunch so much intelligent and the whole system really me and my buddies nothing had any values really but then again my Mist called me and i was full for good but would you believe me Gary that Noivern is independent of me cause he really is(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “your wife had given the answer twice in a day once to rocket once to Trace(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “anyway,then really took 4 years to digest things and then the special school was it cause i wanted to be them minus the herd(all laugh)..really they teach me all time you know(all laugh)..that feeling(all laugh)...later was well Brock or Trace said that girl looks cute first thought yes,next blood and sweat(all laugh) much later actually realized in Kalos that is that blood and sweat must be applied on own self first(all laugh) hence i say i’m far brutal on myself cause without that blood and sweat will mean disdain for everyone including not not males(all laugh) but then it wasn’t that case(all laugh) hence strict professionality hence my pungent feeling that i didn’t do enough for Melody and that’s why in these days so many people want to fondle me cause 1 year of blood and sweat on myself with my previous habit has come off some age now(all laugh)..anyway then first the natural feeling,second blood and sweat then next the difference(all laugh) so was incensed(all laugh) and difference was there cause blood and sweat meant the polish of gender went but the idea of gender remained(all laugh) so incense(all laugh) then started to find where it ceases thus fourth was Mist and i said yeah just Mist(all laugh) cause that point the difference ceased(all laugh)and no my flower has gone through the most brutal scrutiny during 4 years(all laugh) but then that was natural cause we were 16(all laugh) later the things came around and all then by the time of that picture just didn’t know what was hindering me from happiness even at Gengar plane(all laugh) anyway,then after difference ceased that just Mist my emotions calmed down cause Mist took those away(all laugh) and then instantly i got the real person that i was seeing(all laugh) but still as i said i ever thought i must maintain 10 ft circle thus professionality(all laugh) really getting married at 16 was crucial for me(all laugh) and this sweet Gyarados would’ve created a mayhem if didn’t find me(all laugh) and then well 10ft circle meant i had nothing to do with their personal lives and then only one Susan as you know was left as friend the rest two fled the scene with too much battling those three were same never felt that much difference hence friends but strict professional and the reasons are they are too well know too Harris and Kane and Mr Oak Mr Oak hence among mutual friends so rater known people,unknown people or where i had to make friends thunder-chair(all laugh) and here well my sis came in Hoenn and she was 5 years younger to me bust first same reactions went through me but then as you know i ever say all of you are in that relation of soul to me May really became my sis and me her bro in those 20 minutes and Max the same later only the age difference is a bit barrier but same as you know but then there was SPEW(all laugh)..that brat was pestered to death really that too with Madgaleo of all brats(all laugh) Drew is just my bro as well a sort of shrew(all laugh) man those 7 questions were something(all laugh) anyway,all these taught me that unmarried female brats are extremely dangerous(all laugh) that specis is harder to detect cause of that VEIL(all laugh) so they get the job done in silence(all laugh) thus i could detect all sorts of damn brats cause i was all of them gender independent(all laugh)..um..Mr Oak Mr Oak do you smell the being in plural(all burst into laughter)..
Gary(laugh) : “yeah,indeed all do(all laugh)..that brat stayed with you two months and picked it up(all augh) and that brat bugs around exactly for that(all laugh)..i tell you THIS BRAT PLAYS THAT MADDENING TUNE(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “Magmortgolem(all laugh)...anyway,then Brock saw Viol flower at 19 and she the same thus that FEELING(all laugh) cause no reason for the two to keep contact for 14 succeeding long years that too by phone(all laugh) and Violet wasn’t even a gym leader officially(all laugh) just fiiled in sometimes cause her Mantine was too good(all laugh) till recalled(all laugh) really i was way worse than all really in that feeling(all laugh) but the trouble was i was searching for the one who is the one that is the one as this one appearing as me as the one(all laugh) hence those stuffs went off as fivolusly as they came(all laugh) cause i didn’t even want to talk to them cause this feeling never went that why the difference won’t perish(all laugh) and hence the trouble(all laugh) and hence the anger then before i met my Mist and later when she became Misty(all laugh) in that phase she being me the difference in that way did perish except the natural of course(all laugh) in that feeling(all laugh) then in-between in was 31 to 35(all laugh) so thunder-chair was inbuilt and assimilated to the current extent(all laugh) and then came the eloquence(all laugh) that was really it as now i i could talk whole day like i’m now(all laugh) in that feeling(all laugh) no never can forget that boys and men Ash the difference you can’t simulate,just that FEELING(all laugh) man that was something(all laugh) then i was so so lucky that i was found by my Mist 1st day otherwise i would’ve chided away any girl(all laugh) really i have had crushes when needed to talk all got abstruse stuffs(all laugh) cause once had to come out of observation hardly a trouble cause the difference perishes(all laugh) so that was my trouble why would genders exist and the difference won’t perish thus i’ve had to find answer to my current extent as much has been possible for me to do and then nourish do you know anyone who wants to cherish(all laugh) that brat Zekrom first day almost gave up the breeding power and was absolute lunatic in starvation period(all laugh) then that self came around cause she’s too happy now(all laugh) thus she cherishes us so much(all laugh)..what a brat that is anyway,then Doctor Slate was Brock Slate then(all laugh) anyway he comes in 2 weeks before first then stayed a week then took a break of 5/6 days in Gradlivion City then again was here so the Professionally balanced observation is,hmm...gym leader..hmm..one on one..hmm..(all laugh)...rock type and Cerulian..hmm...(all laugh)..3 city circular...hmm...(all laugh)...Gradlivion beau..hmm..(all laugh)..poison type...hmm..(all laugh)..Nidoking...hmm..(all laugh)...electric to water to rock to electric mitigate it so poisonous..hmm..(all laugh)..roamed around with Ashey-boy cause of Cerulian..hmm...(all laugh)..too Gyaradosy and travel companion so information..hmm...(all laugh)...in return brainwashed Ashey-boy to be naive which takes 3 years so now comes checks in teaching to be fetching..hmm..(all laugh)..roams around too Naive shows as if doesn’t know anything canny in breeding but still wants to roam around one flower means other flowers and fitted in..hmm...(all laugh)...Cerulian gym main leader wants to sell badges another too wigged but..um..anyway(all laugh)..thus they still stay around thus another doesn’t..hmm...(all laugh)..first tried to burgain with with family water connection the flowers were too tough didn’t help so now one is out and has volunteered into surrender and thus showing the naivety against expression leading around..hmm..(all burst into laughter)..one is out so now the infoes are needed and sentiments are to be fed of generousity and longing so roaming around..hmm..(all laugh)...now a new import is here as well who is similarly wicked so the duo will watch over..hmm..(all laugh)...base supply and front leading..hmm..(all burst into laughter)..hmm Ashey-boy hmm..one to watch over the base proceeding including my bunch(all laugh) while checking on the Cerulian proccedings and this sample is also here Orange certainly fond of water now 1 year infos and pictures so hmm...(all laugh)..hmm Ashey-boy hmm..double edging...hmm...(all laugh)...hmm..Ashey-boy..hmm..first the opposite type leader who is naive so will budge to water types thus looking to mitigate it with poison long distance not suitable didn’t advance thus now oversweating hmm...(all burst into laughter)...Ashey-boy gets two lackies to make inroads in the Cerulian..hmm..(all laugh)..hmm..Ashey-boy...hmm..dealing around..hmm...(all burst into laughter)..fed a brat to grandpa now this sample too infatuated thus gradpa won’t say anything with his activities and thus i’ll get the chop if i try to complain cause gentleman-fox..hmm..(all laugh)..and gym leader roams around with Ashey-boy for infoes and in return will get the Gyarados to become more blind..hmm..(all laugh)..hm..Ashey-boy..hmm...trophy,Orange,honeymoon,flower,buttler and then ride(all burst into laughter)..hmm...(all laugh)...and each has eyes on Cerulian thickening..hmm...(all burst into laughter)...and the new import is opposite to the main leader,the absentee is opposite to naivety(all laugh) and Ashey-boy wins trophy and Gyaradosy flower cause she is totally blind..hmm..(all laugh) all three similar samples Ashey-boy leads trophy and flower..toffee-flower..hmm..(all laugh)..hmm..toffee-flower...hmm..(all laugh)..fitting around..hmm...(all laugh)...and fed grandpa a replica so grandpa is a total pet now(all laugh) so will boss around here and the gym..hmm..Ashey-boy..hmm..toffee-flower..hmm(all laugh)...3 booked another is anyway(all laugh)...hmm..Ashey-boy..hmm...gym mastery..hmm(all laugh) and confidents have fed the in-law family to watch over so pokemon mastery..hmm...(all laugh)..’..so this is one part(all laugh) then the next is just a damn brat and the opinion is not that type(all laugh) so that is alright and then Violet would be..hmm..swinging around..hmm...(all laugh)..but at Viridian..hmm..(all laugh)..one is naive another even more expression and naivety but that type..hmm..(all laugh)..then this is one then Trace(all laugh)...hmm..pokemon ovserver..hmm..goes in in a gym to look around..hmm...(all burst into laughter)...and a few sketches of a few days..hmm...(all laugh)..observes pokemons unattached to them so experienced in neutral observation...hmmm..(all laugh)..thus observes a brat over for 5 years..hmm..(all laugh)..in-between feeds sketches to strenghten the second cousin mask..hmm..(all laugh)..the brat will get suspicious and the target will get more trust will come back here to sketch the actual skecth..hmm..(all laugh)..thus psychothrombonosising around..hmm...(all burst into laughter)...hmm..Tracey-lad..hmm...personal observation..hmm...(all laugh)..then still waits to get to the finish line cause will observe the path hmm...(all laugh)...second cousin..hmm..(all laugh)..university and everywhere roams around to find the right bush then to slowly observe the prey then Skechit down..hmm...(all burst into laughter)..Ashey-boy gets the main hindrence under control..hmm...(all laugh)..the target sentimentally chides everyone to hide around..hmm..(all laugh)..Desyiling the Daisy..hmm...(all burst into laughter)...1st one just that age..hmm..(all laugh) then next 2 pawns fed to sketches while the labour gets that looking around..hmm...(all burst into laughter)..the two doesn’t go to reservation in seclusion cause both are observing the other around the corners..hmm..(all burst into laughter)..then observing over Ashey-boy..hmm..(all laugh) again sketches the worng sketch thus one says why another politely says no it’s not right the target chides the labour as usual(all burst into laughter) the labour finally thinks the time is right to get out of bushes..hmm..(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs,Tracey laughs shaking his head) cause the target if loses this round of sketching after 3/4 years may not let him to continue around..hmm...(all burst into laughter)..observes for 13 years shows as if labouring around by not taking around cause the cause and observer both were looking around..hmm...(all burst into laughter)...pokemon observer..hmm..(all burst into laughter)...persisting around the looks..hmm..(all laugh)..but finally the payment wasn’t enough so increase that by revolting around..hmm...(all burst into laughter)...hmm..Shiftree..hmm...(all laugh)...then the target thinks may be too much so apologizing around..hmm...(all laugh)..the apology is charging Rhyhorn so calmly observes around..hmm...(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs)...then the target is very dissapointed cause she thinks even at this age still labour will burgain around..hmm...(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..then labour was waiting around..hmm...(all laugh)..gets the target at absolute loss as the last pawn against Ashey-boy now will again try to jump Salamences but later try to become Gengar and force the soulmate to do the same if that doesn’t work then will complain to the main Gengar..hmm...(all burst into laughter)..and record the meeting..hmm..(all burst into laughter)..saying that Gyarados was trying to make them call the main Gengar from her own phone to tell him that your Gyarados is being fed materials to chew around so that she prolongs that longing..hmm..(all laugh)...starving..hmm..(all laugh)...anyway(all burst into laughter)..then the labour sees that the target now can’t keep the Daisyl mask at all that everything has become dark so the prey is set and jackal preys tiring the prey down no matter how big so now finally jumps out of the bush..hmm..(all uncontrollbaly laugh,Daisy in tears laughing and has fits and convulsions of laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..and the years were laid down as the jackal herd of sly ideas in wickedness were being played now the real jackal jumps on with the erected years..hmm..(all uncontrollably laughs,tears and fits of laughter,Daisy has convulsions from laughter and tears laughing,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..so finally showing the erected years asks..’these were laid down despite the behaviour why sorry still(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter,Daisy in fits and tears of laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..hmm..(all uncontrollably laugh)..this was to get the best look around..hmm...(all uncontrollably laugh)..erecting the years..hmm...(all burst into laughter)..then the target suddenly understands the lightyears were passed with the light that will get this darkness off so forgets to close the door..hmm..(all uncontrollbaly laugh,Daisy tears and fits of laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..of all people Sarah was waiting around as the two flowers were packed of to right places while one was permanently at bay with a playboy not of that type..hmm..(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) so no hope this one was left finally the years do the trick looks into the bush observes picture sketches in mind combines the ideas understands the happy reality that the packing is right and shuts the case –

Ash(smile) : “Mrs Patricia Hoffman,6 leagues,but didn’t enter the Elite4 competitions at all went off to retirement just after that final and now of course no more in the profession neither is her husband who was out of profession to begin with now much older i guess i was 22 she was 42 then 20 years older so now 56 and out of profession for 15 years now i was curious and so knew and completely family reasons just didn’t want it and all and i still spoke to her by sources when i got to Johto Elite4 and she said no just that very match itself gave me the idea that my career is done and just that match confirmed my intuition cause she had rather lost interest i guess or something else said that day tried her best to see if that door still was open for her in terms of interest but wasn’t so went off and then straight went off just family reasons her daughter was 12 then now 26 around Dawn’s age an year or two younger may be she too not in profession as her dad is in engineering not related to us anyway,Mrs Patricia Hoffman,started at 16 huge career of 26 years and if wished to complete would’ve been 28 and is from Jaumstack City,Johto,starter,Azurill(all laugh) because she was human got Azumarill(all laugh) and you saw i guess the other few matches too(all laugh) of her that how great a pokemon an Azumarill is but yeah(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) and a known Marill of ours doesn’t know what is psychic(all burst into laughter) anyway,it’s just inhuman on Marill man just namecalled infight(all laugh) though mind the psychothormbonosis Trace,that’s possible with a Metapod(all laugh) surely(all laugh)..i can never forget that Metapod vs Metapod(all laugh) but that Metapod’s 3rd class(all laugh) is so truely so..so then first region,Johto-not win,second Kanto-win,third Orange-win,4th Kalos-win,5th Unova-win,6th Sinnoh-win,7th Johto battle frontier-win,8th Hoenn-didn’t win so the first and the last didn’t win middle all including Kalos at 4th and Unova at 5th though from Johto,you realize how great she really is and how self established she was at young age going to Kalos at 4th region winning it then Unova and win that though no more in profession and surely must’ve been in Hall of fame if continued so yeah all my finals were against great great people but despite me in the very last(all laugh) that was ridiculus(all laugh) cause it was age related tickling(all laugh) anyway that’s my bit and this time we know what my wife-flower did(all laugh)...right(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “ yeah right(all laugh),so yeah during Hoenn final Ash was too confident(all laugh) and i was a bit stunned(all laugh) and anyway Patricia goes with a lineup of all times(all laugh),
Goodra -count 0(all laugh),Kyurem(all laugh)- if i were(all laugh),Solgaleo(all laugh)- no happiness if born(all laugh),Heatran(all laugh),Zeraora(all laugh) – Mr Oak Mr Oak(all laugh),Darkrai(all laugh)- in between(all laugh),Zekrom(all laugh),Reshiram(all laugh) – where am i(all laugh),Hoopa(all laugh) – the meaning(all laugh),Garchomp(all laugh) - relection only(all laugh)
then Ash goes with the obvious(all laugh)->
Tyranitar(all laugh),Jellicent(all laugh),Glalie(all laugh),Metagross(all laugh),Emboar(all laugh),Crawdaunt(all laugh),Luxray(all laugh),Musharna(all laugh),Solgaleo(all laugh),Snorlax(all laugh)
first draw,second Kyurem(all laugh),third Glalie,foruth Solgaleo(all laugh),fifth Solgaleo(all laugh),sixth Emboar,seventh Heatran,eighth Crawdaunt(all laugh),ninth Crawdaunt(all laugh) that was some round against Zeraora of all eletric types(all laugh) Ash said electric means too egotistical(all laugh) so feed him that get him too more egotistical by racing him and giving him leeway(all laugh) and against dark then water you can’t win a race(all laugh),tenth Darkrai,eleventh draw,twelveth draw(all laugh) now Ash had two and whole world knew Solgaleo will come(all laugh) and thus comes Reshiram(all laugh) and comes of course Solgaelo(all laugh) and it’s a draw(all laugh) so now Ash has no psudeo-legends left cause Marshadow and Celebi were fried during both quarters and semis(all laugh) and still has to topple 2 possible psudeo-legends(all laugh),comes Hoopa(all laugh) and goes our Snorlax(all laugh) direct type disadvantage once more and Hoopa totally befooled with Snorlax’s attitude just like Muk(all laugh) none knows how despite having no tricks what-so-ever and strategies and all being most ordinary first he finds these pests that are in-born brats(all laugh) and then gives them the leeway not training them at all but letting them train him(all laugh) and i saw him during 2nd year at Kanto got philsoposhy and psychology questions and materials in piles(all laugh) asking me and Professor and said for training(all burst into laughter) i was aghast as to is he sane(all laugh) wife said my Ash..um..(all laugh) Ash is so sweet um..no no(all laugh) um..clever but not intellectual(all laugh)..um..but clever..(all burst into laughter).. then the husband asked strange questions to Charizard of all do you know what is the diffrence between flamethow and the desire(all burst into laughter) both didn’t know what they were doing and where they were(all laugh) and was minimal training with the customery fights with our bunch but too much(all laugh) but even then while doing so whole time was questioning or training but no matter what he was doing his wife namedcalled him(all laugh) during questions wife would hear them and would scoff at him saying tell your bunch to understand them as codes you jerk(all laugh) which she herself tried with her bunch who were each moment told to understand what they were told to do and why(all laugh) the what was her own question(all burst into laughter) and why was why my Ash always counters i’ll show him(all laugh) this the husband opined as reverse training seeing the things herself first then the battle is fought before the actual..very sweet..um..emotionally steady at right places(all burst into laughter) and i asked that Misty disturbs you during training all time(all laugh) so..,’no Brock it’s help actually(all laugh) she knows me and the anyway(all laugh) she namecalls me(all laugh) but that disturbance means i have to be even more concentrated and my buddies must understand different emotions YET get the questions if in an exam hall all the surrounding is disturbing you won’t you still forget it if the question makes you think would’nt you Brock(all burst into laughter) i want to be like them exactly and then they may try to be me exactly may be rest is useless isn’t it(all burst into laughter)’ well ultimately it was proved that they were thinking the same so both sides became absolute brats(all laugh) then i asked the Gyarados if she understands that she disturbs her husband during training profusely cries(all laugh)..’shut up!..how can you say i don’t like my Ash..um..my friend Ash(all laugh)..Ash..(all laugh)’..goes to him and then they were 17(all laugh),says Ash don’t you like me(all laugh) husband says yeah i like our friendship very much best friends but what if a Kingler vs a Steelix(all laugh)..so then both get engaged(all laugh) and the rest is forgotten(all laugh) even then during last few days hands were held yeah the eavesdropping(all laugh) but hugging only after permission did the husband do but that was my permisson(all burst into laughter) i told him during Orange phonecalls when Trace used to say are they engaged since childhood like family agreement(all burst into laughter) so i told Ash you were holding your Mist flower’s hands even at Kanto while she barely desisted from attacking you(all laugh)’,’yeah,emotional a little she is around her best friend(all laugh),anyway,Hawlucha vs Crobat..(all laugh)’,so then after in Kanto husband consoles wife that she doesn’t disturb at all it’s just the longing(all laugh) so then later Misty says huh,my Ash..um..(all laugh)..Ash said i’m his best friend(all laugh) in your face you namecalled Brock(all laugh) he said it’s ok like an exam hall and i want to get prepared before facing questions he wants the opposite(all burst into laughter) so he observes my training while reading philosophical questions(all burst into laughter) cause the disturbance during preparation isn’t nice and i namecall him cause more disturbance more mental questions like he’s my..um..friend..(all laugh),’boy yeah(all laugh)’..’um..shut up!i’ll never get mingled with such stupid jerks(all laugh)..my Ash..um..(all laugh)..just shut up(all laugh)..’,so after these chats i realized these two little pests don’t understand anything at all except their in-bron impossible talents and intuitional capasity and same amount of feelings for each other(all laugh) and i had to protect them from the sludges both outside and own mental ones and i myself was 22 during certain breaks(all laugh) but that nature of Misty got her to where she is in non Kommo-O scale(all laugh) and in it just the word is Jelliogredos(all laugh) no Misty if tries to be like this pest she won’t be able to stop laughing herself at all before fainting as i found out to my utmost horror in Viridian lake where the married again 35th couple hostaged me(all laugh) and this pest scared me to death with his Giratina(all laugh) and his protection that day was land department Ultranercozma and Giratina(all laugh),sky department Latios and Hydreigon(all laugh) and even the land water was Palkia with Kyurem(all laugh) and from Viridian to Viridan Lake Forest went on Hydreigon(all laugh) while Misty was alone there she had Palkia,Kyurem,Ultranercozma and Latios with her(all laugh) and her whole water knowledge was questioned as to why she doesn’t handle all types cause all elements are same(all laugh) and then was grilled to answer her human type advantages(all laugh) then her knowledge of all kinds were reviewed by the circular logician with another in-born brat questioning her in the end if she knew her surnames before being born(all burst into laughter) Misty almost died from laughter while she was alone and then this pest hostages me and makes her laugh even more wasn’t sane the next day(all laugh) and i after surprizes and all had returned home at 20 and this brat abducts me at 21(all laugh) and yet sends me home cause Viol was out for married men in forest suspicious(all burst into laughter) and this exact thing Viol was told(all burst into laughter) my only fault was that i said you two are perfect for each other during our lunch at the farm there at noon which is the trouble(all burst into laughter) and these 6 dragonic pests then and later scared the whole forest cause none are found anywhere here naturally and these brats can’t breed as well to our greatest relief(all laugh) and where they are found they are extremely dreaded creatures(all laugh) but these are not from anywhere of course as we know(all laugh) and his flower that day didn’t have any pokemons,husband said just enjoy your time on my lap(all laugh) and what pests were looking after her(all laugh) and he cooked that day in the meantime and already had a bit of snacks and then forced me to dine and again informed Viol that the food i didn’t eat was suspiciously kept intact(all burst into laughter)..i understood the density save us then(all laugh)...anyway then Hoenn again sees another utmost brat as Snorlax fools around with the ghost so happily(all laugh) and the happier Hoopa gets Snorlax gets even more happy(all laugh) and if Hoopa gets serious the same(all laugh) atleast Hoopa loses patience comes hyper beam(all laugh) and dark barriers don’t work Hoopa is done(all laugh) and done now comes Garchomp(all laugh) direct advantage but Snorlax is special(all laugh) so goes in and Snorlax was absolutely more fresh playing with Hoopa and so happy(all laugh) so still his own patience ever infinity and more comes good can’t hallucinate that brat ever(all laugh) and neither can you go anywhere near him or get hugged(all laugh) Garchomp tried the flamethrow trick with agility the brat straight went in water(all laugh) and was swimming around(all laugh) then Garchomp got the water out but at the same time received a dangerous hyper beam(all laugh) then was back to agility fire which was received by lying down in the water spot and just moving out(all laugh) and the more rest Snorlax got more chance of a more dangerous hyper beam and that patience meant agility was out cause he detected the whole picture(all laugh) and each hyper beam was more friendly as if to compete in fake fighting(all laugh) and himself was fooling around and no matter which side he went Snorlax just lied lullued against the water spot being inside(all laugh) finally the dragon was frustrated so had to get close and got hugged(all laugh) and so Garchomp was done(all laugh) with 10 hyper beams and Hoopa took 2(all laugh) and Snorlax wins totally fooling around for 30 minutes in 2 rounds(all laugh) and Ash gets the second league then told us Snorlax was saved to lull the challenger to waste a fighting or ghost type(all laugh) and Garchomp just equal Snorlax was better(all laugh) cause of his in-born nature nothing more a fluke(all laugh) and then our sis finally fully understands that this brat is too extremely cunning in battles(all laugh) but her rose disdainfully said infinitely more so out of it which was wholeheartedly agreed by Tony boy(all laugh) but our sis said just sour grapes(all burst into laughter) this made her rose absolutely loath her big bro(all laugh) and Tony boy understood his flower needs protection else this pest may try to test her to maxima and she doesn’t know anything except her forever husband(all laugh) and huband did jump his wife later(all laugh) but most dangerously he was eloquent then in anatomy(all laugh) anyway during Hoenn final he looked so confident cause Tyrangaleo would’ve surely taken two down(all burst into laughter) so it was 8 on 8(all laugh) and after match was extremely confident and we saw that was too happy(all laugh) because he was going to finally propose his 24 year married 24 year old wife Mist better friend(all laugh) which he later said if she shows that veil again(all laugh) then he’ll play(all laugh) with two words otherwise still would’ve played(all laugh) to get everything just so naive(all laugh) but the words would’ve been different then(all laugh)..what are the plans(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “i always would’ve rejected her first to get the cosmetics off(all laugh) i just would’ve used one word(all burst into laughter) which Mr Oak confirmed 2 years back(all laugh,Gary laughs .ly) Mr Oak Mr Oak what are your Magmortgolem doing..(all burst into laughter)..”
Gary(laugh) : “totally spoiled both almost not(all laugh) scoffed at me saying not to professionally or personally disturb them if i think that with this sort of word don’t professionally or personally disturb our thinking process as professionally personal moles(all uncontrollbaly laugh) cause now that you think you’re happy cause you’re with your 2nd brat Lil(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laugh) should we too be dance to your tunes(all uncontrollably laugh,tears)...two most headless brats say these(all laugh)..this is encroachment of area(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “impersonally(all laugh) Mist would’ve either said how could you(all laugh) or i hate you(all laugh) or that’s it which she said(all laugh) all three is 1st as is not needed according to the Professor the smaller the better is the emotion cause said no words just the ring(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) then 2nd same 3rd same(all laugh) then just say rest same just soulmate and that would’ve been at my room(all burst into laughter) so barely a matter of another word(all laugh) just atmost a SIGNAL(all laugh,Ash and Misty smile at each other same pose) so anyway then finally side-show(all laugh) and what an opponent(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “yeah about this one the whole world knows everything(all laugh),Mr Stuart McShin(all laugh),current Elite4 head Kanto from Vermilion of all Giovannis(all laugh),7 leagues,6-1,still can’t get over both the second being 6-4(all laugh) the age realted relations aren’t mentioned(all laugh) so anyway goes with and here you can’t use Psudeo-legends only Knato or Orange if from there all Kanto if psudeo-legend then can’t be used unless the numbers are short(all laugh) but then opponent can use any dragon(all laugh) and yeah McShin’s career we all know just the flow(all laugh), 1st Kanto-win, 2nd  Orange-win, 3rd Johto-win, 4th Hoenn-win,5th Sinnoh-win,6th Unova-win,7th Kalos-win finally of all 8th Kanto Frontier sideshow couldn’t win(all laugh) goes in this with,
Bleziken(all laugh),Unown(all laugh),Gulark(all laugh),Alakazam’s Melody(all laugh)...”
Mist(agitated,same pose,Ash bursts into laughter laughing and hugs Misty quickly then same pose) : “SHUT UP!(all burst into laughter) that namecalled crook always brings that up(all burst into laughter) Ash they are after me(all burst into laughter)..shut up you namecalls(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh,same pose,Misty too in same pose) : “cause you’re all our sweet little Mist flower(all smile)..right(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “then next at 4 was Gyarados(all laugh and .),Mismagius(all laugh),Bisharp(all laugh),Shedninja(all laugh),Celebi(all laugh),Raichu(all laugh) this has to be direct type battle only one so Ash goes with->
Emboar(all laugh),Gardevoir(all laugh),Trevenant(all laugh),Reuniclas(all laugh),Weavile cause(all laugh) you can use ice as that was mega red dark dragon(all laugh) then dark must be so that and then cause of dark type in darkness of reason behind the difference is Bisharp(all laugh),Togedemaru(all laugh),Buzzwole(all laugh),Meowstic(all laugh),Luxray(all laugh)
and the result was Emboar,Gardevoir,Gulark,Reuniclas,Weavile(all laugh)-never lost to Gyarados before or after no matter what got under the skin(all laugh and .) well to each actually(all laugh) except for Kanto never none no matter who or which pokemon got upto him or his bunch always the opposite(all laugh),Bisharp meant McShin was in real trouble(all laugh),Togedemaru this meant match will go in extra round 3 time limit of 5 each(all laugh) if only all rest 4 were won by McShin in given time(all laugh),Buzzwole(all laugh)-this got the brat to absolutely loath it cause first Buzzwole was against Shedninja a ghost(all laugh) and yet won cause he is an in-born brat as usual(all laugh) and second it meant Ash wins direct sets(all laugh),then Meowstic this meant the papers will magnify it for next few years being 8-2 humiliation of 7 time champ to a 2(all laugh),finally Luxray(all laugh) means Stuart McShin 7 time champ on side show formality wins 1 out of 10 rounds against a 2 time champ on his 5th journey(all laugh) and Gulark too didn’t have it easy(all laugh) despite being steel against Trevenant’s grass type cause Trevenant was asked do you understand the hard life of emotions(all burst into laughter) so almost got Gulark but was a bit too heavy Gulark just about won(all laugh) and a mega red big evoluted Gyarados of all can’t beat a Weavile(all laugh) got under the skin despite both being dark and Weavile was fresher than whan he started after 22 minutes(all laugh),Ash said AH!DRAGONS!DRAGONS!(all laugh)..and that match took 4 hours(all laugh) so McShin was even more incensed(all laugh)..and finally the trophy has been eternalized till the man himself is alive in this term as his name has been spared to honour his whole dynasty as McShin cup(all laugh) the dynasty temselves like it so much(all burst into laughter) and for last 6 years they live in Viridian(all brust into laughter) and Ash despite his mastery over dragons never had a dragon till Unova of all places and then what chosen brats have come(all laugh) cause they don’t understand what a dragon is and how it evolves in ethical honesty of reflections of strak Mr Oak differences with Mr Oak as they cherish all so much(all laugh) utmost brats these are and the master brat just showed what he can do with psychics and ghosts and darks and fairys and electrics and fires(all laugh) and steel and bug and fight and ice as well(all laugh) and just how good he is against dragons(all laugh) no wonder has 17 total but they aren’t dragons as they ask for our opinions on age realted thoughts(all laugh)...just grass and water was left despite Crawdaunt and Feraligator and Sharpedo(all laugh) first since Sharpedo never lost one water cup(all laugh) in Johto Sharpedo wasn’t taken was kept at Cerulian(all laugh) and was last at Orange and Hoenn onwards gym or cup that brat alone would definitely get two(all laugh) cause Sharpedo of all pokemons were thoughtfull with this pest(all laugh) cause he said being at a gym made her realize she is in an environment where all the weaker ones are more well rounded to beat her so she became a master pester herself with the dark mixed to get her to incessant patience and fool around thoughtful level(all laugh) and water was ultimate test(all laugh) and that was it really cause there’s none like Crawdauntogator(all laugh) and one step above ultimate was Bayleaf to get the grass sentiment settled by revolting agisnt mass hunger(all laugh) who did it all by herself first and then in a fire gym of all and still was against a most maddest Dispoptas(all laugh) and that really was it rock none would ask would they(all laugh) atleast Mr Oak Mr Oak knows all about it and now has his very own chosen Golem himself(all laugh) and rock type was the one that made way for more than ultimate the eloquence in both the master brat and his soulmates the pokebrats(all laugh) and of course the last left was legends(all laugh) that too has been done(all laugh) and yeah poison Professor(all laugh) normal Snorlax(all laugh) did i forget gounded Goodra and Solgaleo well we must stay on ground(all laugh) and flying is just the pursuit of happiness(all laugh) and yes Charizard and Lugia too(all laugh) and then we know Lugia’s type too as is that of another dragon Latios(all laugh) and for the man the eloquence as well(all laugh) so you know Ash is retired and should be by all means(all laugh and reciprocate)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well all cause of that day when i was born just a luck and my bunch and all of you and outside and then on the first day of journey was found by my bug(all laugh)...anyway(all laugh),what now i must say cause you won’t that how was my match against Melody(all laugh) the first Kanto last 16 i was a brat then(all laugh) and no really my bunch is born like they are that’s only 50% the rest 49% is that Mr Oak Mr Oak and Muk Skechit are who they are in the professional circuits and as is Doctor Slate in feelings as well(all laugh) hence the sponsors are manipulated(all laugh) and they are nothing without the engines that are their soulmates and the viseversa too surely none can tolerate moody brat frivolities like Daisy does all the time(all laugh) and none except Lillie can jump into the ocean to fondle a Cylster for no reason(all laugh) and surely no Mantine is more knowledgeable  about themselves than Violet(all laugh) really you all came much later here but the way you fondle them has got the brats to utmost lunatic audacity as they have their ways all time(all laugh) and Professor is Professor as usual my contribution is only 1% that is to find them and serve them to you by setting them upon you(all laugh) rest i stay away for years so content with everything(all laugh) and then the whole lab as well Lenny for sure(all laugh) but in Johto i was overconfident with 2 psudeo-legends and all and my flower got me down by hugging me(all laugh) LITERALLY(all burst into laughter)...yeah(all burst into laughter),so i was distracted by my longing for her from my overconfidence(all laugh) cause that overconfidence went to my flower that she really was not a girl and best friend girl not girl looks only so(all laugh) thus wife(all laugh) and i never had the word like her cause that would’ve been disturbing as i said(all laugh) and i ever thought why i should actually say anything(all laugh) thus two words(all laugh) but that vulture killing oath(all laugh) but before vulture killer Mist atleast said i cherish you 500 times(all laugh) and i only said i’ll namecall you unless you say you’re my best friend(all laugh)..right(all laugh),i went to maxima saying you cherish me cause of your own self satisfaction not cause of me that’s selfishness of highest kind(all laugh) was blind almost crying cause my Ash doesn’t understand me despite seeing me almost die in his own arms cause that’s where i’m when i’m dozing(all laugh) and my Ash via his bunch knows exactly what my nerves are doing at each moment even in sleep cause 10 ghosts were there(all laugh) and later psychics were added in herds as well(all laugh) Banette,Mismaguis,Aegislash,Bronzong,Gardevoir,Deoxys,Uxie,Musharna,Meowstic,Reuniclas,Unown,Beeheeyem(all laugh) total 22 psychics were looking after her states in most crucial time and Bulbasaur was there Bayleaf as assistant and Abomasnow was there still had Jellicent and Noivern and Charizard around and then during proposal she was held at a place cause she was very week and i didn’t hug her before the vultre killer finished in full taking 1 hour(all laugh) was hed by Crawdauntogator(all burst into laughter) they were fed the idea that they will get girlfriend(all burst into laughter) and they were doing most boring job so was incensed later(all laugh) and then Mist was sleep powdered cause that emotion only one’s own wife can take cause that’s exactly what her husband wanted(all laugh) no matter the formal relation in dozing period(all laugh) so i tendered her head and all and told my brats to be carefull to which they said a matter of meaningfull tickling(all burst into laughter) should we help(all laugh) so i realize what a way to die if we both do so(all laugh) anyway,in Johto semifinal that match was,Melody’s selection was 10 psychics(all laugh)
Uxie,Mewostic,Metagross,Beeheeyem,Sableye,Magearna,Unown,Gengar,Reuniclas,Alakazam now i have each brat except the last brat(all laugh) she emptied the tank that day on psychics(all laugh) and i had
Marshadow,Beeheeyem,Tyranitar(all laugh),Unown,Pangoro,Celebi,Banette,Metagross,Whimsicott,Solgaleo(all laugh)
first draw,second draw,third Tyranitar(all laugh),fourth Tyranitar(all laugh),fifth Tyranitar(all laugh),sixth draw(all laugh),seventh Unown,eighth draw,ninth Gengar,tenth draw,eleventh draw,twelveth Alakazam,13th  Alakazam and Melody was the winner(all laugh) she used to ask why am i after her on psychics of all pokemons(all laugh) i said you ever trained those each of your fire types are also psychics(all laugh) and thus you were all over them only to release 10 on 2nd league semis(all laugh) said well the Unown vs Unown went well(all laugh) and said i thought that was the only way to beat you cause you have strange pokemons like Muk(all laugh) and i said yeah just by luck they arrived(all laugh) and she ever had that one type too many(all laugh) and asked me why Whimsciott couldn’t beat Alakazam cause my plans were perfectly suitable for Whimsicott i said no Alakazam stunned us with the fighting type spirit that was hidden really so went the distance and then Solgaleo was Solgaleo(all laugh) and she went to Kalos and quarters she reached but yeah 3 years and that extra yer got upto her too bad and she agreed with me later said yeah should’ve covered Hoenn first but just thought that Kalos was possible may be get it done first and Unova was kinda challenging myself but she was ok after coming still but then those brats jumped up to her foolishness and frivolity and all the more that that name you know we all know and i recall cause i’ve seen so many battled so many she definitely had the 8 win potential and that was lost still a two time champ still huge name in Safforn and Melody really has remained an enigma and still people remember her for that incredible talent and skills at that young age with psychic types of all and then with such jovial and nice personality to handle tat type at that age so easily and then the such strange career the high and within 5 goes into another profession our profession and her contributions to trainers budding gym leaders and all kinds of people associeted with psychic types and all after she settled down in Safforn has been huge i myself got massive helps before Undercover on basic things though i myself by then was much more established enough to have all those behin me like that once ever bunch after Unova before undercover but still the ideas were great and that’s the thing with psychics if ego nothing works and that’s why even more such discussions are needed and people needed to be respected and they are great people and each type infact the board psychic chain is that and all 5+ champs know that Sabrina and Melody there were huge and Sabrina herself says a really sad case but anyway i’m again so happy that has moved on and is happy with her 2 kids in Levender long way away surely her kids if come here will get right guidence and will finish that career so just best wishes(all smile) but Sabrina has been after me(all laugh) says why don’t you come here take up the gym and just a role exchange(all laugh) i said well how can you manage water gyms without water psychics says real hallucinations(all laugh)...anyway,your words Gary on that day on soulmates(all laugh) to me meant you and Lillie can’t forget each other cause you were soulmates meaning no matter the word which is called girlfriend(all laugh) she only is your wife(all burst into laughter,both Gary and Lillie laugh shaking their heads)...so shrew was given that knowledge two years later(all laugh) and now day after final is Tony boy who now is in Kanto VIA Cerulian(all laugh) AND knows all about me and my flower(all laugh) cause that damn crook(all laugh) said yeah Ash knows well about electric types cause girlfriend is water type gym leader can’t beat her otherwise(all laugh) in front of me(all laugh) cause i said no when i went to Cerulian i only had 3 and my Chu wasn’t properly tamed was rather lucky to get the badge and this(all laugh) now Tony boy himself wanted to jump in water gyms(all laugh) asks yeah Misty(all laugh) that damn crook(all laugh) suddenly smiles but NAIVELY(all burst into laughter,Brock .ly laughs) that was it Tony boy says all possibilites of of future(all laugh) i said mate if you go there and say this to a gym leader you’ll be jailed(all laugh) and i’ll lose my friend Brock is just overzealous cause we are good friends and he likes both of us no more(all laugh) but that obviously my flower was made maive(all laugh) and the reason was that since Mist came here always pointed to me as my Ash to all and i was longing for her AS a friendly Gyradaos(all laugh),so Tony boy is asked,’a blink a touch a smell a sound same food may not be so tasty/10 years 20 years or a month things do get nasty/moving around roaming around so many things to see/umpteenth time on same rose next time where’s the bee(all burst into laughter,.)...yeah prepared them(all laugh)..Tony boy says,’all cognition if by itself directed to the single/changes only being compelled if the single no more single(all laugh)/like you may know a few things that where i stayed is single(all laugh)/ among which there’s one never knows what’s mingle(all laugh and .)...so this means Tony boy is Cili fan(all laugh)..Cili 301st calls receive give me Kommo-O(all laugh) on the night of the post marriage assurance discourse(all laugh) Brock informs all and Cili calls too excited was fed Misty Fletch(all laugh) then fianlly ‘mam gets him to understand that it’s only her(all laugh) then finally just after ‘mam said good night and he was so overjoyed to speak with ‘mam and then that too as my wife finally(all laugh) just said thanks and before anything else i say that before he cuts as good night tone i in this tone say KOMMO-O(all burst into laughter)..Ash don’t disturb ‘mam and cut this language(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) so(laugh,all laugh) KOMMO-O(all laugh),so you see i’ve been accused of preferring pokemons and my bunch and else are accused of spoiling everything(all laugh) this happens to all but me most funnily as mom still believes Sableye prepared the two words(all burst into laughter) and Gengar knows her and dad’s confession moments line by words(all laugh)..GENGLEYE(all laugh),anyway,then we come to Kanto and i say 2 words(all laugh) and then this phase is about negotiations(all laugh) so i ask the rose,’Drew,i saw my Mist 8 long years back/then 5 years 24/7 even at my home(all laugh) never was any crack/2 years just a call no matter didn’t know exactly what each other doing/still is same as was ever sure that you won’t be rueing?(all laugh and .)” now the poor shrew can’t poem(all laugh) gets angry,’Ash you’re getting under my skin now(all laugh)..what is..’,’do you trust her?(all laugh)’,’enough’,’just?(all laugh and .)’,’yeah yeah now married so wants to send us to jail(all burst into laughter) i’m not leaving my soul..um..(all laugh)..’,’sweet rose(all laugh) right continue.(all laugh)..’,’yeah you said it yourself(all laugh) stop pestering me and sometimes fly back to the gym with all those brats yours(all laugh) and yeah send roses there NAMING YOURSELF(all burst into laughter)’...so i knew the shrew was MAD(all burst into laughter and .) for now(all burst into laughter,.) good then 6 months later they almost confirmed(all laugh) so i finally tell shrew,’persistence for 3 to get the 3 is the word get right/if the same effort put again a chance someone else might(all laugh)/too much focus on one in childhood of a teen(all laugh)/in both sides aren’t there many more dreams in dream(all burst into laughter)’...this is a double edged sword(all laugh) means another 3 with fect 9(all laugh) which is behind the back(all laugh) then the word GET(all laugh) means you were hanging around like a so and so and finally trapped the so and so(all laugh) then too much focus at young age means any little sentiment and breaks and the dreams will change(all laugh) and finally the last line is pure naturality(all laugh) which i’m cautioning them against(all laugh) shrew doesn’t get any of it(all laugh) says gravely,’i’m seeing you for 3 years now what’s your trouble man(all laugh)?first you said 2 words(all laugh) then streamrolled away the next day(all laugh) and now after us(all laugh) and you say seeing someone yeah just Mist(all laugh) i’m as much..um..(all laugh)..’ so that was done then i tell him that,’you’re still teenagers think hard i took a long time to be sure no matter what my girlfriend did or thought and so telling you and also my sis and you’ll grow up many things will happen and thus if not outside the internal demons will be running through you people(all laugh) so just calculate and strategize well that’s all don’t lose real matches and here neither you nor she will be able to help each other rather the opposite(all laugh) so kid CAUTION(all laugh)..’,’yeah yeah i get that,wisdom(all laugh)..married so no trouble and now teaching us(all laugh)..’,’Drew now Tony will leave won’t you be like LONELY(all laugh)..’,’yeah like Misty was for 2 years yeah(all laugh)..Ash why do you think you’re a speciality..’,’among especiality(all laugh) yeah go on(all laugh)..’,’yeah your suspicion whether materializes or not you’ll come to know if only i travel with you which i would’ve had YOU not been there(all laugh)..yeah yeah you’ll say family schism(all burst into laughter)...’,’but you can feel sweetly(all laugh) to be lonely so are you sure that you want to cherish my sis(all burst into laughter)’,’i already do and ever done and ever will and..’,’will want to confess to her(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah i will BEFORE 8 YEARS(all laugh)’,’professionally jealous(all laugh)’,’that she can be too i mean..(all laugh)’,’too aching(all burst into laughter) anyway..’,’Ash i tell you clearly and frankly that i’m never..’,’have been the type to get jealous of trifle matters like roses that comes if you win a trophy not by yourself but by the bond that you have with beings called pokemons and the bond unless of honesty those results can’t be fetched IN PLURAL ONLY(all burst into laughter) thus i being a trainer know that pokemons don’t catch certain EMOTIONS(all laugh)..’,’yeah like deceit(all laugh) you’ll be sent the ring first to consecrate that for me(all burst into laughter) don’t bother AND the divorce proposal too(all burst into laughter)..Ash what is..’,’I WANT TO MARRY MY GIRLFRIEND(all burst into laughter)’..that day was something you know(all laugh)...’yeah yeah COMMITMENT(all laugh) then just know that as much commitment as Misty has for you and..’,’much more definitely(all laugh) no Drew you see for girls i understand but for me(all burst into laughter)...’,’Ash what is your problem exactly with me then you will say that any married couple for 30 years the husband is ulterior(all laugh)’,’i don’t like divorces you see(all laugh)’,’yeah i cherish May and will marry her WHEN TIME COMES(all laugh) and will confess to her PROPERLY(all laugh) but just you also will agree that it is ever a mutual agreement not singular’,’can you stay single if she rejects you(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah i understand INFATUATION(all laugh),and that’s why today no battle was imagined(all laugh) cause you are liking my plight SO MUCH(all laugh)...you’ll be asked for consent before times(all burst into laughter),GOOD BYE(all laugh)..’...this was face to face on cofffee(all laugh) then i later called the brat and said you forgot to eat the snacks(all laugh)...but i realized that he was as true as Mist was with me and that was enough and my sis doesn’t understand what is rejection(all laugh) then a little bit about the great rose,the rose before meeting May was minutely learning how to irritate girls so that they themselves will reject him(all laugh) and irritating them was calling them ‘mam(all laugh) then telling them to be a mrs they need to woman up(all burst into laughter) and telling his own female friends that see those biased brats and their infatuation(all laugh) tell your beaus to behave properly(all laugh) and the male friends were told that they should directly sweet talk and give a false ring(all laugh) if they were slapped(all laugh) that means no good(all laugh) and the pests were told ‘um your mrs’ (all laugh) then how his imaginary mrs was so much better(all laugh) and that was exactly the thing directly gave a rose(all laugh) and showed the exact characters of a pest(laugh) while telling her how should girls not be infatuated cause of politeness(all burst into laughter) and my sis was that exactly if someone despite whatever he says shows a character that really means he doesn’t care about any formality and wants to say directly that he wants her to be his wife on first sight(all laugh) then that is good enough to be put through bias(all laugh) so bias comes and Drew absolutely to the point tells her his own views while saying in between the same things pests say(all laugh) and that made them really done on 14/15 dates(all laugh) while at competitions and conferences or jungles(all laugh) maximum 30 minutes(all laugh) or inter round breaks(all laugh) only 3 or 4 times went to a resturantt for and hour or so for detailed bias(all laugh) and May prepared for that(all burst into laughter) i was told to call her twice in one hour(all burst into laughter) silently both time just message(all burst into laughter) that was that and rest was jealousy and fooling around to test the resolve(all laugh) the previous took all total about 9 next 18(all laugh) so in 30/31 months they were done in Battle frontier they were negotiating settlement issues(all laugh) for 9 months(all laugh) so i travelled with my sis for 46 months and they were done in 40 atmost i said you’re not legal age(all laugh) said huh you married your flower at 16,DREW WAITED TILL 20 AND 1(all burst into laughter) i said how old are you(all laugh),’i see too Mistyc (all laugh),I’M 20 THIS MONTH(all burst into laughter) AND DREW IS MUCH MORE MATURED THAN YOU’RE NOW(all laugh) YOU BEING SUCH CHISLDISH MISTY WAS AFRAID(all burst into laughter) AND THUS FORCED YOU TO MARRY HER ON FIRST SIGHT EVEN WITHOUT PROPOSAL(all burst into laughter)’ i said on first sight she slapped me(all burst into laughter) now this story is first heard by May(all laugh) cause the big sister told i said ‘thank you ‘mam(all laugh) and she said it’s alright don’t worry i am so happy that you’re ok and so on...(all laugh) then later i borrowed the bike and then the rest’ that exact word was the reason for slapping(all laugh) cause i should’ve said sweetie(all laugh) as during hellrounds i said Misty then later forced me to say Mist then i say Mist is namecalled(all laugh) so dejected that i had to sleep powder her(all laugh) then kept hugging her(all laugh) then again went back in position(all laugh) this was in my tented room(all laugh) then she wakes up i say eat these it’s been like 4 hours since you came(all laugh),’i won’t eat till you feed me by yourself(all laugh) and say Mist and sweetie(all laugh)’ then i too happily budged for the second time(all laugh) first time she was much in discomfort ate by herself and was light snacks and all for her dosage but second was medicine cause that dosage was nothing to her longing(all smile,Ash and Misty smiles at each other in same pose)...so now my sis hears this and was very suspicious(all laugh) i said she was like that too temperamental ever with me to show me how much she cherished me cause she was 16 and too impatient(all laugh) cause in her mind whole world was againt her(all laugh) and she has been madly yearning for me since that moment itself(all laugh) and to other travel companions cause you yourself being 10 years younger chide Brock(all laugh)..even in future Brock cause it’s just so naive(all laugh,Brock .ly laughs shaking his head)..Trace has same personality of a jackal(all laugh) ever our big bros as fox(all burst into laughter)...but Dad..um..isn’t he so..um..sweet sweet(all laugh)...no mom he’s just a friend..best friend..very best..um..good freind(all laugh)...right(all laugh), see mom,dad it’s not that that it’s a big issue at her age(all burst into laughter)...yeah(all laugh) yeah just call at dusk(all burst into laughter) mom says balanced spouse dad will be less naive(all uncontrallbly laugh)...”
Misty(same pose,smile) : “Gyarados says see and cough(all burst into laughter)...and(all laugh) moist the tiffin...(all laugh,all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh,same pose) : “young flower dream(all burst into laughter)...right(all laugh)..”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “trasport cosmentics...(all laugh,all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “um..Brock is it that she thinks i’m among her bunch(all burst into laughter,.)...right(all laugh),so Mist also acted the same with them like a angry little sis cause she was a mere kid then(all laugh) later became a gym leader now totally different is outside character but if you tell her that i spoke with a girl for half an hour you’ll see(all laugh) so she says,’i see Brock ever says marriage at first sight(all laugh) pretty true then that she had to babysit you first (all burst into laughter)..but um..should i slap Drew(all burst into laughter)..’ i said definitely like Snorlax vs Pangoro in 4th minute 7 seconds 5 hyper beams down (all burst into laughter) now the last time Drew was gruelled was after this cause i thought with these two they may create a mayhem(all laugh) and Drew was roaming around alone(all laugh) longing(all laugh) so even more so(all laugh) so then after that i knew 6 more months will be too late(all laugh) so i halve it down to 3(all laugh) so then i see the brat too much longing(all laugh) the i say of coffee(all laugh),’3 and half years longing so longing/oh my sweet rose to you belonging i belonging/and i see you inside me and out in dream/dreams are there cause of reality(all burst into laughter) the cake without a cream(all burst into laughter and .)...’ now shrew realizes that i’m at less darkness again(all laugh) so says,’still can’t get over the fact that in the whole world only you can be NOT infatuated(all laugh) why cause you kept your wife waiting for 8 years before telling her the eventual(all laugh)..Ash what is..’,’vomit(all burst into laughter and .) see in all these years there’s been times when my sis hasn’t been healthy was unwell and all and you know of her food habits(all laugh) so 3/4 times if not more she vomitted and wasn’t well then and except that as well and needed to be cared like a little sis she herslef was wanting her family beside her then and me and Brock did what we could and the biggest thing is that she has had her family all the time till now beside her cause Max may be way younger but you know for his age has ever been extremely self established and intelligent so he rather helped and now you know he himself will be starting his journey only here cause a few months left here doesn’t want to leave now and my point is exactly that you have seen the glamour or beauty(all laugh) or skill or words or heart or soul and so on you know all about my sis EXCEPT when she’s not healthy that’s still in your guesses only and about the professional jelousy(all laugh) no Drew i know about that it comes i didn’t feel happy i was jealous sometimes when my Mist beat me ages ago in few competition finals and i was a teenager like you then and her as well so my point is that this is from my own experiences that the vomit(all laugh) that’s a part of the smile and skill and the warmth and all else just remember that just(all burst into laughter) the rest will take care of themselves and you know exactly as much as i do what fetches you a trophy or a better bond with your family in your bunch’s term and what jealousy does to that and that’s for you and your reciprocation will invoke the same in her hopefully and keeping this point in mind why do you cherish my sis(all burst into laughter)?’,’yeah i see two years waiting cause whenever Misty was unwell jumped in(all burst into laughter) too much care so too caring(all laugh) and of course she being she definitely RECIPROCATED(all laugh) and to test that your 2 graet years(all laugh) and while teenagers whinned to her if won that all for her so that may get CLOSURE(all burst into laughter) and if she won played the sportsman to SHOW THE WAY TO THE CLOUSURE NOT BY YOURSELF LIKE 2 WORDS DID(all burst into laughter) that will be taken care of and thanks for vomitting on professionality(all burst into laughter) and yeah i know all that and those aren’t any hindrences to my longing and yearning and um..(all laugh) i just cherish my May so much for not any reason i just..’,’lose it in her presence(all burst into laughter)...’,’yeah as if 5 years only Misty did you were the great preacher of vomitting(all burst into laughter)...when she vomits i’ll clear it BY MY OWN HANDS(all uncontrollably laugh)AND WILL SEND YOU THE PICTURES(all uncontrollably laugh,tears)...’,’whoose is May?’(all burst into laughter)...’yeah himself says all the time my Mist and she says my Ash FOR 9 YEARS IN FRONT OF HIS MOM(all burst into laughter) but as soon as i said my May so again comes the GREAT INFATUATION DETECTOR(all burst into laughter)...i meant it really i’m not a..’,’dishonest person Drew i know that bit more than well enough now just congratulations to myslef(all burst into laughter)..but Absol vs Solgaleo 3rd minute 32 second 2 zap blitz down(all burst into laughter)..’,’yeah yeah enough honesty means eat battle forget last match repeat(all laugh)..’,’not the vomit(all burst into laughter) when you go for formalities(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter and .)’ this will make anyone fell off the seat(all laugh) so did the great shrew(all laugh) thank God it was IN PRIVACY(all burst into laughter)...i laughed hard and got the brat up who was dumbfounded(all laugh) and then realized it smiled and hugged me i said surely you’re not infatuated but very very honest to yourself i know for ages just pushing the envelop(all laugh) cause you can understand May is my own sis as much as that means to me and will be wanting to go with you so it’s better that atleast me and Brock know that she isn’t making a mistake nothing else sorry if i pushed too much and so on then he said no once i confirm i’ll tell my parents and she will tell hers as well and it’s all right we’ll go as a couple only in travels i don’t want hazards to float around and all(all laugh) and had a chat about a few things i was happy cause the shrew really was Drew(all laugh) so i was happy but then May heard the slapstick(all laugh) story 4 months back and after the total 7 questions and all(all laugh) finally she tells this story to Drew(all laugh) right after he loses to her(all burst into laughter) that was final hurdle that 3 months after virtual confirmation(all laugh) what if we change minds(all laugh) Drew was extremely angry(all laugh) and more so cause he was too much yearning for my sis and was being tested(all laugh) and before match she trash talked him(all laugh) so after match we go and Drew took me aside and said for permission that i said(all laugh) and the vomit(all burst into laughter) isn’t that ribbon 20th (all burst into laughter) i said,’well it’s ribbon taken up(all burst into laughter)’..this got the him to be dumbfounded(all laugh) and so in reply he couldn’t SPEW(all uncontrollbaly laugh)..so i said,’she has a serious problem Drew,Mrs Maple told me three days back secret,she has a disease and you know how much battle-reddened she has become so recently is going overboard and Mrs Maple got suspicious then told me it’s called Frenosiziongia which generally appears at early youth and it creats over enthusiasm and stuffs like that then conginitive difficulties,memory loss or many more things and so on it gradually grasps the whole mind,you can understand her parent’s position and i’m just aghast and hence said she’s taken up by that devil so..(all burst into laughter)..this was now mental test(all laugh) and he was 20(all burst into laughter) he became so dejected(all laugh) almost cried(all laugh) then said like,’Ash..i’m just..i don’t know..my sweet May in that..(all laugh)..’,i said,yeah,man hence saying you saw her behaviour even today(all laugh) it’s a concern i’ll now seal her totally upto the finals and then..(all laugh)’..he said,’um..Ash,it’s alright,but..’,’yeah hence saying man i’m only thinking of you since then(all burst into laughter)..but you know it’s just that no matter what she will forget you and then..(all laugh)..’,’NO(all laugh)..um..sorry,sorry..(all laugh)’, then i hugged him(all burst into laughter),’Drew,it’s not the time for emotions,hum?(all brust into laughter),you know me it could’ve been said by other means but my character is like this(all burst into laughter) i can’t keep it cause you atleast must know no matter what uncle and aunt say(all burst into laughter)..’,now the brat had tears(all laugh) said,’um..Ash,i’ll cherish my May no matter what,she’s my..i can’t be..’,so was sobbing now(all burst into laughter),now i patted him and then said lets sit there cause the next move is he will break my nose(all laugh) cause now if this wasn’t enough i’ll jump to the last step that fire line cause i remember i had my ideas clear on the posterity issue of ideal family(all laugh) so created a safe distance and Bayleaf was there as well(all burst into laughter) so then i said,’yeah such is fate man,ever so cruel,such a great family,so so sweet my sweet little sis and then(all laugh)..’,now the brat said,’no,Ash,it’s alright i don’t care,i’m not leaving her anyway..(all laugh)’,’yeah,it’s ok man,but you know i know you for so long as well thus you know you still aren’t in a way say more involved with her thus saying cause once you’re really in a committed relationship it’s so hard to retract cause like this there’s no trouble at all in it except cruel fate and you know it’s just the next steps beyond relationships Drew,this hell will hinder my sweet sis severely there as well,hence saying nothing else..(all laugh)’..and he was 20(all laugh) is extremely dejected as usual(all laugh),’um..Ash,it’s ok,you really are her and my big bro too(all burst into laughter)..it’s ok man,i don’t want to think about that now but atleast till she is ok,i’m going to tell her what she knows already(all laugh) just the officiality that’s all but it’s..my sweet May..she..(all laugh)..’,had tears again(all laugh) this is perfect dishonesty of honest hallucinations(all laugh) yeah throughout Frontier i had Feraligator(all laugh) so now i hugged him(all laugh) then again created a bit of distance and said,’it’s ok man,it’s ok,i just felt thus said you’re my bro as well Drew by all means and yeah i know that i cherish my girlfriend’s mind only(all burst into laughter)’..now the brat as usual was trying to punch me but Bayleaf resisted of course and vine whipped the brat’s mouth and the brat was on the ground of course and Bulbasaur was also brought in for this so special occasion(all laugh) i taught them this exact move for 7 days before(all burst into laughter) and i was in tears laughing and that brat too had tears of anger(all laugh) then i said,mate first stay mumb,i have a girlfriend too i understand your situation currently(all laugh) stay there and listen(all laugh),this i said for that exact reason mental stuffs change as you know like today greatest caring wife tomorrow biggest cheating brat(all laugh) and so on those aren’t the person they are situational and many more that’s only the inner veil beyond which the real person is the who if honest to herself the rest automatically comes  generousity,warmth,gallantry and the character traits sweetness,NAIVETY(all laugh) and so on this is to inform you that i’ll reject my girlfriend when she doesn’t help me to beat me in battles(all laugh) then i let him off was extremely grave(all laugh),’hmm..JEALOUSY,SPITE,VENGEANCE,MALICE(all burst into laughter)..you namecall WHAT IS YOUR TROUBLE HUH(all laugh)’..’that the lost year is vomitted beforehand so the span will be safer(all burst into laughter)’ now that brat was still angry and said,’yeah,yeah,VULGARITY(all laugh)..hence the future card(all laugh)..you..(all laugh)..WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME HUH(all laugh)..’,’daddy didn’t leave mommy(all laugh)’,’yeah ILLEGALITY(all laugh),DIVORCING MIDWAY(all laugh),CHEATING AROUND(all laugh)..you namecall i’m calling May(all laugh)’,’i cherish you sweetie no matter your infidelity(all laugh)..’ now this was devastating stuff(all laugh) so the brat gets extremely dejected with all sorts of insinuations and possibilities and then the reason why i said as well the testing of his true self and heart(all laugh) so becomes grave again(all laugh),’Ash,i understand patch-up and remarriages and re divorces and re-breakups and TAKING CARE OF STEP-CHILDERN AS WELL(all burst into laughter)..’,’yeah the preparation(all laugh)’,this was more dumbfounding(all laugh) so now the brat is too confused cause he’s 20(all laugh) then screams,’YOU WANT ME TO BREAK UP FROM MY MAY..YOU MASKED TRAITOR(all laugh)..’,then was trying to punch me again(all laugh) so the two buddies of mine shut the brat up(all laugh)..then i was in tears laughing all the way(all laugh),’yeah why cause she’s not my flesh and blood she’s not my sis(all laugh)’,this was insinuating as well(all laugh) then i let him go and he sits up but doesn’t stand up(all laugh) says,’yeah,yeah i realize(all laugh)..SO MUCH CARE THAT STILL I’LL INSINUATE AROUND THE FACT THAT I’M NOT HER OWN FLESH AND BLOOD(all laugh)..if your sweet sweet Mist flower had a bro then you..you..(all laugh)’,’would’ve told him i want her to expand her being beyond this current confinement so that to her and me she is the real self hence i can see her as the reality not via this VEIL of psychophysicality(all burst into laughter) and she agrees with me’..anyway(all burst into laughter),then i said,’see Drew this is the VEIL to hide the vulgar(all burst into laughter)..’,’so your grudge against the idea of pre-marriage relations is beacuse of the fact that this Bayleaf doesn’t understand the meaning of spouse(all burst into laughter)’,’well during breeding season i asked her what is the difference between projection and rejection(all burst into laugter),she projects herself then someone comes whoose projection matches her but then she changes her mind hence projection and rejects him and so on she said to her understanding it means the maximum potential of the offspring is the fundamental hindrence to faith(all burst into laughter) and it’s cause of this insecurity of being a confined dependent mom(all brust into laughter) but then said anyway,another is ever there what’s the big deal isn’t it(all burst into laughter)..Trace buffoon(all laugh)...”
Trace(laugh) : “yeah,you brat(all laugh) i’m not buffoon enough to understand who taught this great philosophy to all of those damn brats hence during breeding season they pester me to death cause they want me to be their communication channel(all burst into laughter) and this pest himself made all three of us communication channels between him and that brat of a Gyarados of his(all laugh)..too sweet girl isn’t she Mist..Mist(all laugh)..”
Misty(irritated,same pose,Ash bursts into laughter and hugs her quickly then same pose) : “SHUT UP!(all laugh)..i’m way more polite and my nickname is way better than your namecalled Dase(all burst into laughter)..SHUT UP!(all laugh)..Ash,why these namecalls disturb our personal life..(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “cause you’re my toffee-flower(all laugh)..so,then Bayleafian marriage was  revealed to shrew(all laugh) then shrew said,yeah,yeah MARRIAGE-THEORY(all laugh),what is your trouble man that i want to confirm to her that she’s my soulmate NOT IN YOUR WORDS(all laugh) and i want it AFTER 4 YEARS NOT 8 TO TELL HER THAT DISCRETELY(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,that moment that is(all laugh),but shouldn’t you inform the younger gen(all burst into laughter) then Drew says,’yeah slapped first(all laugh) still takes 8 years asks those questions and also whether you like your girlfriend if during formalities she vomits on your face AGAIN AND AGAIN EVERY TIME(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter),while you say i cherish you EXACTLY THEN BECOMES MAD AND BITES YOU EACH TIME(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter),when you approach her is ok but then SUDDENLY SAYS I DON’T KNOW YOU PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY SPITS AT YOU SCREAMING HELP EACH TIME TO PLAY YOU(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,Lillie uncontrollably laughs in tears and fits of laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) and then you behave to the whole world as if a child INCLUDING YOUR GIRLFRIEND FOR 8 DAMN YEARS THROUGH VOMITS’(all burst into laughter)..how many times have you fallen ill in 9 years yourself huh?(all laugh)..’,’only once in first within the very first three weeks and then none and never vomitted(all laugh)..Brock and Trace never(all laugh) Max 2-0 and May 4-1(all laugh) Mist did though 3-1-1(all burst into laughter)..last time food didn’t suit her 5th year 6th date my bad(all burst into laughter)..’,’yeah so hands on training first then 4(all burst into laughter) and i guess except last time your jacket was volunteered to be confiscated(all burst into laughter)’,’ no never on my dress or face misfortune really(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter)...’,’yeah so mingled in food and then(all uncontrollably laugh)...’,’yeah first region thrice that’s same number of cup wins against me(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) numbered surprizingly 3 (all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) and total vomits 5 times face to face battle also 5 times surprizing as well(all burst into laughter) but i fell ill 1/5 number of competitions i lost in total that’s the strange number 5(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,.) ONE IN 5 you see,as the emotions(all uncontrollably laugh,fits and convulsions of laughter,tears),anyway but if Blaziken vomits on Flygon..(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears)’...’finally again for your vomit cleaner(all laugh) just the level of confidendence that while cleaning i will not vomit too(all burst into laughter) OR DURING(all uncontrollably laugh,tears)’,’only if she sanely watches and appreciates this veil exactly why her sanity is useful to you not to her isn’t it(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter)’,’Ash,you’re crossing that type of limit(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laugh)’,’who is helped Drew(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,yeah BIG BROTHER(all burst into laughter),I REFUSE TO BE YOUR LITTLE BRO(all laugh)..AND SHE WOULD’VE REFUSED YOU TOO IF SHE KNEW THESE(all laugh) ESPECIALLY THE INSINUATIONS(all laugh)..’,’she does for 4(all burst into laughter)’ this number game was also insinuation but double edged(all laugh) now the brat is totally dumbfounded(all laugh) so i said,’there are many 4s aren’t there(all laugh)’,then the brat disdainfully says,’yeah,i guess to become your sis also had to pass these hells(all laugh)’,’of course(all laugh),i told her lets go to the shop here itself i’ll get you a brand new bike refused it cunning(all laugh)’,’cause alone(all laugh) man she was 16 then(all laugh)’,’hence(all burst into laughter)’,’i see so your flower isn’t alone then(all laugh)’,’well to be honest no is the answer for the insinuation as well(all laugh)’,now the brat didn’t insunate of course(all laugh) so scoffs at me(all laugh),’man,you’re a vulgar weed(all laugh)..’,’hence studied it well(all burst into laughter)’,’what is your trouble actually man(all laugh)’,'the knowledge that first hubby returns to first wife,who now also first to another,who truely thinks she is not just another and hence the care is grand why(all burst into laughter)' then shrew at this double edged insinuation about two places of me and my almost fainted(all laugh) so the brat was devastated(all laugh) so was vine whipped and sealed again(all laugh) then i said,'now neither first wife nor her first hubby ever wanted to break up hence returned but in illusion the first wife became first wife to another whoose name is SPEW(all burst into laughter) no at this self created trash talking and at then that tone i laughed so much the brat being 20(all laugh) almost had tears i guess not of joviality at all(all laugh) then i said,hence the first's wife's second hubby of course(all laugh) tendered her much but didn't go in future with her at all(all laugh) by every means(all laugh) now the brat had convulsions(all laugh) and all then the first hubby comes and then the first wife is also out of her illusion so they now want to patch up cause her second hubby also realized he all along was in an illusion to being with thus the happily part with a condition(all laugh)..now the brat was a step away from being hospitalized(all laugh)..the second says,before parting from here i want to say this to thee/that this situation comes to an happy ending at the cost of me(all laugh)/hence i decided to jump inside the great Cinnabar to flee(all burst into laughter)/i consumed something before coming here now the time is just see(all uncontrollably laugh)..the brat fainted(all laugh) so was woken up again by every means(all laugh) then i said,thus at moment i ask you to show me via you/that you are a MAN,so that you surely will be shrew(all laugh)/you won't go in the future by any means and will not let this promise to SPEW(all laugh)/every other means that you know will be avoided cause you know the truth hence why would you bother then DREW(all laugh)..now the brat is 20 and this is most heinous stuff that i had the probability of facing at 35 hence sadly the philosopher was fed this idea(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) then i let the brat off was extremely solemn(all laugh),says,'Ash,why this drama straight tell me you don't agree with my relationship to May(all laugh)','but not to my sis(all laugh)' then the brat tried to hit me(all laugh) so was shackled down(all laugh) then i said,'mate i'm 5 years older to you and have had my own girlfriend for 9 long years now and you know how sweet and simple she is in heart and yeah i knew what she wanted since day 2(all laugh) but that was then this is now,nothing to anyone but i must know where i'm(all laugh) actually you see trying to know that is why i had that illusion which of course Reshiram drove away(all laugh)where(all laugh)..man what a brat that is,anyway,then i let him off and said,are you now sanely vomitting still(all laugh),the brat was extremely grave said,'yeah,what you actually are i realized today now(all laugh),you are such a lowlife(all laugh) and you won't have any considerations from me anymore though you helped me much and i will ever appreciete that bit just that(all laugh) but you see these attempts of yours to foil my life will not succeed cause i will tell May what i should've without your knowledge as i see and thus deceit is what you want and what you do with everyone veiling your profession and thus your interactions with your bunch(all laugh) you will get that deceit from me too in return and look i still am showing you that it won't be so,thus well Ash,just thanks and bye(all laugh)','stupendusly precise lecture,no wonder you can't win 5 minutes with such intricate calculative prowess(all laugh)',the brat was trying to go away without anwer so was bounded down(all laugh) then gravely said do you want to break rules(all laugh),i said yeah why not(all laugh),then the brat said but i won't(all laugh),i said thus you can't win(all laugh) it's still double edeged saw(all laugh)','Ash,what do you want(all laugh)','this reverts back to your question of what my trouble was my method to hallucinate back to the starting point by every means to break your connection with your brat(all laugh) hence you lose without being attacked(all laugh) rhyms saw(all burst into laughter)','this only tells me who you are at heart again so you're at similar bay(all laugh)','hence we're battling illegally aren't we thus you lose by your own words that you won't do so(all laugh)','yeah i've realized what devil has ushurped May(all laugh) and no i'm not a lowlife like you so i'm not insinuating cause i know her too well(all laugh)','hence can't take this(all laugh)','have been till this point(all laugh) and no this again isn't the answer to your insinuation and goal(all burst into laughter) that won't happen Ash unless you kill me which you may(all laugh)','thus i'm(all laugh)' now shrew returns to the real sweet spewed self cause realized whhat i'm doing with him(all laugh),'you brat(all laugh),what was that(all laugh)',’that i had innumerable crushes from 11-14.5 and then wanted to free my being up from my self cause Squirtle told me so(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,hence the obsession with the asbtract questions getting utmost brats like Snorlax and Crawdaunt and Feraligator and Solgaleo etc to their fullest possible lunacy(all laugh)’,’that’s freedom Drew that my flower has now(all burst into laughter)’,’man what sort a person are you’,’suspecting my girlfriend hence the previous illegal battling hence veiling my feelings for her currently to herself yeah(all laugh)’,’so that if other people have crushes on her you’re free of any troubles cause ONLY I CLEAR THE VOMIT(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,but her second hubby will too that's the counter isn't it(all laugh)','man please get rid of this veil(all laugh) what the hell are you doing even(all laugh)','just sharing my experiences Drew with you cause you're enough a shrew(all laugh) being so sweet sweet thus this one you should SPEW(all burst into laughter)','yeah,knows my weak point so taking the liberty beyond every imaginable limits now(all laugh) exactly what the brats do AND ARE DOING'..at this time Banette was tickling him(all burst into laughter) so spew couldn't get angry either(all laugh) so then i stooped the brat and told him,'it’s just that the complexion or generosity isn’t the reality so it’s like a mosquito bite now feels next moment totally erased(all laugh) and yeah about each insinuation of the posterity(all laugh),it's just that i don't care really from my point of view that is if my umpteenth illusion broke off no matter at which time if the same for her as well all the in-betweens simply are useless to me aren't they(all laugh)','man do you have any idea what are you demanding from me at 20(all laugh)','just that pomise at last moments(all laugh) yeah the insinuation is here of course you know me(all laugh)',the brat sighs(all laugh),says,'man,i understand what my own big bro would've NEVER done(all laugh) if i had one and YOU ARE NOT ONE(all laugh)','have you grasped the thing i'm talking about(all laugh)','yeah just..','much is left listen carefully(all burst into laughter)' now the brat is again sealed(all laugh) then i say,'if you don't have the illusion anymore and come to know that she's living happily stay single never show your face and never bother,else you cheat she doesn't you're not her(all laugh)...well this was my illusion then as well(all laugh)','then not bothering means removing all tangible memories and the ones that are not won't go but her current happiness must be included she's not dead after all is she(all laugh)','then if she is not happy first find out if this was 3rd or not hence you're behind 2nd now(all laugh) then too go bback to the first step unless you know yeah it might be you so,then only go there taking the right steps only to start with(all laugh) then yeah if the promise comes you should agree legally that is(all laugh) cause else just blood and sweat ain't it ever another(all laugh) and the rest you will realize only if you STUDY(all laugh) i can't say all cause i'm just a mere novice am not i(all laugh)',then i let him off after intricate lecture on the ulterior(all laugh) the brat now says,'yeah these are what is taught to that brat like Solgaleo hence only he is that mad(all laugh)','he was asked to distance himself from himself for me(all burst into laughter) which no human can cause you see this got him thoughtfull(all burst into laughter) hence he was mad at times of course(all laugh) then he realized it's his idea of himself as a being and thus me as same and thus different to him is what was hindering him so he is in pursuit to discard sanity(all burst into laughter) well tamed isn't he(all laugh)',but um..Gary any help(all laugh)..'
Gary(laugh) : "you calling me by name(all laugh) is rather a blessing now for me which again is insinuated of course(all laugh),man we knew about hard hard times for poor Drew but this is heinous(all laugh) no wonder the poor kid drew 3(all laugh) and no wonder that the whole world is after you of course encouraging in-born pests to become limitlessly mad(all laugh).."
Ash(all laugh) : "no they are independent of me as you all know(all laugh),man Gary you have been fodnled by many but Madgaleo was truely mad all time including Unova(all laugh),anyway,then shrew says,'yeah i get it what will happen to your opponents(all laugh) but Misty is in too cunning hands i can see(all laugh),'no look i can be nice too(all laugh) do you have any confusion so as to whether May on the other hand has been tested like this or not(all laugh)','don't bother she is mentored in every aspects of life by her sis-in-law herself(all laugh)..hence sis-in-law is never Gyaradosy except ASH!how could you call me Misty(all laugh,Ash laughs at Misty who smiles at Ash),thus is so sweetly ponytailed(all laugh) anyway,then i told him,'see nice family ain't it(all laugh) but do you want to know why my flower is my wife and why May is my sis and Brock is my bro and Trace too and you(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,most ENGAGING(all burst into laughter),AND SPARE ME FROM YOUR DIRTY FEATHERS(all laugh)’,'well,my flower seemed for 8 years mostly beyond psychophysical plane to me and that feeling of that appearence was of the type of soulmate(all laugh) so she’s my wife and so on(all laugh) but none escaped tests except exactly her for obvious reasons on both accounts(all laugh) cause she was tested by different scales to all of you(all laugh)’,’yeah i guess your Chu told you(all laugh)’,’no Pidgey evolved for no reason twice in the same day the day after being caught why Drew(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,according you the reason is TOO MUCH BOMHOMIE(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah hence my flower’s actions with me were similar(all laugh)..anyway(all burst into laughter),she was with me for no reason at all and you know her 10 years now exactly same no matter her outer developments hence saying my Mist is my Mist no change at all and hence the marriage,now mental but whole wolrd knows the eventual(all laugh)’,’hence this great lie detection(all laugh) and who evolved in May’s case that brat Sceptile wasn’t it(all laugh)’,’no Corpish(all burst into laughter),Sceptile became so in 3 weeks Crawdaunt took 4(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah and this insinuating number games is double edged with one edge being the 4 is of “ling” and 3 is of “sib”(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah hence two evolutions were necessary(all burst into laughter),if Pidgey stayed at Pidgeoto would’nt have been so easy for me i want utmost freedom from being you see(all burst into laughter)...anyway(all burst into laughter),same for Max as well cause Snorunt to Glalie 2 weeks(all burst into laughter) May was already confirmed so that was step 2(all burst into laughter) then Brock came i got two pokemons immediately before 3rd badge Bulbasaur and Squirtle both refused me first them sticked around they were tough people but had a bond with me,like Onix of wax(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing),then Trace came almost at the same time Lapras too(all laugh) then i don’t recall who came but Trace at day one asked me and Mist if we were like already agreed to marry(all laugh) this was step one(all laugh) that he was as straight as that with strangers(all burst into laughter) so i asked him how do you make sketches of woman(All burst into laughter) he nonchallantly without any thought or any smirking said non-attachment(all burst into laughter) just that laugh told me he is too naive(all burst into laughter) which confirmed my intuition that my pokemons will be very well served,especially psychics(all burst into laughter) and his bunch only 2 didn’t know the difference between power and potential(all burst into laughter) hence never evolved(all burst into laughter) i said but long practise i guess(all burst into laughter) said well i never did it before(all burst into laughter) but do you want one with your best friend(all laugh) i said yeah if you can yeah she would like it(all laugh),second yeah didn’t catch his attention(all burst into laughter) then made the sketch and Mist destroyed it in jubilation(all burst into laughter) but later told me so sweet(all laugh) i said yeah right don’t do what you did next time(all laugh)’,’yeah,such a nice and sweet person PLAYED HER FOR 8 YEARS(all laugh)’,’just like Lucario yeah(all laugh)’,’man you’re a most heinous fox(all laugh)’,’hence Trace is my bro for life for sure(all uncontrollbaly laugh) not our though(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) that was confirmed by Marshadow(all burst into laughter) i made Trace and Mist battle with Scyther vs Poliwrath(all laugh) Marshadow was referee(all burst into laughter) told him whichever pokemon gets tired help him if he could differentatiate their idea of their masters’ propensity vs stability to his own idea of my decision vs solution(all burst into laughter)..he couldn’t(all burst into laughter) told me thier view of their masters matches interchanges thus thay don’t consider them to be separate hence your question lad,isn’t valid at all in their case(all burst into laughter),did you get it Drew(all laugh)’,’yeah,THE GREAT GHOSTLY PHILOSOPHER said hence our bro and not ONLY mine(all laugh)’,’right hence your Absol told me the vision of night sky is most suited to contemplation than fear(all burst into laughter)’,’he only said he understands the difference between dark and light(all burst into laughter)’,’the whispers Drew,did you get it(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,IN BETWEEN LINES(all laugh) congrats man congrats if a brat like you is a travel companion may God bless us(all laugh) AND YOUR WIFE(all laugh)’,’yeah,thanks(all laugh) but Brock’s case was different but before that would you agree Trace that Marshadow is born such(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “man,your wife liked the answer to your question so much repeated twice in the space of just a few hours(all laugh),yeah i remember this brat asked about gender WIDE issues in sketches(all laugh) i didn’t get it then(all laugh) later realized it cause he has ever been too overprotective of his flower in handshakes only(all laugh) but then that pest Marshadow was set upon me and has been pestering me for 19 damn years(all laugh)..but the trouble is he will depend only on his pokemons to get anything first time(all laugh),Dave’s case was Bulbasaur(all laugh) but he was 31 then much more cunning and so the process was smooth(all laugh)..and don’t teach these to my daugters till they are 20 atleast(all laugh)”
Ash(laugh) : “just so naive(all laugh),they will be taught at 10 by Conhoopa only as well(all laugh),but you understand that is the root of family(all laugh)..but well about family what is Mr Oak’s opinion Mr Oak(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) :  “two words(all laugh)..really this pest as long as wasn’t here all were so happy and all you Gyarados couldn’t you stay single or um.. or um..(all burst into laughter)..”
Misty(frown,irritated,hugging Ash very firmly and resting her head on his chest in same pose,Ash bursts into laughter and hugs her then back to same pose) : “SHUT UP!(all laugh)..my sweet Ash was being mentally tortured by namecalls..and(all laugh) YOU WERE ENJOYING YOUR VACATION WITH THAT DAMN NAMECALLED WIG(all laugh)..Ash,cut this call(all laugh)”
Ash(laugh) : “my sweet Mist ponytail(all laugh)..right(all laugh),so then i continued with SPEW(all laugh),i said,’yeah,Brock’s case was different the wax Onix meant just so naive(all laugh) then i realized he is too caring and then it was easy cause me and Mist both were 16,he 21(all laugh) in case of Trace it was 18 and 22 so more experienced(all laugh) anyway,so May was too insecured with herself on the forestin the first 8/9 days that we trekked and then one day was scared at night Max was too little so fell asleep in fear(all laugh) and May just couldn’t sleep and in midnight i went out once then return and she hugged me to death was too scared and i then patted her off later after Treecko evolved and Corpish too for no reason and both were too attached to me and naive(all burst into laughter) yeah Crawdaunt is rather nasty and wants me as comrade-at-arms(all laugh) Feraligator came to plan with me on wickedness(all laugh) Trace wasn’t there then actually(all laugh) but i had learnt the tricks after 1 year of too much bonhomie(all laugh)..anyway,then i continued,so then i realized May is too insecured with herself and then later Brock came along and my brats evolved as did May(all burst into laughter) but their nature and relation with me only deepened and Snorunt to Glalie confirmed that cause Glalie was insecured but very perceptive as Snorunt and then evolved into Glalie and was much steady like Max(all laugh) and his relation with me too only deepened and hence they both are my sister and bro then once i told May that look we’re not flesh and blood still so may be the shared ribbon isn’t right given my then name and all i was under scrutiny so the troubles and i insiuated what i’m insnuating to you to my sis she almost cried and hugged me and said how can they be so cruel and then herself said bro you still don’t think i’m your sis by all means and was very dejected and thus i had to tender her psychophysically cause that was hindering her self(all burst into laughter) and i then understood that she really is my sweet little sis cause i also didn’t think twice to do so it was natural and Max was similar and this also was supported by Sableye(all brust into laughter) cause i asked him what is not describable cause or reason(all burst into laughter) the reason why i asked him this is cause his view of this chain to the unfoldment of being to have a  glimpse of self thus to get more and more agitated was rather emotional(all burst into laughter) hence he couldn’t differentiate well between emotion and sentiment(all burst into laughter) cause emotion you can’t grasp at thus only cling at(all burst into laughter) and sentiment is rather stronger that where emotion fails hence sentiment comes forth he said the root of a feeling is in the logic of the very root that itself is the feeling(all burst into laughter) i said whhat is the logic then(all laugh) that is that all views like emotion and sentiment are to be upended again and again till they become indescribable hence mitigated(all burst into laughter) i said demonstrate it he tickled me(all burst into laughter) i realized he said this sensation or sentiment or emotion are being upended so the reason why you laugh at being tickled no matter your sentiment and so on is a physical thing only but it lords over your semotion and makes your mind agitated so they are interlinked thus if i’m again and again tickled but now mentally which Sableye meant actually(all brust into laughter) then the indescribable only remains that is the glimpse of self then that agitates you to have more is that’s reflected somewhere someone on same path similar to you so much as to you don’t feel anything else about them like a..(all laugh)’,’yeah,wife(all laugh) and then with varying degrees siblings,family etc..and this that dark meance told you(all laugh)’,’yeah i realized that May and me have a deep bond true siblings the same way i felt about Brock and Trace and Gary actually is a sibling in a way it was natural(all laugh) but why is Mist my wife not sis Drew(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,if you have the same feelings to others only then she is your wife and then it will be tested(all laugh) and for others too what is a friend then Ash(all laugh)’,’yeah this i asked Pangoro actually(all burst into laughter) i asked him do you understand the difference between mask and masking(all burst into laughter) this was cause he thought he was an individual being(all burst into laughter) then he told me mask is the way to naturalize the unmasking(all brust into laughter) and masking is the meance to achieve the reverse(all burst into laughter) that is a mask is used to observe the self from being and masking is to observe being from self but both knows the being the later is more desperate cause it’s more unhappy but the first is more in trouble so if the two are mixed up you give a question and provide the answer of the same to the opponent(all burst into laughter) then he is desperate to try to understand the reasoning behind it and gets dejected that cause this answer confines his view that one of the ways is this so why create another or do try to create another so he is either interested or dissapointed too much hence you win cause you know such is the nature of mask and masking so now he’s doing the same hence you tell him you’re trapped cause you didn’t realized that we both are already in it to being with so you’ve only worsened your case(all burst into laughter) he will go to his master now for solutions but he will be unable to provide any cause the whole process is such it’s been shown so in agitation he will break down hence Pangoro wins and is dejected exactly because of how he won thus gets closer to the self than being without mask or masking(all burst into laughter) if Pangoro was told this he would’ve said this idea that a question and answer exist isn’t this why we are in trouble that one specific has been pointed out to me that is i’m an individual hence where the scope except not accepting it but see i ever say i’m same as my master so why are you confined(all burst into laughter) this will cajole opponent to use own brain too much hence fails(all laugh) is this was said to Pangoro(all burst into laughter) he will repeat the previous procedure only cause the opponent again has answered himself while questioning and thus this game goes on till one master thinks that he’s human(all burst into laughter) thus the counter but there are innumerable such ways so each ways have a opposite that’s spouse(all burst into laughter),two mutually exclusive ways are current strangers and the mutually dependent ones are if partial family and friends according to degree and and totally dependent ones are singles(all burst into laughter) so i realized that  my nature and May’s are partially mutual to the siblings folder according to Pangoro hence it must be right cause he can’t understand human emotions so he’s neutral isn’t he(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,what a lecture,bravo,stupendus,mind-blowing,ENLIGHTENING(all laugh) so a dark fighting meance of a brat told you how to detect family and that ghostly dark meance told you May is your sibling and Sceptile and Crawdaunt confirmed it(all laugh) this is your way to judge people(all laugh) and all these questions,insinuations and sentimental cards you’re playing with me for 3.5 years are to test me but this the GREAT COUNTERING PACKAGE THAT SHE WILL BECOME MORE TRAPPED IN HER SISTERLY WIGS WITH YOUR CARE AND THESE TESTS PROPORTIONALLY TO MY DISSENTMENT WITH YOU AND THEN MAY OVERFLOW TO HER AND SHE WON’T BELIEVE ME EVEN IF DO WILL GO EVEN BEYOND YOU AND SO THIS IS A WAY TO REMOVE ME(all laugh)..THIS IS THE REAL VEIL(all laugh)’,’so postphoned then(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah, if you want we will do that IN FRONT OF YOU(all burst into laughter) BUT I WILL TELL MAY WHAT I FELL ABOUT HER WHICH IS TRUE NO MATTER YOUR SOLGALEO’S POINT OF VIEW(all laugh)’,’i..i can’t live without my grilfriend(all laugh)..’,’man,please just shut it you’ve..’,’delayed it thus spoiled that mood,now only the determination remains so if that mood was polite now the vulgarity is visible to naked eyes as well Drew see this joy of victory after a prolonged match,so ENGAGING(all burst into laughter)’..Mr Oak Mr Oak why is called food(all burst into laughter)..”
Gary(laugh) : “man,this pest if had been here during our moments would’ve humilated us(all laugh)..OR HIS WELL TAMED CHU BRO(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “personally in a professional manner(all laugh),anyway,then the brat said,’yeah,yeah,CONGRATULATINONS FOR TESTING MY NERVES(all laugh)..just tell me if..(all laugh)’,’i can’t tolerate the smell i’ll use a mask(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter)’,’man you’re a godforsaken animal(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears)’,’cause vomit,smell,body,mind,gender none are vulgar but then my gender..(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,THANKS FOR THE EMOTIONALLY MORAL ADVICE(all burst into laughter) and don’t bother i won’t do ANYTHING AT ALL(all laugh)’,’hence Pangoro says,Florges-reddened vs Absol-rosened 12 mili in 7micro as vomitscale neither mask nor masking(all laugh)’..but are my sisters all alive(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “man this is most brutal gruelling imaginable(all laugh)..but,but i cherish your mad vomitting so much(all burst into laughter)...mastery in sane vomit lulling(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) jackal you sweet second cousin mask is madly diving in vomit pool AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH A MASK(all uncontrollbaly laugh,fits of laughter,tears)...”
Tracey(laugh) : “seeing the Dase through bright and pale/cleaning the vomit through mask,tooth and nail(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,Ash cheers for Tracey all laughs even more,Daisy in tears and fits and convulsions of laughter)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “my lion did you point the coming vomit tell(all burst into laughter)..”
Gary(laugh) : “hope only i’m not asked if i faced that hell in ages(all burst into laughter)..”
Violet(laugh) : “actually Ash was caringly inspired(all uncontrollably laugh,Brock .ly laughs,Violet in tears laughing)..”
Ash(laugh) : “familially(all uncontrollably laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing)”
Brock(laugh) : “you brat don’t come anywhere near foods(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “what do you know about how moist the vomit shouldn’t be(all unocontrollbaly laugh,Brock .ly laughs),so...anyway(all burst into laughter),then after even i said you pass,shrew was dissapointed(all laugh),’said man i get you that you want to test me but these are too much(all laugh)’,’yeah the insinuations’,’man please i know she herself volunteered to travel around with you in this region and all the 1.5 years and so on cause she really do get her feelings towards you reciprocated by you that you two are truely siblings..’,’hence the tests(all laugh) and all the more cause after this region may be i’ll meet her 5/6 years later only physically all phones and videos in-between so even more you see all at once(all laugh)’,’yeah,i get it but man,you tortured me(all laugh)’,’cause you will be travelling alone i guess only with your wife(all laugh)’,’yeah,i don’t want any brats suddenly becoming our travel companions and pester us and so on all aren’t Tony even this travel companion of mine you know wasn’t good for me and the previous to this same,Tony was so good then this region bad experience and you despite knowing everything AND advising me how to hold my nerves there did these cause you know my weak point(all laugh)’,'cause i know she is only infatuated with you thus your tests were just a trial to give you strenght during your heartbreak helping your real soulmate hence bro i cherish you so much(all uncontrollbaly laugh)','man just..','see if i know this much surely i know the other gender as well don't i feelings are universal as are that among siblings(all burst into laughter)','yeah now i've been forced against my wish to be your sibling hence this insinuation now(all laugh) yeah tell me which brat confirmed May's feelings to me BUT I KNOW AS WELL MYSELF WHAT SHE THINKS OF ME(all laugh)','hence only you know hence she should as well thus i've been confirmed just now though(all burst into laughter)','yeah,bravo with insinuation mastery(all laugh),atleast your madcap bunch wasn't involved(all laugh)','unlike today(all laugh),no she just asked me how to test you apart from bias and trash talking(all laugh) i said hence you've been fished don't bother(all laugh) see too sweet a kid my sweet little sis(all laugh)','yeah have to be with a brat of a big bro like this(all laugh)','and my flower told her,just let it flow(all burst into laughter),'yeah realized what she said and what you are saying EXACTLY LIKE YOUR TRANSLATORS(all laugh)',’yeah,cause you’re too sweet a kid,i truely cherish you so much(all laugh)’ then i hugged the brat to death while Bayleaf and Bulbasaur vine whipped him and messed his hair up,fondled him while hugging and kissed his forehead(all laugh),then tickled him along with Banette(all laugh) and so on after that 1 hour session or 2 the brat absolutely loathed me(all laugh) and now spew says man that day you made me feel heinous of myself(all laugh) anyway so then after the formalities(all laugh) which didn’t go by my sister’s plans of long costly sermons(all laugh) Brock is told later by sis herself(all laugh) and also her obvious decision to go to Johto(all burst into laughter) i wasn’t cause i poked Drew didn’t talk with me that day and the next(all laugh) cause Drew gravely pointed out that your bro only told me 20-19 is 1 and nothing else(all burst into laughter) so Brock knows it on 3rd day who on that day told me to learn from Drew(all burst into laughter),i said both you and your flower are gym leaders so it’s upto you(all burst into laughter) so the philosopher comes out(all laugh) distance is longing(all burst into laughter) so i realized that he is needed to be called immediately(all laugh) so then on 4th day i used the sentimantal card(all laugh) i said are you forgetting your family cause of you’re in 12th (all burst into laughter) then scoffs at me saying ‘i thought of slapping him(all burst into laughter) but um..’(all laugh)...so i said yeah it was private(all laugh),huh you barely managed your gym match yesterday(all burst into laughter),yeah 4 days enough for next gym(all laugh) cause i trekked 331 out of 579(all laugh) and the next was a pre competition day(all burst into laughter),so i said surely i know why you of all Torchics wasn’t interested for your time limit against me yesterday(all laugh),’bro it’s..it’s..(all laugh)’...i said yeah just go with him happily too much yearning both side very pure according to me(all laugh) and now you’re 16 too(all laugh) then of course said that they were going to Johto and was emotional and hugged me and cried her head off(all smile) i sistersit her then say it won’t matter and we’re family and all and Drew is a very very good guy(all laugh) simply see his behaviour with you and just his talents and and still in fact apologised to you and me as well that if you or we think it’s because of that defeat it’s not so cause he himself is travelling alone now cause his travel companion has parted and you know Tony(all laugh) so many times we’ve met him and and even you talk with him similar nature Drew is as good a person as it gets if not way better and we’re seeing him for 4 years now we all know he’s just a sweet spewed kid(all burst into laugter) just wants his girlfriend with him in all honesty but now we also must add ethics and then question furthur(all laugh) then i said i asked him very discomforting questions a few times over the years(all laugh) and know well he didn’t ever had anything else than true yearning for you and for more you saw even then he asked me before that(all laugh) and don’t worry just go along anyway then joke that just get married and move on it’s not that you’re going to mars we venus(all laugh) but tell Max about it(all laugh)...so finally my sis understands that i am cunning(all laugh) and was happy cause was wanting that assurence she being she ever a little kid and that was good Drew told her later about 7 great questions(all laugh) they were in Sinnoh by then Johto was risky(all laugh) they laughed their heads off then and actually all those contributed to my 4 years cause of all suddenly that view came back to me and jumped on my Mist and she became Misty(all laugh),Mist+objectivity or psychophysicality = Misty(all laugh)...anyway(all burst into laughter),so i wasn’t around here at all and no i don’t have any regrets for that i needed it myself and otherwise this today wouldn’t have been here and you all know the things but my only regret is that after undercover before going to Kalos i just should’ve abducted Mist(all laugh) plain and simple and force her to come away with me for 7 days and that would’ve been it that took 4 nore years and Mist suffered for that and that’s all the regret about it except my behaviour with you and my sis and all else cause i could be way more firm politely than i was impolitely,so anyway,after this come the question to Tony boy(all laugh) who was in Cerulian now guarding the gym unnecessarily(all laugh) and i ask him that just not in poems(all laugh) that the 7 is finally so travelling may be for 70(all laugh) so your 2 words(all laugh) on that he said very happy Drew ever told everything to him and he knew all those and Drew is truely like a little a little bro to him and so on was happy but wasn’t happy that i wasn’t marrying Mist(all laugh) i said look if Ketchum is added with Waterflower the gym being a water one will loose it’s dignity(all laugh) and so it should be only Ketchum(all laugh) and thus had fun anyway,Max is told next month and he was 17 by then was wanting to start his journey right next day(all laugh) but desisted only cause didn’t want to leave before our sis finished the current and we had only one month left then,Drew officially proposed May first when she was 20 and 3 and at 20 and 6 when i was 26,January our Kanto Frontier journey finished then next time i met my little sis physically was almost 11 years later(all laugh) by then she was 30 and had two daughters(all laugh) yeah the luck of being trainer(all laugh) anyway,back to Max he wanted to travel but still with us and more so cause he was at 15 dealing with the likes of Tyranitar and Solgaleo(all burst into laughter) yeah the normal ones(all laugh) so was too happy and by then everyone was telling me that how hard it is to be a Pokemon master cause you must do it in 21 and half years from your start if married or 20 and half if not and atmost your age can be 40 to get in hall of fame which is you must start at 22 latest and then travel one year less than me to get it(all laugh) that to with no protection means from your very second league at first round you can get a 7 time champion(all laugh) and i got it twice(all laugh) at Orange and then at Hoenn(all laugh) but Johto was Gary Oak(all laugh)...now they say can we time travel(all laugh) and the only protection is they have to go easy on you(all laugh) and still beat you with 9 left(all laugh) just so so hard and how it’s more than enough to even get to the 5 finals(all laugh) and then there is Tony boy(all laugh) suddenly decided to come to Cerulian of all places(all laugh) i told the brat why here..’um..isn’t electric types good at water gyms (all laugh)’ i said you’re asking me(all laugh)..’um..no Misty said you only have had 4(all burst into laughter)’ i said mate listen you travelled 3 regions Hoenn,Johto and Kanto being from Orange(all laugh) after you suddenly thought at Orange Charmander is perfect starter(all burst into laughter) then when you abjectly failed to convert the oceans there(all laugh) you got an Electrode of all(all laugh) then still didn’t win the league cause you ever wanted electric types at Orange(all laugh) so after a long vigil to pursue the whole Orange to give up water types(all laugh) you went to Kanto first then Hoenn and then battled me at EACH competitions there(all laugh) you had a Tapu Koko,Dedeme and finally secured a great Thundurus from Kanto of all places(all laugh) so was in psychic competitions as well(all burst into laughter) where you met ‘OH PSYCHO!MY PSYCHO!’(all burst into laughter) this got the lad very grave(all laugh) said,hey don’t always say..(all laugh),’PSYCHO,PSYCHO!YOU’RE SO SWEET SWEET PSYCHO!(all burst into laughter)..they weren’t confirmed then this is during Sinnoh when i was sane(all laugh) well both Tony and Braum was there at Sinnoh then as well when i was there but they travelled separately and none ever asked me to come with them or to include them in my group during travels except Clemont(all laugh)Melody well didn’t directly say(all laugh) and you know Tony,Braum and Harris all were 3.5 to 4 years roaming around at a region(all laugh) and Tony and Braum i said may i serve you(all laugh) they said only phone but travelling together with a brat like you never in a million years(all laugh),Brock didn’t ask me i asked who’s that pokemon(all laugh) and Mist said CORSOLA(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) man that was some day(all laugh),Trace we both sweared and dragged around with us as buttler(all laugh) and May was too overjoyed that first at bay what is to be done and then suddenly gets her big bro too happy(all laugh) then just jumped into my lap and shut her eyes sistersit your little baby sis or else(all laugh) and Max said this Torchic needs to be looked after and i will leave school and i’m 13 so(all laugh) then Sinnoh lady Dawn was at total bay as to what is the right amount of expression(all laugh) so we rather took her under our wings cause she was a real sample then(all laugh) and then Cili(all laugh)..Cili(all laugh)..Cili was ordered actually as you know(all laugh) and Iris came with him as bonus(all laugh)..WHERE’S KOMMO-O(all laugh) exactly why Cili was ordered you know him none in the world except my 4 comrades here would do what he did at Unova like that despite the fact that i bashed him each moment(all laugh)..Cili(all laugh)..but my family here would’ve had a hard time(all laugh) but it doesn’t include my flower cause she would’ve become mad with me and hence spoiled which i want now but she’s too Ashed(all laugh)..right(all laugh),anyway then finally Kalos i went as Yveltal(all laugh) then first i visit Christoper-Gower lab where Clemont was then spoke with me everyone knew me(all laugh) then said i want to travel and i have 230-230-72(all laugh) said it’s ok i’m so confused myself it’ll be perfect cause you’re a top notch professional just don’t kill me of exhaustion(all laugh) i said jump in then to date at Heatran den(all laugh) he didn’t get it then cause thought the word date was general then realized later what it is really(all laugh) that magazine(all laugh)..TYRAniTAR(all laugh)..anyway,then that greeting(all laugh) gets the brat very angry(all laugh),yeah,yeah lost 3 times so then(all laugh)..i said,’she also did SPEW(all burst into laughter)’ then sighs(all laugh),’man you’re too abstract for her not to get blindly infatuated(all laugh) what does she say(all laugh)’,’she cherishes your vomit so much(all burst into laughter)’,’man,mutual friends and this is your answer(all burst into laughter)..hey what if i do and(all burst into laughter)..’,’her vomit and your vomit if true vomit will mix to give 100% undiluted VOMITLUTION(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,solution is to sample vomit mixtures(all burst into laughter),just cut it..Ampharos..(all laugh)..’,’i FEEL it psycho,i..i..(all brust into laughter)’,’man,please,would you talk profession today(all laugh)’,’why are you here(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,ADVISE(all laugh)..when i marry her will not invite you,AMPHAROS(all burst into laughter)’..and Olivia you know too solemn(all laugh) after every discussion said,’yeah,but isn’t it true that if with psychic electric is mixed(all laugh)..’ or was saying,’yeah,thanks but i just recalled Dedeme..(all laugh)’ so i said,’complexion,complexion,complexion(all laugh)..’,’Ash,be polite(all laugh),neither me nor he are where we are for that which you know very well(all laugh)..’,i said,’Olivia listen,i’ve roamed around with my wife for 5 years since 16(all laugh) and what sort of Gyarados she was you saw first hand(all laugh) i know for what you two are where you are don’t waste your time just propose your Tony lad,you’re a great trainer and the expression of bias means break the traditions(all laugh)’,’um..but he also..(all laugh)’..so i knew about the two little pests but they didn’t escape tests(all laugh) cause they met first time right in front of me(all laugh) and spew yeah(all laugh) Brock,they needed you man they needed you(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “shouldn’t have entered this profession,Edmond is the most sly fox it turns out to be(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “just so naive(all laugh)..hows he though Violet and family haven’t spoke for sometime..”
Violet(laugh) : “just so naive(all laugh) Ellizabeth knows the tricks and Edmond ever gets in them just the profession is different but it’s just so naive(all laugh) and even Rodri gets his dad in traps(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “that’s just that dish(all laugh),anyway,then back to Tony,then i never asked anything about his and Olivia’s relations till Kanto Frontier break then during the break said comrades,collegaues,confederates(all burst into laughter),you two seem to be a little too close(all laugh) then Tony knew about vomits(all laugh) and Olivia got the same but much politer version only twice i asked her,only blood and sweat then(all laugh)’ was very angry(all laugh),’hum,you’re too happy with that Gyarados cause she’s blind so played her as much as you wanted(all laugh) i really like Tony but..um..(all laugh)..’,’yeah,it’s a profession WIDE issue all knows it(all laugh)’,’yeah,yeah,good friends so TESTING(all laugh) test that brat NOT ME(all laugh) i only ever..anyway(all laugh)..’,’cherished him so much(all laugh)’,’Ash,cut it(all laugh),Mr Mime..(all laugh)..’,so that was that then Olivia was asked this during deep Unova infact(all laugh) and this was after getting Guzzlord(all laugh) by then still they didn’t confess(all laugh) and whole world knew i was mad then(all laugh) so i was formal just asked,’you two are both of that age,find the soul else on yourself why the futile rage(all laugh)’,then she said,’yeah,will progess either we or bust(all laugh)’ i said just speak with him don’t go overboard he’s as desperate a Gyarados as you(all laugh) she said yeah thanks(all laugh) and then back to Tony the vomitlution was during Sinnoh and then i got the brat again at Sinnoh cause he had the great infatuation hurdle breaker himself(all laugh) otherwise Tony is so simple in the sense that he was like spew as well(all laugh) but never forward and Olivia since the first match was all in his mind so was shaky of loss(all laugh) and that little pest was enjoying that but completely Unown to her being a psycho(all laugh) and so Tony would’ve needed real help to see the real psycho behind the psychotic mask(all laugh) then Tony was longing for Olivia too much and she was as much but you now psychos(all laugh) i infact just got Guzzlord then(all laugh),both were contacted on same day cause 100% vomitlution dictates the FULL KOMMMO-O(all laugh)..Ash,they have family,don’t go to Huntelion(all laugh)..anyway,then back to Tony then asked him,’Tony many years of back and forth the age too is right profession and negotiations can be done during pre engagement period as well if beyond flesh and blood why wait just proceed atleast the real test is only then(all laugh)’,’yeah,man,yeah,a battle,the victroy,the conqueror(all burst into laughter)..’,i said don’t go overboard as much as i understand she has become a Gyarados inside as well as much as you can’t express you know her so be cautious(all laugh) then later they confessed during Unova as well but i was with Garchomp then(all laugh) then Braumy manual(all laugh) Braum is just a damn brat(all laugh) his nature is a formal version of Dave(all laugh) he actually met Flavia at Orange but the realtion blossomed later when i was at Unova(all laugh) just said this is after Huntelion(all laugh) they spoke about their personal life sometimes at Unova i ever said 1 minute given(all laugh) and you know each will have 1 minute of questions for me on everything(all laugh) as did Melody but she was full professional so was ok and personal phones were at night when i wanted to get sane a bit at Unova(all laugh) from 5-19 HUSH(all laugh) from 19-21,parties if any,21-22:30 Gary+Trace(all laugh)with dinners(all laugh)and then half an hour of Ciliution(all laugh) and then 23:00-23:30,Tony,Olivia,Braum and Harris(all laugh) each 7 minutes then 23:30-23:45,Sabrina(all laugh) then 23:45-23:55,a choisen leader or someone else for that day(all laugh) then barely could walk so fell asleep at 00:00 at 3:00 so they go,master brat what were you doing..how many beaus were you with(all brust into laughter) bring each brat already 3 hours 3000 matches beaus are getting short(all burst into luaghter) i said yeah toast for 3001st and jumped(all laugh) this was the overall view(all laugh) and no weekends same routine(all laugh) just one hour of cooking which was my personal connection with my travel companions(all laugh) so later started subtle body sleep from 2-4:30 when brats themselves were lights out after whole day of mental battling hence few chosen brats sneaked behind the hallucinations(all laugh) and both they and me were lunatics then so that subtle body sleep was some experience(all laugh)..anyway,then Braum i only asked once cause he is ever too zealous and manualized to know anything else unless the right(all laugh) very much like Dave but he atleast isn’t blindly dogmatic about manuals(all laugh) so Braumy manual was asked only once but only after Huntelion(all laugh),’mate are you roaming around or just letting the flow to flow and waiting for your soulmate if first congrats if second vomit(all laugh) must be as adored as the else(all laugh) cause there’s no psychophysicality so where’s YOU(all laugh) life’s hard but did i help(all laugh)’,’yeah,know about your ENDEAVOURS(all laugh) your manual says give me spit(all burst into laughter)..then according to the WRITTEN AMOUNT of your expansion of self DUE TO SPITS the soulmate is determined(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) surely such help is indespensible(all laugh) marry that Gyarados or you will regret bye(all laugh)..’ then that brat was down(all laugh) so next comes Harris son(all laugh),Harris son is too well known to me and the viseversa he never bothered cause ever said such Gyarados’ have no hope of getting cured(all laugh) i later said the two words to him and Kane of course(all laugh) Harris said,yeah,yeah,bless yourself that your wife is a Gyarados(all laugh) and Kane said,’this is defamation(all burst into laughter)’ then anyway,Harris son was with Brenda at Orange and his demeanour suggested too overhappy(all laugh) cause got Celebi(all burst into laughter) so i then said,’two persons rather than one on me Viriz,i’m running,runnig,running away Viriz and during the ride Viriz they were..aww...(all burst into laughter)..’,’Ash,find your own path(all burst into laughter)..and yeah it’s Virizion i don’t nickname she..anyway..(all burst into laughter)’..then during Sinnoh again,’i had a travel companion,can’t leave,don’t leave!(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,understood and much appreciated is your concern(all laugh) and Tapu Bulu..(all burst into laughter)..’,well you know among them the psudeo-legends division is,Olivia has Cresselia,Lunala ever says thank God not Madgaleo(all laugh) i say you’re expressive(all laugh) no man anything but Solgaleo(all laugh)..i say,well mine is an exceptional in-born brat but so many were beaten,THEY WERE SANE(all laugh) and you’ve scared me(all laugh) anyway,then she has Cresselia,Lunala,Jirachi and MARSHADOW(all laugh),then Braumy manual has TORNADUS(all laugh),Yveltal(all laugh) says mine is WAY BETTER TAMED MANUALLY(all burst into laughter) and Salamence(all laugh)..Salamencian life(all laugh)..Mega Salamence(all laugh)..man that was some meeting(all laugh),Tony boy has Tapu Koko and THUNDURUS(all laugh) and Harris son has Virizion,Tapu Bulu(all laugh) and Celebi(all laugh) thus no progress if born(all laugh) and for Harris son so that was the preliminaries then after Huntelion again(all laugh),’so many years now man,why don’t you settle down(all laugh)’,’after you return alive from there AS ASH KETCHUM NOT KOMMO-O(all laugh)..’,’year but are two still alone(all laugh)..’,’yeah don’t worry about the true vomits(all laugh) but Gyarados is truely vommiting being unhealthy literally return quickly now talk Celebi or bye(all laugh)..’ so Harris son was aww..(all laugh)..then finally Kane darling(all laugh)..Kane darling had real troubles cause first he was eye-witness to toffee-flower(all laugh) then second his girlfriend was toffee-flower’s best friend among girls(all laugh) and then most heinously third his little Hana sis was Vickie lad’s girlfriend(all laugh) so Kane darling ever tried to balance it(all laugh) so this is during Sinnoh and then Hana was in here as well as wife-friend to Vickie lad(all laugh) then i called Kane and said,’i cherish you so much(all laugh)’,’DON’T LET THAT GYARADOS ANYWHERE NEAR MY LITTLE SIS AND MY SWEET..anyway(all laugh)..just shut up and bye(all laugh)..’,then well i didn’t talk much with Kane on this cause i didn’t have as much contact with him being out of my profession that is to the extent i talked with Harris plus Mist knew everything about them anyway(all laugh) so then after Huntelion i said,’ages,ages,ages(all laugh),still confused if still time why delay the invitation man and the double from your sis as well(all laugh)’,’Unova has truely spoiled you,you know(all laugh) it’s ever one both sided and same for Hana as well BUT WE CAN’T INVITE A KOMMO-O IN A MARRIAGE CEREMONY MIND THAT(all laugh) and your Gyarados is not at all alright return WITHOUT KOMMO-O(all laugh) bye(all laugh)..’,so that was that and Harris,Kane are schoolmates,Irene was a nice girl i ever knew as was Brenda,Flavia i spoke with much later through Kane first Braumy boy was pretty late(all laugh) she was very formal and nice person but then again she has to wifesist according to manuals(all laugh),Tony,Braum and Olivia i know for so long so well but Violet sis,what is it that your hubby’s very sight makes everyone just so naive(all burst into laughter)..”
Violet(laugh) : “the opposite Gengar(all laugh) it’s just that thought that makes you so naive(all laugh)..which is..(all laugh)..”
All in Unison,except Brock(laugh) : “AH!FAMILY,FEELING and BOULDER!..(all burst into laughter)..”
Brock(laugh) : “yeah,you brat just move on(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “so NICE(all laugh),anyway,then during Tony’s Cerulian return i was saying that first you failed with a Charmader at Orange(all laugh) then got a Electrod,Dedeme and MANTINE(all laugh)..Violetine(all laugh)..and still a Glavantula(all laugh) so then you went to Kanto for 3 years and got finally Tapu Koko(all laugh) then went to Hoenn and got THUNDURUS(all laugh) and there you met your soulmate of psychotic connections(all laugh) and was alywas all over me with total 50 pokemons of 5 electric types(all laugh) and your Oliv branch was already riding me with her 100 psychics since Johto(all laugh) this was during Sinnoh as well they were there i told him and Braum and Olivia and Harris anyway knew that Cerulian,Cerulian..Cerulian..Cerulian..(all laugh) Cerulian was really getting huge and Mist flower only helped the growth so get jammed on her and she will give you perfect jobs(all laugh) and they got so(all laugh) Mist did so much for so many people here now they say yeah that gym is so important even outside profession(all laugh) i said yeah hence the behaviour should be and should’ve been right(all laugh) they said man you were known but as an Unown(all laugh) i said yeah,that feeling(all laugh)..anyway,Tony boy came to Cerulian when i totally insane at Unova(all laugh) but still once recalled Mist was crying so asked him of it(all laugh) asked are there too many pests(all laugh) gravely said more than you imagine send your ghosts(all laugh)..this i guess is after getting Garchomp as well(all laugh) and i got Noivern by himself in September,28,Dragonite by himself in October,28,Naganadel caught in October,28,Palkia by himself in November,28,Rayquaza caught in December,28 so withing 4 months including the very starting month i had 5 dragons and 2 psudeo-legends - a Palkia and a Rayquaza already(all laugh),then Goodra by himself in February,29,Hoopa by himself in March,29,Aegislash by herself in April,29,Dialga caught in May,29,Reshiram by himself July,29,Chaneldure by herself in same month in July,29,Kyurem caught in September,29 so in an year i already had  12(all laugh) including psudeo-legends,Palkia,Rayquaza,Goodra,Hoopa,Dialga,Reshiram,Kyurem(all laugh) and i don’t remember any other reginal orders or how they came except a few but order never except Unova cause it was madness then of TYRAniTAR(all laugh)..then Hydreigon by herself in November,29,Confragigus by himself in December,29 so i guess around this time i asked Tony cause i recalled i turned 30 or may be a bit before that it was then when he came to Cerulian and i got then Zekrom by herself in February,30 of course(all laugh) and it was probably Zekrom who reminded me of home(all laugh) so then i asked Tony about pests said too many send that Hoopa(all laugh) i said only Kommo-O(all laugh) then had Guzzlord by himself in March,30 in all due honesty of ethical honesty of morality in ethics of honesty of ethics(all laugh) and then Latios by herself in May,30 then Giratina ofcourse Mr Oak Mr Oak(all laugh) Giti was minutely taught to jump Mr Oak Mr Oak after his nature of pestering was revealed to be most irritating to Mr Oak and the Zeraora also said what type of Mr Oak(all laugh) Mr Oak Mr Oak why is it called type(all laugh)..then Giratina by himself in June,30 then finally Garchomp caught in August,30 and that was that within 23 months got 19 pokemons and 15 dragons(all laugh) with the addition of 4 more ghosts(all laugh) next 7 months find-self-brat,metally-battle-self,turn-self-on-self-again-to-get-more-self-brats,repeat(all laugh) so then that incident was at July and then () gym was August itself then Kommo-O class at Huntelion was at February,31(all laugh) then in March became sad so a bit sane(all laugh) then during Sinnoh,actually i thought of giving Mist my Sharpedo cause her Carvanha didn’t evolve(all laugh) cause that was taken care of by the human(all laugh) later when Mist got rid of the human immediately evolved and became a dreaded Sharpedo that even Goldy feared(all laugh) but first human activities then Mist managed him very closesly means Sharpedo can’t be spoiled(all laugh) but Mist always had Kyogre though(all laugh) didn’t want to use except in 3+ champs cases and so on but this Kyogre was all flustered as to substandard brats(all laugh) then Jellicent first and then Gyarados second jumped the fire so he followed suit(all laugh) and with this 3 it’s a circus now(all laugh) and no these 3 are cunning enough to not lull Ghostradarkarrigussonor(all laugh) then if that brat comes by they will just repeat my bunch’s methods ardently cause they like it(all laugh)...right(all laugh) and then that will be enough to get any legends tamed(all laugh) cause my Mist flower is so sweet(all laugh)..so anyway,then well Mist has way better powered water types than me with Manaphy,Kaledo and Tapu Fini to lead 3 psudeo-legends and i didn’t have any psudeo legends ten so i wanted to give Sharpedo cause her Carvanha was too fondled by Daisy(all laugh) and Sharpedo was there for 1 year during Johto under Daisy’s care(all laugh) so knew everything there but she said no i want Snorlax(all laugh) i said don’t get in a broing legal mess(all laugh) then take Glalie to which Tony even then wholeheartedly agreed cause that’s a beautiful ghost(all laugh) his motto his ghosts are graeat protections and this idea is of course influenced by psycho cause Tony boy had real trouble approaching her all times(all laugh) and Glalie couldn’t be immediately used before the completion of 6 years(all laugh) but after getting Glalie Mist focused on Carvanha feeding Glalie to Daisy(all laugh) and Glalie was a double league champ so was bossing Daisy over(all laugh) and only used once or twice i can’t recall then had to be forsaken(all laugh)...but now if those 3 brats are separated then Goldy and Kyogre original(all laugh) and Sharpedo are extremely good with Tentacruel,Kaledo,Kingdra,etc as good as well but Goldy is a bit separated from them cause he’s in the middle(all laugh) anyway,then by the time Max was told by the philospher that the beginning is so radiant and so on(all laugh) so he later just before we part tells me,’um..so if a girl follows me and gives me roses each week(all burst into laughter)..does it mean she likes me(all burst into laughter)’ so he was brushed aside with the saying that absolutely when it’s the other way around(all laugh)..anyway so lets go back to my Sinnoh farewell with my Mist so before this the Battle Frontier was something but then all my sister-in-laws were there and was fun rather for 11 days(all laugh) and Mist wasn’t present the first day(all laugh) what a day that was with the trophy(all laugh) then after that Lillie took my side(all laugh) and Daisy the other(all laugh) cause one had to negate professionality and the other the humanity(all burst into laughter,Tracey and Daisy uncontrollably laugh) then Violet was in between waiting to jump(all laugh) cause it’s just so naive(all laugh) Mist came next day still says um..who came(all burst into laughter) Violet was over the moon cause that’s copybook new marriage shame(all burst into laughter) and Lillie wisely was gauging the situation and on 4th day came to my side(all laugh) and Daisy immediately thought that this is just the play of ego cause the human calls all times yet he can to only politely ask if all is well(all burst into laughter,Tracey and Daisy uncontrollbaly laugh)...then visitors room was forced upon me(all laugh) but Mist stayed the room beside(all laugh) which was so much fun as to family schism(all laugh) really those 8/9 days were so much fun but Mist went to Viridian also to personally apprise Brawn that no Cerulian didn’t get undue attention and advantage(all burst into laughter) Brawn now says well Misty got a Gyarados and was too good then the show erupted with her entry even that was good(all laugh) but then the troubles would be there even that is good kid just that laugh at someone’s or own cost that joy(all burst into laughter) but then Mr Oak Mr Oak tried to be professional yet something was pulling him there by the hair that came off(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs in tears laughing) and then the gentleman(all laugh) yeah it was understandable that he stayed there to help Misty but later most of time was out of service exactly when Misty wasn’t in show but her sisters were that is Daisy i understood(all burst into laughter) but even that was well cause Ah kid that open hearted laugh with and among friends the activities together with friends,the pranks and the blushes to increase that fun(all burst into laughter) but then they didn’t like electric types(all laugh) and those two young men were so naive(all burst into laughter) but that Frucient gym stuff your wife didn’t handle rightly cause it was a matter of threats(all laugh) surely Crawdauntogator was too well known for you to not lend them to your starter lab comrades to help your former beau to subtly showing her and the whole world that you couldn’t be replaced(all laugh) and you know those two were laughing at Team Rocket what are you going to do to us anything but just to press/that panick button no matter how strong can’t get us to ever compress/what will pokemons do to us as we’ve beaten the flower being from the very water cress/and snatched her beau away to us to redefine the definiton of the bachelor’s mess(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter)...so are the non-bachelor’s mess alive...”
Lillie(fits of laugh) : “only by pulling hairs(all burst into even more laughter)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “and still the men were professionaly gentle so naive(all burst into laughter)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “and patronizing(all burst into laughter)..”
Violet(laugh) : “man this is brutal stuff(all laugh)..thank God i was out(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “well i was later asked too sweet isn’t it(all laugh) i said yeah that age(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “and i was told you see this Cerulian gym what is it about this place that two men of such high calibre and infatuated with(all laugh) the sisters i understand are uniquely talented but they are having all the fun themselves where’s the reply(all burst into laughter) later during Frucient said nah too much pestering and yet won’t use ghosts(all laugh) little girls these days told her use Crawdauntogator to threaten the brat will himself forget the word gym(all laugh) said i guess i could but so far away(all burst into laughter) i realized it’s the in between negotiations stuff so not funny at all thus i didn’t feel right(all laugh) later after he was told about the marriage and all said yeah too far to be single(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well,other Gyms and all other trainers and etc knew everything about the two naive men(all laugh) and those who knew toffee-flower and saw Gyarados-flower knew the rest(all laugh) so i was never asked as to what i was doing there for a month(all laugh) but Mr Slate ever got me saying Ash tell those two to confess else will erupt(all laugh) i said the other way around in similar situation stagnation till eruption just wish my future is trouble free(all laugh) but about Brock none of them clearly knew cause he was naive(all laugh) and Violet couldn’t be approached on personal matters by anyone except her sisters due to expression of freedom(all laugh) so they were safe thus the endeavours(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “well we stayed away from each other for 9 years as well(all laugh) physically(all laugh) and hence the trouble(all laugh) then Brock comes to Viridian and i felt uncomfortable in expressions(all laugh) then Lil was scripting and me most times here(all laugh) feeding Dase or Mist there(all laugh) but our Mist flower was unhappy with Unovan covers(all laugh) then later the show was off so i get to do the solos and then Brock comes around finally being directed to(all laugh) and then i finally stayed at the greatest husband position(all laugh) then the family is involved to my utmost apprehension(all laugh) but then i realized that it’s just so naive(all laugh) but still these antics are no sane person would do except non-person Gengars(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well you two were most honoured as in feelings(all laugh) so this and the other cutomers here at lab say man you people run monopoly(all laugh) i said well if i chose other labs still had to come here none can tolerate Muk(all laugh) said yeah and that pest can’t breed either will laugh out of here as well(all laugh) i said yeah pretty much his understanding of his life and then you know the professional gentelmen(all laugh) said yeah all of them are so innocent(all burst into laughter,Brock laughs shaking his head and Violet uncontrollably laughs) and now with Saul and Dave being here it’s all naive for sure(all laugh) anyway,back to Sinnoh break end,unlike Frontier break this time after 4 years infact since the day of confession Mist cried a lot bidding me farewell to which i also had tears in my eyes cause i didn’t want to leave her for 2 years or Unova being hard i planned two more months so 2 years and 4 months and that too in Unova,not much connection and now Brock wasn’t there either so that I could be so assured and Mist too will be informed as to my whereabouts..we just had a hard time bidding farewell and i just managed her after may be 20 minutes of so just at the main exit itself and repeatedly telling her this is my last journey before marriage for sure..Brock parted after like 12 years and the year in between Trace was no different to him ever the brother-fox(all laugh) but i had to be more responsible and carefull now and that too in Unova of which more people didn’t know much except the dragons and that it was the hardest region but you know i still thank God that it was Unova and not Kalos that i chose cause things would’ve been way harder then(all laugh)..TYRAniTAR(all laugh)..and then i get another former Gym leader turned dragon breeder but that’s just Cili(all laugh)..Cili(all laugh)..Cili’s greeting is,’um..wehenever you call i feel so happy i mean um...Cili..Cili..(all burst into laughter)’ then Cili eventually would say be professional(all laugh)..i see Cili professional,sweet sweet Cili(all laugh) have you started a new competition(all laugh) then Cili eventually will say just give up those ghosts(all laugh) then would come huh your Ketchumed up lesser ‘mam shows me professionality now being AWAY from me in the gym Cili away away away from me(all laugh) then Cili would lecture respect her(all burst into laughter)..i see Cili fans respect my triflest part(all laugh) but Cili a even telecasted match comes with visual imparities(all burst into laughter)..then Cili would say yeah your wish is that you’ll run a lunatic dark gym with who can fool around for 24 hours and a second more per day badge(all laugh) and now ‘mam has to referee that to see YOUR skills(all burst into laughter)...but Cili my Cascade badge wasn’t the hall of fame one(all laugh)..then Cili will eventually start the professionality himself(all laugh)..and with ‘mam once a week will have a few talks in details(all laugh) which is mandatory cause wants to know my endeavours(all laugh) and details is more cause of Palkia and Kyurem cause ‘mam is fed those two brats mostly(all laugh) one opines that 2nd master could be you(all laugh) i said do you understand that you are my soulmate(all laugh) is that my new name(all laugh) substandard(all laugh) cause that’s idiotic are your type soulmate(all laugh) then the other says 2nd master in futility tries to know you(all burst into laughter) i said she is my soulmate is that her beau’s type(all laugh)..Dave of course battled Mist for 32 minutes(all laugh) now says yeah then she wasn’t well but still so nice personlaity but the stories we know now did you influence her to calm down(all burst into laughter)..i said no without the gentleness none can manage a mad Gyarados all alone at 22 after 3/4 months at a gym(all laugh) then Dave laughed and said too much bonhomie(all laugh)..no Cili was and  a very ture close friend and he is a true good guy to the utmost core as you know and now like Harris and all with similar relation after all but i just like to get after him which he himself enjoyes too much(all laugh) and you know same age as me and had already finished 3 years of Gym training through Kalos and Unova and then was leader for one year then breeder training for three more years with the speciality then toured Unova again for 1.5 till and Orange and Kalos for another 1 each in between completed the 6 months to get the A dragon(all laugh) and still was gym leader for 2 more months on temporary basis(all laugh) and all these in total eight years was 28 when met me for his final travel across Unova to get a tag of speciality that has propelled him to a dictionary position on Unova to the whole world in the specific communities at the age of just 37(all laugh) and now he’s a real renouned figure with my dragons and all and too busy unless jane helps(all laugh) manages 30 gyms and 20 specialities(all laugh) and Jane same speciality so manages(all laugh) and Cress and Cathbert are extremely nice persons you know but were freaked out with my activites there(all laugh) so they were ever supportive of Cili and especially being youngest sibling and then in Unova the initial two months were fun really but Cili or Iris weren’t like Brock,Trace or May that i had like a blood relation with these 3 and the bond i have with Cili is like having having Kane with me which is as good as having a family cause he knows me inside out but Cili then weren’t that and that’s also why i never liked the word DESTINY if associeted with my family(all smile) cause Mist took 3 minutes to recognize me thus slapped her eternal hubby as i said ‘mam(all laugh)...right(all burst into laughter),Brock 10 minutes as the links of metaphyscial naivety(all laugh) didn’t even speak before match except 5 customery minutes and then next 5 the badge was handed and already was speaking philosophically in that feeling(all laugh),Trace the same as the jackal was searching for 22 years throgh Kalosversities and contests finally to cunningly become a observer so that no matter where in or out of profession as i’ll be interested has to contact him thus to again get his prey(all laugh),May 20/25 that too cause she was 16 herself so didn’t exactly remember which pester-mothds works best(all laugh),Dave much olden age(all laugh) so was smooth but said will restart with future(all laugh) infact i met my little sis at 22 and my little bro at 31 so long gap(all laugh) and all except Brock was sudden,Dave was well never knew both of us who will be the partner at undercover and the round 1 at Unova was rather skirmish stuff(all laugh) then Mist is Mist got too irritated went to privacy(all laugh) and demanded me being there immediately(all laugh)..right(all burst into laughter),Trace rather found us almost unconscious after setting those 3 to jump upon us so that can use the sentiment as usual(all laugh) and then May too just stole a bike and simulated situations to pester me(all laugh) again those 3 helped her(all laugh) and the unsudden one is so cause all you need to do is to look at the MAN(all laugh) cause it was us who were sudden as naivety is too precious a dish(all laugh,Brock .ly laughs) and all my first 5 travels for 9 years i had my full family with me and you know getting a right travel companion from certain places gyms and other competitions and the first general meets and all so so hard and difficult and i had a family..i told Dave later whom you know(all laugh) each time one new says all were damn brats except the last in Kanto(all laugh) cause he was a 1 time champ 8 years younger(all laugh)..asked what about formalities everywhere(all laugh) said yeah too sweet till the battling part dawned(all laugh)..after 30 seconds(all laugh)..Zara says only because totally out of profession just the wills and all(all laugh) and then too had to be under the cover for the sentiment to grow(all laugh)..and Dave says don’t know you saw all JUST THAT TURNAROUND(all laugh) OF CHU(all laugh)..so this is also why my powers had developed cause without you i never had any personal relations cause of my nature and travels and most so cause i never needed to and even more and the reality is that that need itself you’ve created troubles for someone like me to may be abort my journey after first region so it was about first my soulmate and then Brock and the others i really was lucky that i found them earliest in life(all smile)..and those 3 i later told them the last time i spoke impersonally that you have helped me find my wife on the very first day of my professional career and i was 16 then and then Trace in a way and May for sure and Dave and my relation you know were all inside there(all laugh) really i have same realitions with you i guess as well in a opposite way(all laugh) and they were overjoyed too but yeah i’ve had my time with them as well in undercover when i did know that they did behave like my big brother and sister no matter what right inside the death’s den..so yeah frenemies for eternity indeed(all smile)..but wisdom has dawned upon them that their future must start with a Totodile then get a Corpish(all laugh)..anyway,so that was the thing really but in Sinnoh Dawn was same as Iris infact Iris was way better as a professional cause most of all she was a trainer herself and not in contests but Dawn was just a sweet little kid and we enjoyed a lot but in Sinnoh Brock was ever there so it was a bit strange to me in the beginning but i was most busy in my head as i said many times during Unova due to so many things and those initial months were fun but then a lots of things started to happen with my bunch and my ever growing intuitions and all,so enter the one and only playboy(all laugh) and this has many versions like Playboy Ketchum(all laugh),Playboy Master(all laughter),dreaded playboy,womanising playboy too manising beware(all laugh) and so on(all laugh) so Professor Oak sum up,confession-boy and young flower dream and also friend-boy and girlfriend-flower”
Gary(laugh) : “well after two words(all laugh)...confession boy went to Haunter all villeges at City nights(all laugh) seeing his Mist everywhere and battling too much while the young flower dream was all about being wifely-Ketchumed-again(all laugh)...thus they were ever together despite 5000 miles difference(all laugh) then friend-boy was much mautred despite loose motions(all burst into laughter) and ultimately did become a pokemon master but that day neither me nor Trace could be present and later 6 days later i came Trace was 4 days late then we had a good time when the friend-boy came here in Pallet but just for 4 days again(all laugh)and then again the friend-boy came after passing 3 week honeymoon with wifed-again-girlfriend-flower(all laugh)...who again was all about the tempering the screen(all laugh)...so that’s about it...”
Ash(laugh) : “Trace how was my Marshadow(all laugh)..?”
Tracey(laugh) : “still is after me(all laugh)..tells me why my hair is of this length(all burst into laughter)...but Marshadow was again set upon me who pestered me to death for 4 days and when i told him to settle down i was told to concentrate on the days(all laugh)...but i also did see his hesitation but it was ok and again wasn’t here for more than 4 days and we all knew as he did that his bunch needed him most then and then Ash told me to look after Misty when i’m around and still asked me about pests and all i ever said don’t bother things come as you know and it’s just ok,we’re all there with her and all but also i guess that girlfriend-flower was a huge friend to us all cause what she really did and then also the next 6 months or so..just that was Misty’s best in her career and was prized as the special distinction gym..so a bit about that too and what i got was her calmness and gentleness and all in all situations and that was inspiring to me with her skills to assist it...”
Daisy(smile) : “yeah that’s for sure Mist did inspire me as well with all those characteristics and form it was just that i finally had my baby sis beside me who was so good all around that i really felt like my mom and dad was back(all smile)..and i could again just be myself and that is just the most common girl living her life and the responsibilities and all really was hindering me and to me Mist was like that then and still i see her still feel like that with her character but then again(all laugh)...her eloquent part is something from another dimension(all laugh)..and actually the way Mist would appear to you is the exact opposite to the herd of Ghostradarkarrigussonor(all laugh)...as it is Gengleye is Gengleye(all laugh)...but how much is Mist herself spoiled now(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well my flower is trying her hands at aged wife stuff(all laugh)..now i’m not present during the break before she restarts almost sobbs to me in phone(all laugh),’hum..Ash..37 too old hum(all laugh) showing me so much work(all laugh)’..which is why Gengleye are more important now(all laugh)...but again all are going to host a dragon of a Garchomp(all laugh)..don’t know what that brat will do here with poor Brauch(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “but i was immune to all changes(all laugh)...Mist only relieved my pressure(all laugh) and my no match thus no draw or loss record(all laugh)...ever intact(all laugh) cause next time if needed my Steelix naively would battle(all laugh)...but yeah Mist was a very textbook perfect lady as it seemed amd was approximating to that TILL Ghostradarkarrigussonor came around again to get himself dumped first and then suddenly appeared to abduct all(all laugh)”
Brock(laugh) : “well i became even more naive seeing and hearing about Misty’s behaviours with pests(all laugh)...still would ever be polite no matter how firm and not directly say namecalls(all laugh) or be eloquent(all laugh)...”
Lillie(smile) : “well Mist had the biggest impact on my life to be honest and made me responsible beyond measures and for that i’m ever so happy that she’s also my little baby sis as well as being like a role model in personal life and the shows together was the biggest ground of learning as well and because i was ever with her in those uncomfortable situations and saw her yearning for Ash i first believed that Ash aslo must be very strong charactered and wanted Mist a lot if not that much and actually both me and Gary will remian thankfull to Mist and Ash for making our path way easier but again eloquence is eloquence(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “we are mere servants of Lugias(all laugh)...”
Lillie(laugh) : “why are you so interested in nests Ketchum(all laugh)?...if you start those type specifications again(all laugh)...i’ll eloquent up as well(all laugh)...and keep those Ghosts away from my Gili(all laugh)...Darkramar is too interested(all laugh)..really you know,my Gili is seeing a Darkrai and a Malamar of all since birth almost(all laugh)..but Ketchum,beware of THE law(all laugh).. ”
Ash(laugh) : “only Professionally(all laugh)..anyway(all laugh),actually Brock became more firm during breaks(all laugh) but yeah Mist is Mist too sweet as Gyarados(all laugh)..right(all laugh),so yeah she did have a very inspiring effect on all EXCEPT a jackal(all laugh) no man Dr Tracey is Muked forever Skechit can’t be inspired at all(all laugh) actually it was Trace who inspired Mist flower most cause he was here when pests came and then during the clarifying misson(all laugh) and during the hard months he was constant grounding voice similar role he played by the days later(all laugh) and as i ever say Trace understand he doesn’t need any inspiration exactly why he searches for exactly that(all laugh) so this gentleman looking most sly fox(all laugh) said on our psychothrombonosis date(all laugh) that he was inspired and was immediately threatened by Scyther(all laugh) and the reason he doesn’t need inspiration is the same reason why Muk doesn’t(all burst into laughter) and he is still an INHUMAN(all burst into laughter) so you see jackals are born gentle looking as they are most cunning as a HUMAN fox being slyly wicked(all laugh) so that is all the identity you’re going to have ya dumb buffoon(all laugh)..and Gary is inspired by me in the form of Mr Oak Mr Oak(all laugh),so you see(all laugh)..Kommo-O(all laugh)..and Cili ever says cut this language(all burst into laughter)..so with good hearts and jovial mood may today’s conference end cause all of us have become naive(all burst into laughter)...bye,(all reciprocate and bye)....”
Misty(same pose,irritated) : “get the hell out of my room you namecalls(all laugh) and DON’T MINGLE WITH MY..SWEETLY(all laugh) VOMITTED HUBBY....(all laugh and burst into laughter and recirprocate)...”

...........................................................................................................................................
(7 days later,middle,18,W)

Gary(laugh) : “well nests are professionally checked(all laugh)...but yeah i was seeing all there and Ash ever contacted me for all reasons(all laugh) and i realized that may be Misty was doing too much but never really was sure or bothered about it my job was in reservation where Misty was ever the same and she was making my lioness to bark more politely(all laugh)...so i was happy too(all laugh)...but that quote truely did me one of the biggest favours really cause i saw some beautiful men as well(all laugh) not only in for the case that Ash mentioned..and was about to set all my 20 and may be Ash’s bunch certainly Donphan as well upon them(all laugh) but not just there in my professional life as well it was needed that i focus on that and not on beauty(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “surely Trace we all must become more aware of beauty next time(all laugh)...but IT’S SO GLORIOUS(all laugh)...”
Tracey(laugh) : “that’s for sure but next time i’ll travel in more regions with you(all laugh)...and definitely Kalos(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “all of you infact most welcome(all smile)..especially in Kalos(all laugh)..and Orange with Magmorters(all laugh)..well Unova and Kalos and Sinnoh as well i just know all about them(all laugh) and Kalos the full region almost cause i wet to chosen places(all laugh) and at universities and all was a different experience but then again Unova(all laugh) and Sinnoh well that’s forgotten after the last two but i has 153 gyms there with 153 hall of fame and Yveltal(all laugh) and Spiritomb yeah(all laugh) and Rotom of course with Samurott(all laugh),MANTINE(all laugh)..anyway,so i then go to Unova and all things happen to me and all,then you know that part well as well as Kalos and Undercover the demonboy sections(all laugh)...so what was happening to confused flower(all laugh)...”
Daisy(laugh) : “had an illusion that you were more interested about Misty flower(all laugh)...the pests and the responsibility factor was just too much and as those newes kept coming all were dark to her and i certainly never believed in you then and Lillie was rather your supporter saying if you didn’t want Mist of all with her name etc why go for anyone else but in the last months she also was very angry with you and Viol was ever that biggest infatuation or greatest husband(all laugh)..so now it was the former(all laugh)...Trace never knew what to do cause he as ever is so connected to all of us just didn’t know which would hurt us which not if he did something and only ever said to wait and you would definitely comeback and all is well same as he told you to contact more and all...”
Brock(laugh) : “well i was of all Hydreigoned with him to Viridian lake for being naive then(all laugh)..and yeah went to Viridian that spot in like 3 minutes on a Hydreigon(all laugh)..thank God Misty was there though was of no help cause she almost died out of laughter(all laugh)...i by myself had to say how vultures flew from Cerulian to Cerulian in a circle(all burst into laughter) to create enough gust(all burst into laughter) so that the bee and the flower had and illusion that they don’t need to hold their hands more tightly to again break them(all laugh) and this inference was mouthed off saying this means it’s a DESTINY(all laugh) that it will happen again and again with any random sample(all laugh) so finally had to say the soulmate theory myself(all laugh) but before that yeah i wasn’t sure and confused too with all those newses and as i said after so much maturity in Sinnoh did feel strange and all surely...yeah in Viridian lake i was threatened to have dinner with them(all laugh)..cooked by Ash(all laugh)...which are ideas of me and Cilan the most(all laugh) and it is that it’s ever too nutricious for a date(all burst into laughter)...yeah the loose motion as well(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “well 4 years is a long time(all laugh) but never be naive(all laugh)...by the way Brock it’s a shame that you traded my Hoenn trophy with Steelix(all laugh)...Foster will follow suit unless you control the naivety(all laugh)...”
Brock(laugh) : “philosophically(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “metaphyscially in universality(all laugh)...anyway,then finally Unova final ends,by the way did anyone see Unova final,i know all didn’t except Trace the last two rounds hiding himself at night(all laugh) but never asked the professor and also professor WHY DID PROFESSOR DR GARY OAK NEVER TRAVELLED WITH ME AND NOT AGAINST(all burst into laughter)..?”
Gary(laugh) : “well the second is cause of two-worded imbalanced density(all burst into laughter)...no really if we travelled in say Unova(all burst into laughter)...that would’ve been something(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well the pests would’ve been taught about type specifications of anatomical parts(all burst into laughter)..AH! BEAUTY,BEAUTY(all laugh)..how was the Unova final professor?”
Gary(laugh) : “ too specified(all laugh)...well i had the misfortune of seeing Ashey-boy in TV and not in opposite end(all laugh) and then i never watched with grandpa cause he had poisonous company(all laugh)..so i watched the full 32 minutes(all laugh)..each took around 3 and each were psudeo legends(all laugh)...against Munro Blasie,7 league champion again(all laugh) and again you now know who he is(all laugh)...this only he lost then went to become hall of fame at 5-2...and yeah from Unova himself(all laugh)...then 34 again married to a 1 time champion,Rene Blasie from Johto who won the Sinnoh league of all(all laugh)..Ash your bit..”
Ash(smile) : “ Mr Munro Blasie,Pokemon Master,Hall of Fame abolutely all on his own like Nigel and Nancy and so many others,7 leagues,5-2,from Urnumham,Unova,starter Litten,first region-Orange-win,second-Kanto-win,3rd-Johto-win...here he met Rene on her second Journey after Kanto,then took her to Hoenn then parted later married,4th-Hoenn-win,5th-Sinnoh-win,6th Unova Frontier-win,7th Kalos-win,after this married then finally Unova...the last match under a cap(all laugh)...at undercover had to get that off with very short hairs(all laugh)..then you know the locks were back in Kalos later to fuel the press and enjoy the chewing(all laugh) but then ever locked hairs got very short again after that brat pulled her tricks at Kalos(all laugh)...that was to rile people up even more(all laugh)..and i’ll tell you later the plight of beautiful men there cause those men along with their women(all laugh) are too fond of me and pesters me for 5 minutes once a month atleast(all laugh) asking for how to work at offices(all burst into laughter) and the women discusses on emotional management(all uncontrollably laugh) well the other men has to keep in touch so they anyhow do(all laugh) and Misty ‘mam is a dangerous specis of Gyarados now(all laugh)..right(all burst into laughter),so i’m contacted each time by these other men of beauty and their women beakes my head off for 4/5 minutes asking about all sorts of things on 5 minute matches on grass in preparing them illegally by means of home decoration(all burst into laughter)..i ever say attack yourselves(all laugh)..yeah i get retuns as well some men tell me everything about what happens in conferences(all laugh) some tell me about home decorations of course(all laugh) some increased my knowledge on type specifications on grass and the others on each molecule of illegal substances(all laugh) but some men tell me about how to write official reports in mild language with emotion(all laugh) as i do the opposite(all laugh) and finally their soulmates tell me how emotion must be managed while at home(all burst into laughter)...but before anything may i tell why some most beautiful men suddenly are so much after me(all laugh) well some men went at Unova to cut my throat(all laugh) they did what they did but the battle comes up between six 6 time champs and 6 time champ(all laugh) now the logic is if you’re emotional you win one league great amusing abolute but the logic that first any buffoon would fight you in Unova Elite4 HQ of all dragons(all laugh) for a human prize being discretely made public to him cause first thing is that he doesn’t have to fight to beat you just a wink of an eye so you get your license off with being internationally defamed then shown to the whole world for the next two months where are your emotions then it’s cold logic(all laugh) then secondly you will get utterly humiliated cause he may cheat on you using the same Elite4 so you get again defamed and in public which will again kill your emotions then secondly why he will accept it is only because of your emotions cause all at 6+ level know that emotions in opponent means you’ve won already without any pokemons(all laugh) and thus they will use normal pokemons to your best then when you’re weak will totally kill you by releasing a Giratina or an Ultranercozma(all laugh) then thirdly the trouble is that you’re after someone whoose bunch showed a power the match of which isn’t found in last may be 2000 years(all laugh) and that was 3 years back(all laugh) and now his bunch forces his opposition like Thundurus to return by himself to pokeball without one attack(all laugh) so you being emotional can get the insinuation that the very name legendary pokemon is exactly what his bunch is expecting in triple their numbers may be to battle properly(all laugh) so anyhow the men say lets go to a water gym facility and then teachs me of all people about water types saying i lost certain cups(all laugh) i was laughing in my head that mates cups i understand and yes it is universally know that i’m weakest with water types cause i didn’t use many ever but i’ve 14(all laugh) but let competitions go i admit i’m no good but have you managed two water types one without any natural psychic powers in a  ground surface against 10 electrics including illegals out of which 2 were Thundurus 2 Tapu Kolo 2 Zekrom(all laugh) all swelled up max elovoluted at the face of sure death to you as well AND more importantly first you came out totally unscathed(all laugh) and your same enemies wholeheartedly helpd you in that endeavours(all laugh) so surely i know a few things atleast about water types like a mere Feraligator(all laugh) who stood for 1 hour in that situation giving all sorts of plans to the world that will kill him(all laugh) and came out fresher than start(all laugh) and fooled around with the rescuers(all laugh) with another Crawdaunt to distribute each plan to the opponents to help them in the killing process(all laugh) and then both asked them if they can understand each distributinon of the mental and physical changes as they dance(all laugh) so surely i know about those two but that is reserved only for real opponents like greatest boss(all laugh) well the men wanted Crawdauntogator(all laugh) i said i can beat you people each time this week with a Metapod(all laugh) so then we reach there they say 1 on one i say 200 on one if you people can(all laugh) i choose you my soulmate Tauros(all burst into laughter) yeah soulmate was used to poke the men even more cause i was enjoying the emotional plight(all laugh) and then a Tauros(all laugh) who can’t move an inch from the standing position on the platform(all laugh) very incesed were the men they choose uses the same word soulmate(all laugh) and infact to my utmost delight they fondle each pokeball(all laugh)...right(all smile),and whisper something..right(all smile) and then think i’m the one being deluded...right(all smile and .),so this i was absolutely laughing at in my head and i just decided that i’ll faint you people as well right into the pool as my Tauros befriends you brats or they may themselves kill you people for catching them to begin with cause after Kalos brat i was not in this plane but total psychic plane and my whole blast of joviality was that that i don’t care here cause i don’t live here so no matter which legend in alone would’ve turned on even the greatest boss if i didn’t even use any pokemons at all(all laugh) so anyway out come Kyogre at primal 4,so now they tell her to attack full by dismantling the platform from psychic barriers,so they change i was laughing cause Tauros knows what the men are upto more than they will ever come up with certainly in next 1000 years(all laugh) so just as Kyogre reach that platform behind the psychic wall but has to physically appear Tauros of all pokemons knows where and when Kyogre will become in physical form more than the brat himself(all laugh) cause TYRAniTAR(all laugh) so Tauros goes, are you yourself hungry or is it actually your master(all laugh) that’s it no more words nothing(all laugh) cause Kyogre is a psudeo legend only but sadly isn’t Fafstasfodustom(all laugh) who if were told that line would’ve instantly killed off Tauros(all laugh) so Kyogre immediately stops,now as soon as Kyogre stop i say that my brat told you people’s brat how many beaus how many beaus bring each brat together i’m hungry(all laugh) so the men gets absolutely incensed and tell Kyogre to attack more only to prove further who is what(all laugh) so now the men emtpties the whole legion(laugh) out comes, Greninja,Mantine and Mega Gyarados-red dark at 5(laugh,all laugh and .)-one at platform,one sky one normal water so the referee says what is it i say longing for beau(laugh) the men by then have calmed down(all laugh) realized a 2000 such pokemons cann’t do a thing so now want to use brains(all laugh) go on telling me that honesty is a great virtue i add unless unethical(all laugh) then they show the cool nature to get Kyogre back which doesn’t work no matter what they do Kyogre won’t move till told who the masters are(all laugh) and i have to do that the masters can’t(all laugh) but masters could if i had a water or strenght type hence Tauros(all laugh and .) to legends this trick won’t work UNLESS my Taurose is ALONE(all laugh) cause they’ll detect it in me like Xormnuh(all laugh) was trying to detect why Goodra is BROUGHT on an island(all laugh) got that i’m my Goodra too(all laugh) didn’t get any clue what-so-ever on how i’m separate from Goodra(laugh,all smile) so depite my different form realized that i don’t exist cause i’m my Goodra i can’t harm him at all so budged.Ghostradarkarrigussonor would’ve asked me why all your signals aren’t like Goodra(laugh) to which the answer is you’re wrongly counting 2 different Goodras in one like when a new pokemon is born he can’t immediately get all signals of his parent or parents so doesn’t understand different moods but knows the parent is same so obeys like when you’re angry and not your signals are different so if you meet another Ghostradarkarrigussonor and know he is angry or not do you say the same Ghostradarkarrigussonor is two cause he was angry and now not thus you’re making a mistake trying to count two Goodras in one we’re different Goodras have a look don’t count us together we’re two separate Goodras isn’t it so(all laugh and .) that would be it(all laugh) he can’t read human emotions so eventually if i say i’m 1000 different Goodras have to budge(all laugh) so the first requires being the same Goodra the second is being 1000 different Goordas(all laugh) so previously i was my Goodra and no such thing as Ash though i looked different so i couldn’t harm them now it is i’m not eaxactly my Goodra but in general terms i’m a Goodra herd(all laugh) so though i look one and so i’m just one among many Goodras so Ash is not(all laugh and .)but the third will say BUT YOU ARE ONE AND DIFFERENT FROM ALL POKEMONS SO I CAN KILL YOU WHO ARE YOU ACTUALLY TELL ME THAT I MUST KNOW so answer is forget Goodra and another 1000 Goodras just look at me i’m you actually(laugh) that’s that i have to be in general terms a pokemon with human emotions mixed there none can detect which exact pokemon i am and because of the general term used everyone will believe that i’m them if i persist as hypnotising them and concentrating on their very own signals and reflect that with my knowledge of being a pokemon that’s saying now forget all craps as an individual look at me i’m the whole specis of pokemons(all smile) so you pick me as yourself(all laugh and .) some may still go to fourth and insinuate(all laugh) BUT YOU ARE ONE,aren’t you too one separate yet a pokemon in reality(all laugh) so now i’m an indivual of pokemons i can be not my opponent but he must admit that i’m still a pokemon(all laugh) then they will make the mistake saying but you’re not pokemon cause you can’t attack and all which is how are you talking with me then(all laugh) so they have to admit that i have same psychic strenght as a pokemon thus one pokemon among the legendaries that they don’t know yet(all laugh) then they’ll say but we don’t know you..mind the Palkia trick(all smile) but we can be you,Butterfree trick(all laugh and .) and will repeat my own bunch’s trick on me and so on(all laugh) and then i’ll say what do you want they will say want to know you i say how you know each other of the same type but not in your group or different type cause we play so then play,end(all laugh and . and cheer) now in my actual human form still to them it’s the same if my attitude to them is so being honest to myself and thus any legend would play with me but being in my bunch their choise always and if someone like me tries this on my bunch because they are my bunch and this is also my own method the other person you understand have to be so honest to himself thus like Lance or Professor but yet my bunch won’t defect to them cause they can’t differentiate in between and defecting means deceit or i lack something so if your bunch can do the same just a big family(all smile) so this is generally what i do as a pokemon-human and i eat my sweet tiffin when human-human(all smile)...right(all smile),the tiffin would say that i’m me and not me means in different version i want me as you but i like my Ash(all laugh) but remember Mist tiffin don’t try to hold traditions there(all burst into laughter)...right(all laugh),yeah in the beginning Sableye wanted me to lick them(all burst into laughter) i did in Kalos(all laugh) and was in hospital for 6 days(all laugh) then they realized it(all laugh) what a bunch(all laugh)..after hospital next 6 days 4 gyms(all laugh)..so similar result in different ways but a jackal is there(all laugh)..what’s your legend taming trick Mr jackal(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “AH!HUMAN!HUMAN!(all burst into laughter)”
Ash(laugh) : “humanmon is only good for your own Daisylmon(all laugh)”
Daisy(laugh) : “my trick is to sentimentally ask the legend about their beaus what do they do what do they do(all burst into laughter)”
Ash(laugh) : “FOXING(all burst into laughter,Tracey .ly laughs,Daisy uncontrollbaly laugh) anyway,Professor..”
Gary(laugh) : “you..me(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “only if practised on umpteenth and the one huge herd of wild Tyranitars(all laugh),Lillie wig(all laugh)”
Lillie(laugh) : “you are me and i ‘m you but but you don’t like me(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “wiggedly Garyed(all laugh),most honoured Violet sis please your opinion..”
Violet(laugh) : “the expression of biased freedom(all burst into laughter and .)”
Ash(laugh) : “perfect artistry(all laugh)..but finally(all laugh) i know this answer so the last so crook..(all laugh)”
Brock(laugh) : “all your tricks no good as all you’re doing is to STRIVE(all burst into laughter)/striving for me won’t fetch me legend cause i’m already so NAIVE(all uncontrollably laugh,Violet in tears laughing)”
Ash(laugh) : “well Mr Oak has got naive(all uncontrollbaly laugh,Gary .ly laughs,Lillie in tears laughing and Brock too .ly laughs) but NO IT’S HUMAN(all laugh) no it’s just that memory you know(all laugh) we barely managed to get out of there(all laugh,Tracey .ly laughs) during the day Trace was made SO GLOURIOUS(all laugh) i was talking about next term and the brat was saying that yeah this and that i said to be humans only why so greedy(all burst into laughter),anyway first gym leader,that’s the most crooked insinuation(all burst into laughter) so definitely the best trick as usual,cheers for the crook(all laugh and cheer for Brock)..but crook’s medicine is the family(all burst into laughter)..cheers for the Boulder..”
Brock(laugh) : “just move on you brat(all burst into laughter and cheer for the Boulder)”
Ash(laugh) : “with naivety(all laugh) all one needs to do is to say that i’m pretty fine don’t want to drink another sip of water(all burst into laughter) Mist told Mrs Slate about Chu threatening Tlplocus said could’ve given you Mantine(all laugh) Mist is ok with electric types always not just cause of me(all laugh) but Mrs Slate is ok with grass types cause they can be managed but electric is most loathed(all laugh) told me that could’nt you get a bonus starter(all laugh) and thank god one daughter in law in out of profession two are watered(all laugh) and the son-in-law better be cautious if applies and isn’t cause he’ll be alone(all laugh) so,anyway,so all knows that to move my Tauros from there they have to use an attack but before they do Tauros will create a quake with two front foots which will send the whole water to flood out and then the ground is leveled and you can’t beat him there cause you can’t match his agility and the duplicates he’ll create to hallucinate you(all laugh) thus your psychics wont work you must become visible when he will bull chage you to 1 month pokecentre if he is being gentle(all laugh) so those 3 come out a Mantine a red Mega Gyarados and a Greninja(all laugh) so they get at Tauros and the trouble for the men is that unless they tell them to attack they won’t and when they do Kyogre himself will tell the disguise(all laugh and .) exactly what happens(all laugh) so Kyogre and the rest just calmly stays, so now the men say you’re better than us but you’re not good person and you this and that insinuating all stuffs of faith(laugh) so then i say whatever but your beloved beaus is coming to me now(all laugh and .) and call Kyogre to me first who happily oblidges(all laugh) i pat him extremely well shaped pokemon no wonder a 3 time champ absolutely was,so then the men sit down as the rest including Gyarados follow suit(all laugh) i say now your beaus are rejecting you so all 4 charges at the men to their shock then fondles them to death(all laugh) so then after 5 minutes Tauros says i’m hungry not thirsty(all laugh) i tell him then shut up(all laugh) then recall him go to the other side ref was there didn’t understand a thing but knew me as everyone does in Unova and Kalos and now Sinnoh too if not before(all laugh) and then i’m the winner cause the opponents forgot to learnt things in their lessons that you people can’t push your mates to death while you people enjoy thus the men instantly says that’s it i say just next moment confessing?(all burst into laughter) privately(all burst into laughter and .) then privacy is taken to now beside me after full half an hour appears Giratina and Hoopa(all laugh) realeased excuing bathroom as usual(all laugh) and Chu was kept at home with Gengleye(all laugh) so then seeing the two psudeo-legendary ghosts right from Unova the men becomes ardent followers(all laugh) so then say whatever they say then i say change the names cause they will be after you people(all laugh) and as soon as the trouble dilutes just a bit you realize or i tell you immediately flee the whole Kalos-Unova region next flight home and you’ll get a seat i’ll arrange that today itself and don’t try to see my match against the head here your license is done then and so stay mumb at your hotel but don’t flee without telling me cause then you’ll be caught at airport(all laugh) which is general govornment and none of us can do much there so the men return and i ever wanted to say the predictions like when the jackal cried(all laugh) no really man that day Scyther was incensed(all laugh)...so the men wakes up to reality and then and there shows the real men by saying going to Orange i say perfect but can you people tell me why i didn’t win Johto and Kanto then your plane fair would’ve been saved(all laugh and .) then they are rather ashamed(all laugh) to which i say the answer is that i was living in reality not in the dreamworld(all laugh) they instantly realized what it means and i didn’t have the other implications at all cause by then my past was erased in my mind and why i can say this is that that past and my everpresnt universally we all know isn’t same at all so then men say whatever they say but later was far worse cause i was readmitted to schools(all laugh) then the press is chided saying they were after people’s personal life cause they by chasing others might’ve missed something all the press flew off(all laugh) and the Unova Elite4 says whoose your beau(all laugh) i say let them go i won the match yesterday i’m going as well tomorrow in different direction so i myself cant see off(all laugh) then the men enters the gym to give a piece of mind(all laugh) which created more trouble actually(all laugh) then after the men goes off i go to Sinnoh i read in between lines which was my worst day here and finally turn on vultures(all laugh) yeah from that point on Vultures became reality so they were everywhere(all laugh) in Sinooh Elite4 each were told in international press to give thoughts on the age related issues(all burst into laughter) meant i’m depressed playboy cause i was expecting only the young flower dream(all burst into laughter) yeah if ever then forever only my sweet Mist flower dream’s boy(all smile)...right(all laugh),if not said then you’ll be mouthed(all laugh)..fine(all laugh),in Hoenn Elite4 each line they told me was read in between the meanings(all burst into laughter) while Hoopa was there with me invisible reminding me neither me nor the chosen brats are doing so(all burst into laughter) thus i became very incensed with the playboy image meaning i definitely am a playboy thus after 5 years of VIGIL(all laugh) they have finally hit the bulls-eye(all laugh) cause that behaviour means my girlfriend singular or plural are upset with my personal life WITHOUT them(all laugh) so now that anger i’m showing on press so they’re VICTORIOUS(all laugh)...now in Kalos each were instructed to follow Buzzwole(all laugh) but i reformed it by saying eat just-sleep wake-up repeat(all laugh) JUST was enough by all meanings(all laugh) that being in Kalos totally decimated the brats cause that is their eventual base that they don’t want to recognize(all laugh) but i was telling them to thus i’m even in Kalos the worst playboy cause i was only lulling,CUNNINGLY(all laugh) and if that desparate any came they were told to just sleep(all laugh) so CUNNING(all laugh) so you see even Kalos all brats think twice now(all laugh) plus you all know that special press differentiating between bro and beau(all laugh) Kalos brats flew off to all hells(all laugh) then in Johto everyone knew that AH,BEAUTY,BEAUTY(all laugh) defeats are so beautiful cause then wins are forgotten,wins too are beautiful cause defeats are forgotten,thus win lose beauty is there definitely all along,so why are you questioning me let’s go home singing this song(all burst into laughter) that is the insinuation that i’m a playboy cause i tell them by using the last line and saying the words LET’S GO HOME that defeats and wins mean miss and hit(all burst into laughter and .) so i was a 4 region playboy champion(all laugh) now Orange was personal to me as i said so many memories of Mist and we were at that transitioning phase of teenage to youth and all so yeah a factor there and all so in Orange it’s said plus after those Kalos brats whole family jumped me there at Danny’s gym of all gyms(all laugh) AND WASTED MY 2 HOURS(all laugh) i was incensed and then later i appologised to Danny personally immediately next day there saying some memories aren’t fond just lost my mind i’m sorry if i ever became too egotistical to forget a gym leader without whoose affection that the word regarding our age difference that helped me in my career then Danny says just alright but says long time(all laugh) i jovially laugh(all burst into laughter) say no that one ages ago went after 1 year too long the distanced contacts too demanding(all laugh)...right(all laugh),(Ash hugs Misty quickly and smiles at her Misty smiles at Ash then both same pose)(laugh) just my flower doesn’t leave me at all once home(all smile),anyway,now Danny boy is a bit concerned(all laugh) so i say please we were 18 then(all laugh) it’s been another 17 and worlds apart Ms Waterflower is doing well in the gym great news no more is there to be read and neither you nor me are persons having remote interests in those i’ve got 107 you’ve got 1070 to look after(all laugh) now i add and my someone(all laugh) this confirms that the someone isn’t a Ms Waterflower(all laugh)...fine(all laugh),gym restarted and i’m not at the closing hours or during breaks so back to the lake(laugh,all smile and pat Misty)...right(all smile),and that someone might be from Orange had a skirmish not fond(all laugh)..so in Orange i said with Chu in ters of Tauros(all laugh),this earth,this sun/this match,too slowly to be done(all laugh)/this day,why it’s ney(all laugh)/thus we may say,that let’s not stay(all burst into laughter)/this battle,next one thought/i’m hungry,who have you brought(all laugh)/this hunger,ever on top/please tell me,never to stop(all laugh and .)..the art of battle starvation(all laugh and . and cheer for Chu)..that i’m battle hungry now that my formal career is in penultimate stop so now i was a failed playboy(all burst into laughter) so anyway Orange goes now the final stop the most beloved very own Kanto Region(all laugh) i didn’t want to do it cause that was last and own region and i was already 6-0 up so could’ve skipped just the tour at my leisure but Lance forced me(all laugh) i said i don’t want to antagonize people at own place simple(all laugh) Lance said that’s exactly what they need(all laugh) so i said ok but i have too much respect for you it’s hard they will write a loss or a no match against your name which will humiliate me to the extreme,Lance laughed saying then through 2 months only the ref will be a playboy(all laugh) i said happily agreed(all laugh) so you all know what i was doing in Kanto(all laugh) Lance called Persy saying you’re alone for 15 years need company(all laugh) and Persy said only if the antics are good enough whole 2 months for the referee to bust and thus a food(all laugh) chose the most grave one for 2nd round my choise was Giraora(all burst into laughter) Mr Ref Mr Ref what are you doing/oh Mr Ref tell us what is a pokemon not knoing which we’re rueing(all laugh)/Mr Ref Mr Ref why are you so sad/but now you’re sighing too why is it all so bad(all burst into laughter) Lance was laughing so much with this the ref said behave them(all laugh) so we behaved by hallucinating the side effects of seriousness(all burst into laughter) Giti showed a hallucination of many refs(all laugh) and each time serious Giti scoffed his jovial beau away they were happy(all burst into laughter and .) but as soon as Giti’s jumped on his serious beau they were mad(all laugh and .) then Zeraora asked questions then ref became unhappy too so that means by being serious you can’t get a beau(all burst into laughter and .) the ref wisely noted that he is responsibe(all burst into laughter) to which i said yeah just age related issues(all burst into laughter) then he told Lance disrespecting tou too,Lance said yeah seriously(all burst into laughter) so finally the ref said what do you want(all laugh) we said just enjoy then he realized what damn brats have entered(all laugh)..just the first round that was meaningfull the rest was that(all laugh) each a no contest and the first was because starter vs starter so Chu used 1 thunder chair against Jolteon’s one(all laugh) and well i want to describe a bit it the first round is one on one starters not mandatory just that day we decided as Lance asked me who’s still most serious(all laugh) cause we need the VEIL(all laugh) only to him i spoke the truth(all laugh) so 1st round one on one on same types like electric vs electric,2nd 2 on 2 of choise but not Sharpedo vs Goodra(all laugh),3rd same type double,4th  three on three of choise and 5th also of choise but must be opposites like rock-water-fire(all laugh) mixed(all laugh),6th two on two advantage disadvantage mixed on choise,7th psudeo-legend handicap 2 on 1(all laugh) this none won against Lance(all laugh) and we well(all laugh) was with Zekrom(all burst into laughter) a triangle(all laugh) the two came first word how am i less perfect than your beaus(all burst into laughter) finally they say beause must be strong cries her head off you won’t protect me(all burst into laughter) so anyway(all laugh) what a brat that is(all lugh),then 8th 5 on 5 all dragon(all laugh) and you MUST keep 5 atleast fresh for this(all laugh),9th one on one BUT PSUDEO-LEGEND VS NORMAL(all laugh) went with Heracross(all burst into laughter) saved that for Lance(all laugh) who said never laughed this much cause his Psudeo-legend was Tyranitar(all burst into laughter) then finally 10th  4 on 4 all ghost psychic(all laugh) where i had Gengleye,Beeheeyem and Dusknoir to pester the dignitaries section now(all laugh) Gengleye did the trick Beeheeyem told them forgot the last moment(all burst into laughter) and Dusky wisely noted that the exact point between two moments is never possible to know(all burst into laughter) and Lance chose Gengar,Darkrai,Deoxys and Banette(all laugh) and yes unless atleast 80 pokemons with 8 dragons and total 30 psychic and ghost combined with 10 psudeo-legends total one can’t get into Elite4 competitons unless 7+ victories(all laugh) basically the whole pokemon trainer’s journey is start-early get-depressed get-married settle-down nice life good bye(all laugh) cause in your first competition you can get a 7 time winner at 2nd round(all laugh) i got in 32nd (all laugh) and i had one Metagross to Sakura’s 13 psudeo-legends(all laugh) still says how did you win(all laugh) i said ask Metagross and Charizard(all laugh) who unfortunately was there(all laugh) she said why is one depressed as much the other is happy(all laugh) made me call Liza(all laugh) asked what preparation did you give except your girl(all laugh) Liza said just thought no girl was enough for him jumped into the ice(all laugh) Charla doesn’t like us(all laugh) first of course Snorlax then Feraligator was there then Crawdaunt(all laugh) then the triple ghosts(all laugh) then finally TYRAniTAR(all burst into laughter) Charizard was told where’s that brat where’s your mates with the mates(all burst into laughter) are your kids of the age to get illegals(all burst into laughter) bring each brat together(all burst into laughter) to which Charizard said have you failed in dating(all burst into laughter) which made made Tyranitar more incensed so he said a few chosen brats has fled(all burst into laughter) but now i’ll get the revenge on you(all burst into laughter) Charizard was monitored by me desperately saying girlfriendmon is Charla(all burst into laughter) so the brat knew that he can’t face all lunatics alone(all laugh) but did so cause it was done MENTALLY(all laugh)..and in breeding season Trace cautioned me(all laugh) i said how can i help i’ll get in more trouble(all laugh) then i just told them keep Madgaleo free(all laugh) and none wanted to breed then even the bugs except who were already chosen brats(all laugh) but that week break or so made them more incensed(all laugh) now that’s why i guess they say it’s not that there’s not another(all burst into laughter) utmost brats(all laugh) anyway then they were all too jovial(all laugh) then Noivern(all burst into laughter) all were alright but exactly then the last AH BEAUTY BEAUTY(all burst into laughter) that was it(all laugh) cause Charla is shrewd(all burst into laughter and .) on being questioned why not here Charizard told them politely never in a million years(all burst intto laughter,.)..right(all burst into laughter),the team rocket one was something(all laugh) and Trace was like who are these pokemons(all laugh),anyway this match pattern is same for all hall of famers that you must face but only the Elite4 head gets that 9th round speciality of 5 on 5 rest 4 on 4 but still dragons(all laugh) that’s all,so in the first month because i was after everything related to Kanto criticizing every little self imagined trouble(all laugh) and telling the refs to understand the emotions(all burst into laughter) so that during my matches they were jovial or extremely irritated and finished my 2nd gym on the day quickly so that i go to the third before the closing hours(all laugh) so i became extremely dangerous relationship and battle starved obsessive maniac playboy(all laugh) none came anywhere near me(all laugh) Sabrina phoned only(all burst into laughter) i said only incognito else the brats will force you to sleep at the forest(all laugh) said come after then(all laugh) and Giovanni,Ackjel and Blanie all were above 50(all laugh) Blanie was 65(all laugh) and Giovanni 64(all laugh) Blanie says 3 months to retire how about a playold(all laugh) i said feed them to the volcano(all laugh) then says direct type advantaged how long break-up(all laugh),13 or 14 can’t recall(all laugh)..right(all laugh),that was it didn’t ask much(all laugh)..but i know also what my sweetie said to Sabrina(all laugh)...right(all laugh),he doesn’t like me anymore(all laugh)...so(all laugh),Sabrina ever knew the real Gyaradosey sweet sweet flower(all laugh)...right(all laugh),anyway then Giovanni says,’see atleast Sabrina being my student only(all laugh) why don’t you battle me(all laugh)’ i said please you’re 30 years older to me she is 9(all laugh) much easier contact frequently(all laugh)..well i contacted Giovanni and Blanie once a month ever(all laugh) but each and each for 15 minutes(all laugh) cause whole world wants them once a month for an hour(all laugh)..then at night incognito went there with whole psychic bunch(all laugh) fooled around and all then he said nice picks(all laugh) but you know your former travel companion(all laugh),i said yeah but i did Kalos last(all laugh) then he laughs says why so much dissent(all laugh) crush(al laugh) then 15 years ago me 1 he 2 she she cheated on me how could she(all burst into laughter)...ok,ok(all laugh)..right(all laugh and burst into laughter)”
Misty(same pose,agitated) : “you namecalls enjoy this(all laugh)..Ash i won’t be a gym leader anymore from tomorrow let that crook manage with his volatile flower(all burst into laughter)...gym gym gym(all laugh,all cheer for young flower dream),SHUT UP(all laugh and cheer for Cascade)...Ash only you like me(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh,same pose) : “then i’ll abduct my namecall(all laugh)..sweet(all laugh) namecall(all burst into laughter)...right(all laugh)...anyway(all laugh),so then Giovanni says,yeah 4 year crush hard(all laugh) then i used the ultimate weapon(laugh) i say you surely know my antics in press(all laugh) in 15 years another 2 such but never liked stars(all laugh) so somehow managed(all laugh) then comes Ackgel at 58(all laugh) then just in hall of fame for 5 years i guess but again you know and with him too a bit more frequent 2/month contact(all laugh) he didn’t mention Mist in that way first at all cause he has taken lessons in humanity(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) just said your former travel compnaion now in hall of fame too still in contact(all laugh) i said no not for many years just happy to know was ever great with water types,now slowly the human comes out(all laugh) but your water types are galaxy famous(all burst into laughter)...by the way Blanie and Ackgel as like Giovanni only incognito at night fooled around in each place(all laugh) then my water types are galaxy famous(all laugh) i said held me back then using sentimental cards(all laugh)...right(all laugh) but your time is also coming Mist tiffin(all laugh)...so(all laugh),so that was it the thing was that it was fed to jealousy(all laugh)..anyway(all laugh),and these all were in final month and in the final month i finally jumped upon the final vulture the press itself(all laugh) i started saying do you knock the door or go direct(all laugh) people were extremely angry i said this exact anger is why you all are so private about your own personal lives yet think that a person having certain luck to have great pokemons can’t have that life this flattens them then i rile them up again(all laugh) but yeah the exposure is a big thing(all laugh) again they get angry so cool down(all laugh) but with less comes stability and self establishment,cools down(all laugh) again rile up but the range is so small(all laugh) again riled up then cool down the domain so deep in emotional control(all laugh) thus it went on and finally the day before my honour to have my last match against Lance i said today only pokemon what do you know of Hytostohurakanom(all laugh) that day they got the serious part so after Lance and that picture of Mist there then i went to Kalos for a certain Lugia to come around who pesters me each day now to tell him what a human is(all laugh) so now around the time i returned first to the lab and al before my match with Mist there i was the dreaded playboy(all laugh) so that’s full of Playboy Ketchum(all laugh)...right(all laugh),so then about the hair(all laugh),finally after my sweetie’s picture grew my hairs back(all laugh) otherwise Mist would’ve really fainted on that rounds day(all laugh)...anyway(all laugh),professor we’re no experts for sure on this matter(all burst into laughter)...”
Lillie(laugh) : “ever thought of baldening wigs(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “professionally(all laugh)..right(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “so Munro’s professional line-up(all laugh)..i remember cause Ash never battled after this(all laugh)..and each time Ash announced his order just after the last match(all burst into laughter) then volunteered to choose himself first no matter the toss(all laugh)..the authorities themselves by then were laughing cause they tried to test Tyranitar(all burst into laughter)..which report was shown to media with the threat that he still has a Solgaleo(all laugh)..all were legal just extremely powerful and you can’t hold a normal pokemon back from reaching legendary status at all and if you do you must announce that Ash is something more than just battling thus making the whole system meaningless(all laugh) cause you’re insinutating to catch legends and battle now(all laugh) and of course you can’t tell a 4 time champion to change profession(all laugh) and you can’t keep 60 legends anywhere without terminating them which required our permision(all laugh) and if we say did give then you know Tyranitar(all laugh) and even more devastatingly we can’t forget his bunch cause of their relation with us thus also emotially killing us forever(all laugh)...so Ash Ketchum played the whole system then to his favours(all laugh) and thus this announcement pleading for taking advantage over him(all burst into laughter)..Lance then told grandpa so jovilally saying this man can only be stopped by his wife(all burst into laughter)..and we know about that(all laugh)..the opposing line-up well you know the rules then(all laugh)..group stages each 10,then 12,14,16,20 and 20(all laugh) same in Kalos(all laugh) so Munro’s personally professional lineup(all laugh)->
Reshiram(all laugh)-where am i(all laugh),Rotom(all burst into laughter)-not the real(all laugh),Dialga(all burst into laughter)-am i so(all laugh),Latios(all laugh)-sky earth groud what’s the big deal(all laugh),Zekrom(all burst into laughter)-why me i..i.. cherish you so much(all burst into laughter),Giratina(all burst into laughter)-dark is light,light is dark/happy and sad each moment Mr Oak/Mr Oak why are you so stark(all burst into laughter)-that pest irritates me whole day for 4 years now(all laugh) as i get investigated by Zeraora(all burst into laughter),Heatran(all laugh) – what is an attack(all burst into laughter),Genesect(all laugh),Marshadow(all burst into laughter)-Mr Skechit(all laugh),Yveltal(all burst into laughter)- in pursuit of hapiness(all laugh),Solgaleo(all burst into laughter) – life means sorrow(all laugh),Groudon(all laugh),Goodra(all laugh) – count the count(all laugh),Zeraora(all burst into laughter) Mr Oak Mr Oak what is a pokemon(all laugh) exactly what this pest said THIS IS THE MAIN PEST(all burst into laughter),Volcanion(all laugh),Metagross(all laugh) – hallucinating reality of hallucination(all laugh),Darkrai(all laugh) – wake while dreaming(all laugh),Deoxys(all burst into laughter) – what is constant(all laugh),Kommo-O(all burst into laughter)- the sensei(all laugh) then finally finally please welcome the Ash-killer(all .) Togekiss(all burst into laughter and .)...that was the biggest thing really and Ash was laughing seeing a Togekiss(all laugh)..grandpa said he was just laughing and shaking his head cause as Lance said if this makes the husband to quit it now(all laugh)..please eternal husband(all laugh)...
Misty(smile,same pose,Ash too same pose laughter) : “he won’t(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “sweet Togepi...right(all smile),no i was laughing really cause Togekiss was  in comparison to the preceeding 18 psudeo-legends(all laugh) and Rotom(all laugh) so she was just a matter of Tyranitar(all laugh) and so i was just thinking that definitely Mist will be advised to not watch this match(all laugh) cause to the Daisyl(all laugh) unless a certain jackal uses the second cousin mask(all laugh) it is better to be sentimental(all laugh) and to the Wig(all laugh) it means a trophy for another 10 years means now her baby sis will be 55(all burst into laughter)...57(all burst into laughter)..right(all laugh),so the wig was conspiring with the most honoured Violet sister who was easily apprised cause she had a huge problem cause a crook(all laugh) was trying to be philosophical during lunch breaks(all laugh),so i knew Mist won’t be seeing and if she did won’t be liking it so i thought whoever comes next i’ll just say scare her let her go(all laugh)..but then they won’t listen(all laugh) cause each only had one brat to feed on(all laugh) except the final(all laugh)..so that was my thought and i really was laughing(all laugh)..mom later scoffed me why didn’t you let her and her master win atleast one(all laugh) to which i said only my Mist beats me totally each time(all laugh)...so(all laugh),that was going on really...”
Gary(laugh) : “well about sentiment card,Trace will say his behind the back staffs stuff later(all laughter) but Togekiss was really something indeed...aunty later said why do they use such sweet little pokemons for battling(all laugh)...now Ash as you know used 72 different pokemons each round(all laugh) barring Chu(all laugh) and he had 93 then barring Mime,Butterfree wasn’t there as we were still blessed(all laugh) and 19 came in Unova then had of course Gengar(all laugh) before and still Ultranercozma(all laugh) during Team Rocket and 10 in Kalos despite there he trekked so less but because went to the most dangerous inhibitaions like to soulmate a Heatran,Zeraora(all laugh) i’ll terminate that brat along with the Giratina behind hallucinations(all laugh) and then a Deoxys,Zygarde(all laugh),Darkrai then still a Malamar(all laugh)-just get them off Ash you know they spoil Gili and Lillie(all laugh)...anyway(all burst into laughter,.,cheer),this dense brat pokes my personal life(all laugh) and will tomorrow again(all laugh)..but we enjoy the tiffin(all laugh)...”
Misty(same pose,bit agitated,Ash laughs same pose) : “SHUT UP(all laugh)! Your wife immitates me(all burst into laughter)...my(all laugh) sweet hubby(all laugh)...won’t(all laugh) share his tiffin with you(all laugh)...tell that devilil to cook herself(all laugh) and you Lil i warn you(all laugh) don’t look at my hubby(all laugh)...no Ash these two mingle in foods(all laugh) and now using the Lugias trying to keep you away from me(all laugh)...you namecall Gary why is your wife after my Ash(all burst into laughter)..”
Gary(laugh) : “Cascade rematch(all burst into laughter)..then got away witth 2 words and the young flower dream(all laugh)..really in gross terms Ash has walked away with...(all laugh)”
Daisy(laugh) : “so many things seen in the dreams/some come some not like the dreams/but oh you oh my sweet flower dreams(all laugh)/i want the young flower dreaming in my dreams(all burst into laughter and .)...”
Misty(same pose,irritated,Ash laughs) :”SHUT UP!(all burst into laughter)...you got me involved first playing sentimental tricks(all laugh) to first take me away for my Ash...and(all laugh) then playing similar tricks got me in shows CAUSE YOUR jackal ABJECTLY FAILED IN BOTH(all burst into laughter)...you Trace DON’T DARE CALLING MY HUSBAND AGAIN(all laugh)...”
Tracey(laugh) : “seeing the bee that Misty flower dream(all laugh)/hearing the voice as this cunning  pro sing/says if you come anywhere near the gym(all laugh)/you’ll get the Gengleye pair welcoming you as team(all laugh)/if you try to utter the name Misty or it so seem(all laugh)/behind you there’s Giraoopa now lights have got so dim(all burst into laughter)/so the spotlight should only shine on my head down to shin(all laugh)/but if ever you try to defect i’ve a 19 ghost team(all laugh and .)...really what a technique to grab the spotlight away from all mere mortals and shield anyone at will cause aren’t the lights above my head getting a bit to dim/so now please welcome my ghostly 19(all laugh)..and then there’s still another 2 ghosts Decidueye(all laugh) and Trevenant(all burst into laughter) what chosen brats those two are(all laugh)..we can never forget the psychic tv show on that most important authority meeting yesterday at the lab(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “um..just a sec if you may allow my flower wants me to change that song(all laugh)..”
Misty(frown,same pose) : “NONE OF YOU ARE ALLOWED(all burst into laughter)..my(all laugh) sweet bee..will(all laugh) ONLY TELL ME(all laugh)...NOW(all burst into laughter) GET THIS YOU INFATUATED NAMECALLS(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “Mist,you’re so sweetie(all laugh)...right(all laugh),well i’m sorry but i guess it should be in privacy hard for me now in bigger domain looking at my wife’s sinister disposition(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “so do i Ashey-boy...anyway(all burst into laughter),no you spoil my life you brat(all laugh) just get off,night(all laugh)”
Ash(smile) : “2 words next term”(all laugh and reciprocate all bye and else)
(few minutes later)
(looking at Misty smile,hugging her very firmly,Misty smiles at Ash hugging him firmly)
so many things so nice the thing is they aren’t real/because they don’t come from me thus all are unreal/in there’s nothing out or in except i what i may be/won’t express can’t express ask my Mist as eternally i’m just she(both smile at each other)..so many things came around nothing ever mattered/where i’m what i’m all my ego’s chatter/roamed around totally free yet i wasn’t me/finally found that my Mist is me thus i must be she(both hug each other very firmly smiling for sometime)...”

(2 days later,night,middle)

Gary(laugh) : “first Persy before said i laughed so much as Ash said ah weekends don’t you feel a bit lonely for seriousness then(all burst into laughter) so had it on Friday(all laugh) only but all the Elite4 heads were here(all burst into laughter) with a few lackies(all laugh) as PERSONAL PROTECTION(all laugh),6 lackies 1 each except their coustomery secretaries but they were outside  with grandpa and Lenny and all disconnected(all laugh) and actually had Muk(all burst into laughter) who was enough for poor guys(all laugh),Persy’s secretary Liam knew everything and told Lenny and grandpa what was going to happen(all laugh) and was very happy to see the plight of his colleagues there who were fed Muk(all laugh) yeah during the test they got Torquail(all burst into laughter) so no progress was made(all laugh) then they were agitated so got Bayleaf(all burst into laughter) then before giving up tried the ashes to phoenix stuff thus made the worst mistake by asking for any ailining one(all burst into laughter) thus they weren’t sane when they came out as they told Zekrom to thunderbolt burst into tears(all laugh) not one attack they managed tried to read her words got that bit(all laugh) then they were angry and forced Ash to tell her to attack Ash says,’sweetie,i do cherish you so much(all burst into laughter)’,’but but i’m weak so you DON’T CHERISH ME THE MOST(all burst into laughter)’ this is classic that they got that a pokemon was connected to which level to her master(all laugh) then Ash says,’ok i will fondle you(all laugh)’,’BUT YOU WERE TELLING ME TO ATTACK TO KILL ME’(all burst into laughter) then Ash was grave but we realized how much both were enjoying this(all laugh) then Ash says,’listen brat(all laugh),either you attack and battle or i’ll kick you out’,’how many beaus(all burst into laughter),who are illegal(all burst into laughter),bring each brat together(all laugh)’,’just give a thunderbolt that’s all’,’you do it(all burst into laughter)..who are these different looking brats(all laugh) hey you whoose your beau(all burst into laughter) bring all immediately(all burst into laughter) i’ll show them(all laugh)’ then Ash says,’sweetie(all laugh),don’t you cherish me(all laugh)’,’but but THESE DIFFERENT LOOKING GUYS DON’T LIKE ME(all burst into laughter,.)’...yeah this is exactly the thing even if the whole world cherishes her she’ll say all because i’m weak(all burst into laughter) then if forced more will go on how while she was sleeping who were roaming around(all laugh) and how each moment doesn’t the time passes she feels weaker cause the last moment’s fondling was better(all burst into laughter) then Ash says,’you damn brat immediately thunderbolt(all laugh)’,’hey you,how many beaus(all laugh) some choised brats sneaked away behind hallucinations last hour(all burst into laughter) bring each to me(all laugh)’,’these are girlfriend type(all burst into laughter)’,’but but THEY DON’T CHERISH ME(all burst into laughter)’,’Tyranitar(all burst into laughter) um..senors(all laugh) can i use Jason’s whole bunch(all burst into laughter)’..they were paralyzed to see this(all laugh) then Jason was there of course(all laugh) says fine releases 10 or so(all laugh),’you damn brat thunder-chair each(all laugh)’,Zekrom minutely looks at each for a momet then say,’substandard(all burst into laughter) hey you whoose who’s beau(all burst into laughter)’ this question gets Jason and all totally befooled(all laugh) BUT none of the pokemons budged(all laugh) then they looked at Jason saying why are we out(all laugh)..so Jason is totally dumbstruck now Ash says ’Jason did you believe i couldn’t catch a legend and turned on anyone if i wished to(all laugh)..no wait Jason,how did Zekrom got your bunch to fondle her despite the words(all laugh)’,Jason is very angry cause he’s 7 league 5-2 winner(all laugh) says,’Ash listen how do we know that you won’t do what you say you can(all laugh)’,’i see Jason honesty isn’t a great virtue then(all laugh)’,’Ash you know more than me that they can’t get deceit(all laugh)’,’but you also know more than me that you can(all burst into laughter)’ that was enough for Jason cause they did backstab Ash(all laugh) so that session finishes there(all laugh) and Ash said how hard it was cause the pokemons first were connected by Zekrom to Ash then Ash told them forget Zekrom look at me(all laugh) i’m Zekrom and our communication is inbetween see then Ash sweared Zekrom(all laugh) who reciprocated(all laugh) whoose who’s beau was said pointing to none(all laugh) and substandard means all of Ash’s beaus are so(all laugh) cause that was in between then that Ash her Ash told her to thunderbolt before connecting to others which means as that is just a playful word Zekrom won’t do a thing but will look at each minutely to detect their master’s intension first(all laugh) as soon as she knows that the master is different to his bunch(all laugh) she’ll inform Ash mentally that this is substandard food(all laugh) atleast their beaus together would’ve been better(all laugh) this means not attack at all means these buffoons don’t have the remote brains to reciprocate me so i can’t play with them(all burst into laughter) then only connect other’s to Ash who will be now mentally telling Zekrom that you only are unhappy cause my other Zekrom friends play with me a lot so you think i don’t cherish you(all burst into laughter) this will rile Zekrom up cause this is the memory that all have of girlfriendmon(all laugh) and her different beaus(all laugh) but that too won’t be attack just inter-Zekrom secret(all laugh) so Zekrom will repeat that line with another meaning(all laugh) this will totally decimate the brats if they ever had a doubt that while testing them mentally Zekrom was trying to attack them(all laugh) and then those brats were bemused cause it wasn’t directed to them(all laugh) they were forgotten totally(all laugh) then very next moment Ash told Zekrom i don’t cherish you(all laugh) then Zekrom said but i cherish you so much(all laugh) this meant an intercommunication between couples(all burst into laughter) and those were eavesdropping(all burst into laughter) so then this communication was going on and the rest is forgoten they have no intension to harm Jason’s bunch so totally befooled they are(all laugh) but then the worst thing for Jason was that Ash after those moments when was talking with Jason then Jason’s bunch which itself had a Zekrom(all laugh) straight goes to Zekrom and fondles her(all laugh) now this makes Jason totally devastated cause first the backstab insinuation(all laugh) now Ash can control his bunch without even looking at his own Zekrom(all laugh) and Ash said i told Zekrom that i dump you(all laugh) that meant Zekrom is trained that Ash wants her to disconnect from him and do the rest herself(all laugh) so Zekrom is back to her legend taming self again(all laugh) and told the others that see none cherishes me BUT BUT I CHERISH YOU SO MUCH(all burst into laughter) and thus Zekrom herself has no intension to battle(all laugh) cause the only time she would is when Ash really means it(all laugh) thus the others see hardly a problem so goes to play(all laugh)..this was mastery over a Xormnuh+ legend with powers to match who gets a substandard food like a Zekrom and a Hoopa(all laugh) and also would if it was a Ghostradarkarrigussonor double(all laugh)..then now Jason comes back(all laugh),’Ash i understand what Trevor did wasn’t right by any means and also dragging you..’,’and my wife(all laugh)’ then Jason realizes the trouble says,’would you go again if such situtaion arises if we provide best support possible’,’Jason,why the whole world is against my wife’,’but the possibility remains’,’Jason look i will go anywhere only if the general government is beside me and as they should’ve as we all agree in Unova no matter what and none gets away with a lure machine like that and sure with Mark that atleast isn’t happening again but your possibilities are same we both know Trevor and he even lost his mind my problem you know very well my demand and everything is that my wife should have me with her unless an accident and you know what is an accident and what isn’t if i’m facing the whole world with double number of legends thus my trouble is neither my condition nor her decision to go to Orange which she will do again and again no matter what condition she’s in but both our demands are that we’re not soldiers thus we don’t deserve that tag of immoratality just that and neither does any pokemon no matter who or whoose that too with the fact that to decide on their future all parties must be consulted as well this much as well’ that was it cause he knows what these mean but then to our utmost delight wakes up Snorlax(all laugh) who were told to sleep near the exit(all laugh) and before we left Buzzwole was told to wake him up and tell him to be prepared which meant he will feign sleeping and will jump on Trace(all laugh),so straight sees Trace jumps in with Marshadow(all laugh) then fondles everyone and all and Ash pointing to them just tells him,’this is what i was saying that why are you after my life Jason by all means(all laugh)’ then Jason lectures(all laugh) and says fine we’ll talk in the meeting(all laugh) this all takes 2 hours or a bit more by when all things are ready in the conference room(all laugh) which we silently enter as our soulmates were being directed by Meowstic, and Uxie what is going around the who place(all laugh)...please that bit..”
Lillie(laugh) : “really the whole Elite4 got abjectly Ketchumed(all laugh) we all knew the plans as Dave told us afterwards who now says what battling what competition feed us such choised brats each day(all laugh) and Dave is also preparing a trick now with his bunch(all laugh) that’s telling the opponent doesn’t your master date mine(all burst into laughter) this will get the challenger totally dumbfounded(all laugh) cause it means the intensity isn’t necessary(all laugh) so Dave is so happy says this is real pokemon mastery whoose who’s beau bring each brat together(all laugh) and says so many books and lectures(all laugh) i never thought that philosophy is so funny(all laugh)...aww..Lil my Ash is so sweetie(all burst into laughter)”
Gary(laugh) : “Ah!sweetie!sweetie!(all burst into laughter)...”
Misty(agitated,same pose,Ash laughs same pose) : “SHUT UP!(all laugh)..tell these to Tyranitar(all burst into laughter)..he’s(all laugh) only my sweetie(all burst into laughter)..um..(all laugh)...sweetie,cut the call i wish so(all laugh)...you namecalls don’t dare to come near my Ash(all laugh)...no Ash,don’t mingle with these infatuated namecalls...when you didn’t talk with these namecalls after confessing they told you’re infatuated(all laugh) and now they are seeing you they are conspiring against me(all burst into laughter)..SHUT UP!...you namecalls will tell my Ash that i send him special tiffins is because i’m infatuated with him(all burst into laughter)...i’ll complain to Feraligator(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “wish fulfilled(all burst into laughter)..complain lodged to a Mr FeraliGator(all laugh) that a Mr Oak is a bit professional now a days(all laugh)..now continue(all laugh)..this is the effect of each day not eating by own hands for 6 constant months(all laugh)...right(all laugh),which has been TAUGHT(all laugh)...”
Gary(laugh) : “and today itself has been tested at my expense(all laugh)...no(all burst into laughter),you and your wife has spoiled Lil really(all burst into laughter,.)”
Lillie(laugh) : “all i need to do is to say that he doesn’t like me(all laugh)...really bro retired life is incredible(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “but my jackal is extremely cunning(all laugh) he was told to learn the art(all laugh) himself and then cajole me into sentimental outbursts just then making a face(all laugh) tell me that he’s a human(all burst into laughter)..this brat has ruined my personal life(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “when i said the art is difficult(all laugh) said ‘i see,difficult,sweet sweet jackal(all burst into laughter) why do i find that your Venonat is a bit too healthy(all burst into laughter)’ then i said that 6 months and 25 years(all laugh) difference says,’i see,but Trace please Trace i can FEEL them Trace(all burst into laughter),you are insinutaing that you’re too busy to help your wife(all laugh),Torquail(all burst into laughter) see this brat(all laugh)...Torquail and full family(all laugh) pestered me the whole day(all laugh) then i realized that unless i learn arts Lugias will jump me which means(all laugh) better be at home than at hostel(all burst into laughter)...”
Violet(laugh) : “well even in this one the family is involved(all burst into laughter,Brock laughs shaking his head) first i’m to express my wish exactly when Brock can’t(all laugh) so if Brock doesn’t fulfil the wish later by breaking trust(all laugh) or in the beginning itself beg to me that he can’t that day(all laugh) then he is agitated by Dialga(all laugh) and gang(all laugh) then Foster is told to do this first(all burst into laughter) who will tell Flores that because of his experience on the calm nature of water types,it won’t help much in her profession(all burst into laughter) which is extremely dangerous(all laugh) so mom will ask Brock what does he know about water type sentiments(all burst into laughter) now mom’s calls anytime except the normal 100(all laugh) means i’m setting a trap for my hubby(all laugh) so he has to immediately call me then i remind him my wish or something that he must do else the ultimate complain will be issued to the Gengleyedauntogatorlerphlosion(all burst into laughter) which no human or pokemon would want to face(all laugh)...or else if Brock still wants to try the ashes to phoenix stuff(all burst into laughter)...or Gary does so with Lil then we’ve been told to express our knowledge on DESTINY(all laugh)...which i did one day(all laugh)...just as he was too tired didn’t want to do something i said yeah it’s destiny that he doesn’t have to do it(all burst into laughter)...”
Brock(laugh) : “no this pest has turned on me really(all laugh)..cause mom of all people has been told that i think my life now is JUST a destiny(all laugh)...and Foster is encouraged to be more professional(all laugh) and Flores is told how and at which points that makes people extremely vulnerable to UNCERTAINTY(all burst into laughter)..which a Dr Oak Dr Oak knows very well(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “no really i mean i never thought that tricking my lion would be this easy(all laugh) surely i can tame legends too(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “but i got the flack(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “cause the jackal said that ‘um..um..(all laugh)..um..Ash i’m busy you know won’t have time to read so can you give me a few quotes(all brsut into laughter)’...and tricking the jackal is too easy ONLY for an inhuman(all laugh) to do which most dear Daisyl(all laugh) will have to mingle with Gengleyedauntogatorlerphlosionmitoadrottzel(all laugh)..so how was the picture and Mewostic’s commentary(all laugh)...”
Lillie(laugh) : “commentary was amusing(all laugh)...Dave came a bit later so wasn’t there Zara tells us will be a great movie(all laugh) then we were instructed to go to the room by Beeheeyem and we get packed into the room with Uxie and Meowstic,all the performers were kept inside the conference room whole night(all laugh) then the rooms were opened and all they were kept in pokeballs with us and later released by Zara who was informed by Dave as Ash called Dave in time to tell him he’s longing rightly for his beaus(all laugh) then after getting released the pests themselves got to the spot cause the whole night everything was surveyed(all laugh) then finally Meowstic and Uxie zapped into the room and after learning everything Beeheeyem told us to get in and we chided every staff away(all laugh) or fed them to grandpa(all laugh) who was being advised by Muk(all laugh) who knew every bit of the things that the ghosts were doing and thus kept the secretaries extremely busy(all laugh) so now we get in and Uxie greets us saying he’s telling us that all that they are doing are natural to them thus they aren’t doing anything at all(all burst into laughter) but is his way of telling us right(all burst into laughter) anyway we set in first in comes Beeheeyem who tells Meowstic all are getting ready you may start but what did i just tell you(all burst into laughter) now Meowstic tells us this unmindfullness is only cause Beeheeyem isn’t still(all laugh) now they connect to the ghosts who are saying among themselves that how if some choised brats enter here how should Noivern treat them(all laugh),Noivern is Zapped in there by the psychic group then Noivern hides himself and the ghost and psychic group discusses how the choised brats that aren’t pokemon are only girlfriendmon’s beaus(all laugh) to which Noivern points out that those who are pokemons must be told not to mingle with not pokemons cause at their age this mixing will arouse some difficult issues like freedom of thought(all burst into laughter) now Beeheeyem enters that room again leaving us who says not to forget what they just forgot(all laugh) to which Noivern says you will zap me out of here on right time don’t get lost in thoughts(all burst into laughter) to which Beeheeyem says have you given a thought on how you will fit in the room already containing 4 humans more to come(all laugh) and having choised brats like Uxie and Meowstic who doesn’t have anything to do so joking with the humans(all burst into laughter) to which Noivern says just that age(all burst into laughter) to which ghosts ask are the humans unhappy(all burst into laughter) the psychic group says always why else would one want their pokemons to battle without a reason(all burst into laughter and .) what would your thoughts be ghosts if your beau is taken away(all burst into laughter) but that’s still not battle is it you were the chosen brat to lead your group at your place(all laugh) you must know what that is...yeah that group was infighting for no thoughts(all laugh) just the blooming youth(all uncontrollably laugh) master went with choised brats like Yveltal(all laugh) saw him seemed more of the right cognitive age for me(all burst into laughter) so came here but there a few died and all not due to battle have you ever thought what if your opponents were of same type and you cherished her(all burst into laughter) the ghosts say well thats exactly when you’ll get unhappy won’t you(all burst into laughter and .) only at the present moment are you happy to see your beau but do you know your happiness was at present past or future how do you know when you see your beau that you like your beau cause it might’ve been just a moment ago not the present moment(all burst into laughter) yeah i’ve been telling a Mr Oak for years now exactly this(all burst into laughter) too serious moment to moment(all laugh) doesn’t answer Zeraora that why we are what we are(all laugh) cause he’s serious(all burst into laughter) but yeah the meaning of the liking of your beau when you see first time and your beau reacts to you means that it’s serious(all uncontrollably laugh) yeah look you live in a different sort of dark planes to us but we don’t understand that why say two psychics same type even if like each other or say you get 1000 opponents out of which you like 100 beaus(all laugh) and they will have their own beaus(all laugh) but would we then use zapping or something like that rather just direct confrontation and yeah you’re killed but see when you’re with a master surely that need is looked after like we’re getting so we won’t jump on beaus we’d politely ask for a date(all burst into laughter) yeah unlike Charizard(all burst into laughter) but you’ll get unhappy again when they or their beaus refuse(all laugh) yeah we understand but it’s not that only they are there(all burst into laughter) neither is it that as Yveltal says wanting your beau too much will make you unhappy(all burst into laughter) just the proportion(all burst into laughter) means you should be afraid of yourself(all laugh) that it’s the time when you’re finding your beau will make you unhappy so in between that and not having a beau is happiness when you’re being found out(all burst into laughter) if you can tickle yourself being your beau and yeah make yourself do so by being them(all burst into laughter) yeah Butterfree agrees but the picture of your beau how can you be sure that your beau looks perfect(all burst into laughter) why is your beau not you(all burst into laughter) cause they’re not afraid of themselves(all burst into laughter) purely(all burst into laughter) yeah like if they want beaus but doesn’t look good it’s difficut to live such a life(all burst into laughter) then they may want to be of another type(all laugh) too many good or bad in one never right cause if you don’t want to explore other possibilites how can you know that this relationship is not good(all burst into laughter) yeah the proportion is needed that to your beau how much you reciprocate(all laugh) cause your own choises can proportionally vary(all laugh) yeah from time to time(all burst into laughter) but do you know the actual time when you decide that this is it(all burst into laughter) yeah when you were sleeping and then woke up just in-between your beau screamed so that moment didn’t last long thus your beau is not good to break your sleep(all burst into laughter) but unless your beau rejects you how can you know who you are(all burst into laughter) from time to time yeah(all burst into laughter) have you ever given a thought that why like ghosts and psychics natural enemies co exists(all laugh) beacause the beaus are different so we’re happy(all burst into laughter) but Heracross doesn’t agree(all uncontrollably laugh) no just like master many beaus(all burst into laughter) did you forget what i said that i had this idea of many choised brats entering the place today as i said what i said(all laugh) yeah you just zap in and out me properly kids needs to be guided home(all burst into laughter)...so this was going on(all laugh) as Meowstic tells us and Uxie each moment asks us if each communication is proper or not(all laugh) then in the lackies room 3 are there who now tells Meowstic that they are trying to figue out the different approaches to pokebrats and human brats(all laugh) and Rayquaza was there in the passage(all laugh) outside two room respectively of the main conference room and the lackies room who says the doors will be guarded but at each moment we’ll change our mind on whether to be of our type or dragon(all laugh) besides Uxie the other 3 brats that look after us in the lab(all laugh) have they forgotten that their 2nd masters are here(all burst into laughter)..yeah a Mr Oak is to be here who unnecessarily goes to the lab with an unhappy mood with a few choised brats of his out of which 3 groud types and the Magmorter and Golem are intelligent only(all laugh) and the rest like Mr Oak don’t know why they are happy and sad in cycles each moment(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) then there’s someone who has a Scyther who isn’t happy about his activities(all burst into laughter,Tracey laughs shaking his head) who tries to keep patience in right proportion but eventually runs out of it to again try(all burst into laughter) perfect food though to torment(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) but there’s a man a new import here but was with the master for ages unlike that 2nd master brat who Chu says unnecessarily left and then doesn’t come back but wants to(all burst into laughter) strange beings(all burst into laughter,.) yeah ever knew the 2nd brat doesn’t know the right proportion of fodnling the master(all burst into laughter) cause she was too serious(all burst into laughter) yeah wasn’t sure when the master brat was happier with her fodnling past present or future(all burst into laughter) so never knew the present fondling(all laugh) too serious for life(all burst into laughter) tickle in past then lick in present repeat in future(all burst into laughter) yeah but they need training(all burst into laughter) but this new imported brat(all laugh,Brock laughs shaking his head) is like master brat has told us and we saw before he came here and also now that he and his bunch is naive(all burst into laughter,Brock burst into laughter .ly) yeah a great food cause tries his best to intrude our lives with his own opinions on that(all burst into laughter,Brock laughs shaking his head) thus making him the ideal prey(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) and there’s a brat that has a Dewgong and a bunch of innocent water types who are now rightly taught to be happy cause they weren’t(all laugh) and she gets sentimental with us thus making her a true food all time(all laugh) but she should behave like the two little humans that stay with her and she takes care of them but doesn’t learn from them(all uncontrollably laugh,Daisy in tears almost laughing) yeah just afraid of herself being happy(all burst into laughter,Daisy in tears laughing) but her moods will pass or come where is she(all burst into laughter,Daisy fits of laughter) in between waking seriousness and dreaming depression(all burst into laughter,tears) yeah never knew the right proportion when around Mr Skechit as we hear(all burst into laughter,Tracey and Daisy both burst into laughter) then there’s another who has as well a few water fools(all laugh) like a Cloyster who doesn’t know where he is(all laugh) rightly though(all burst into laughter) but too serious to recognize that he can’t know who he is(all burst into laugter) yeah his master fondles us too much but is after Mr Oak all time(all burst into laughter,Lillie .s laughing) and she has a little human who unlike her is never serious(all burst into laughter) cause he sees the right point of who he is or not inbetween the states(all burst into laughter) purely balanced(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) well we hear the only time the human brat isn’t serious is when she jumps on Mr Oak to say why are you not me(all burst into laughter,.) and another who beahaves abnormally with the new import(all laugh) has only one Mantine who is obviously naive(all burst into laughter) like that new imported brat(all laugh) our Mantine said she fondles him and her Mantine and that new import is always after her when she’s just in the middle too much bonhomie(all burst into laughter,.) must be beaus(all laugh) and the other brat that is there who has a Pidgey only that is a too little to understand pokelife aspects like suddenly appearing to tickle(all burst into laughter) and that brat comes around here too jovial to get in troubles(all laugh) and whoose 1st master roams around with 93 pokebrats who in rounds somethimes come here to unsuccessfully pick on beaus(all burst into laughter) without understanding that tickling alone isn’t sufficient to fetch one needs to distribute the plans of tickled cherishing(all laugh) that human brat goes somewhere each day with a few chosen brats unnecessarily(all laugh) then tell us nonsense stories of how they were emotional seeing plight of some other brats who cried cause they were being hindered by their masters from meeting their beaus frequently the exact reason for which Charizard and Squirtle are afraid to stay here(all burst into laughter and .) that human brat is supposed to enter the conference room last where’s he(all laugh) no will come after the master brat but do you think that your way of conveying your thoughts to me is proper(all laugh) i mean you mentioned brats but who are the beaus(all burst into laughter) we’ve been told to guard the doors cause master brat will come at his time after being with his girlfriend brat and few choised beaus(all burst into laughter) Noivern who is girlfriend(all laugh) Gengleye may give you a better thought(all laugh) oh just the girlfriend of that brat we cured cause she was serious(all burst into laughter and .) roams around with her whole day both too ridiculously happy yet sad(all burst into laughter) but you only know the past what’s the present position(all burst into laughter) in-between thoughts(all burst into laughter) cause they are serious(all burst into laughter,.) though we don’t understand Chu said that brat was with master brat since first day too much geniality(all burst into laughter and .) yeah but you see by means of psychic channels it’s been told that that brat whom we don’t know a non male brat or not(all laugh) is the special 2nd master brat(all laugh) cause both those brats chose a day when they were looking at each other in proximity for ages boring all of us to death(all burst into laughter,.) despite we were telling them to tickle each other(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) and consequently were happy and sad at the same time which we didn’t understand why(all laugh) just they don’t know the starkness in difference(all burst into laughter) at no time when together yeah(all burst into laughter) then master brat only behaves like that with us so it must be the special master brat 2nd(all laugh) yeah Chu said that that brat whole day looked at master’s picture(all burst into laughter) yet was unhappy(all burst into laughter) and still now too unhappy always even with the master brat strange creatures(all burst into laughter and .) so the girlfriend must be her girlfriend(all laugh) must be afraid of the beaus Chu said drove a few beaus away from that 2nd brat cause she invited one(all burst into laughter,.) and when her beaus turned on that bart and Golduck lost his mind as usual again cause he doesn’t know the meaning of difference in appearneces(all laugh and calp)... yeah but do you remember when me and Goodra was with the master brat last against 2 idiots without much intelligence(all laugh) and thus they seemed to be thoughtless(all burst into laughter) Crawdaunt gave a thought that they didn’t distribute the dating plans their minds enough to rev the occasion up get excited more(all burst into laughter) but Feraligator thoughtfully and rightly said all plans of dating are to turn on each other(all burst into laughter and .) cause Charizard does that to keep options away(all burst into laughter,.),yeah Chu said and we also saw that after the master brat and that 2nd brat reunited they literally were in the middle of joy and sorrow and literally jumped on each other(all burst into laughter and .) so the plan of feeding us substandard food like brats who wanted to battle(all burst into laughter and .) cause they were in-between relations(all burst into laughter,.) but couldn’t care to talk with their beaus(all burst into laughter,cheers for Ash,who .ly laughs) and thus the 2 master brats separated from each other only to jump on themselves(all laugh) psychics were you happy with the food(all laugh),mere youths in transition from dream to waking(all uncontrollably laugh,.) but the 2nd brat’s brats are told like she cherishes them so much yet she doesn’t(all laugh and .) what’s Zekrom’s opinion Meowstic(all laugh),can’t be still with one particular thought(all burst into laughter,.) yeah Chu said the two since 1st day were acting strange with each other having no intension to battle but were in between joy and sorrow and were trying to do something among themselves and were in proximity too much(all burst into laughter) especially the second brat always started it(all burst into laughter) so yeah to her all is so sweet yet not(all laugh) what does she want psychics(all laugh) wants to be master’s pokemon(all burst into laughter cheers .) but doesn’t know the right fondling position(all burst into laughter,.) but Beeheeyem does master want her,well as the ghosts said master forgot what he did to her the next moment she was asleep and chided them to be attentive surely must want her otherwise why bother(all laugh and .) but yeah that brat Bulbasaur said the 2nd brat is rather serious these days unlike before(all burst into laughter) just forgotten the past little kids(all burst into laughter) but Chu says Noivern konws more as he was compelled to hold a heavy material that Chu says was a picture of the 2nd brat(all laugh and .) yeah,master was lost in thoughts of seriousness(all burst into laughter,.) thus consequesntly forgot to tickle the picture and was sad(all burst into laughter,.) Chu said that that was the 2nd brat and to us the only way that could happen if some of us are sick and master knows it so yeah that 2nd brat was sick and thus the master brat cured her or something like that(all laugh) we still tickle the master if sick proportionally unlike her(all laugh) difficult to realize though why such thoughts arise in one and why for that exact brat and her beaus the master brat is too concerned(all laugh) yeah,just wants to make her happy cause she’s unhappy cause girlfriend attacks her frequently(all burst into laughter) yeah but the time when master relieved us of that boring work of looking after that 2nd brat never knowing the right time to suddenly jump on the master though we were telling her to tickle the master(all burst into laugher) but the exact time when we were told to go of Crawdauntogator was called in to hold that brat so that master can fondle her(all laugh) then finally the master bodyslammed her(all laugh) exactly that moment we don’t know what emotions were going though but Bulbasaur said we were only relieved cause they were tired after such a long time of seriousness(all burst into laughter) strange beings(all laugh) we don’t see though why would she be unhappy or why would the master care so much for her for no apperant reason cause it’s not that they have to be separated(all . and cheer) but they do many times when they go to other rooms(all uncontrollably laugh,.) strage thing Noivern isn’t it,exactly why you see i’ve telling all since day one to give a thought on the thought that life is strange(all burst into laughter,cheer,.)...”
Ash(laugh,same pose) : “yeah whole day that would go on if i tell them to be serious cause they don’t want to be so all of us are roasted(all laugh) yeah life is strange(all lugh) but what does my sweet tiffin say...”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “they and me and my bunch are just with my sweet hubby(all smile)..in(all laugh) your face you namecalls(all laugh,all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “right(all laugh)...right(all laugh),then professor Lillie may we know about the beaus that entered the room to check(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “we were over the moon really hearing these all and Zara by now more or less realizes the signals and we told her later she was in tears laughing(all laugh)...so then finally the heads without Persy and lackies enter and release thir bunch each about 5 ghosts(all laugh).. now Uxie says both rooms have been filled with complete idiots(all laugh) who thinks they are proper in presentating themselves as attacks(all laugh) then the ghosts say psychics why don’t we have a bit of fun,no master brat wants all of that himself today(all laugh) we will have the human food today(all burst into laughter and .) then Noivern suddenly appears exactly in the middle of the table(all laugh) all the 30 ghosts are more scared(all laugh) and the 6 heads don’t know what to do but some tries to open the door which is locked from emergency room by Gourgeist on the signal of Gardevoir of breaching marked circles(all laugh) in the meantime Noivern says comrades colleagues companions(all burst into laughter) i’m here today to share my thoughts on your thoughts of fear and anxiety over your masters actions against me for no reason(all burst into laughter) see what do you represent of your master the emotions or the feeling or the cognitions or the thoughts or the methods or the words or their want to unnecessarily kill me(all laugh)see they are anxious of their well being and uses certain instruments which are on their ears now(all laugh)..which we know won’t work(all laugh)...tell me why are they so anxious(all laugh) they are thinking of themselves forgetting you right now so may i ask that have you ever thought why are you kept inside the pokeball when you can think on the thoughts that appear in your thoughts when you think of your thoughts that thoughts peresent from the outside world on being thought of especially at certain ages that you do or will or have represented(all burst into laughter) each ghost cries to their masters for leaving them for no reason to a mad professor(all burst into lughter) and then turns on them(all laugh) which they somehow manage then Noivern fondles each of the heads with tremendus pace(all laugh) totally messes their dress up(all laugh) then Beeheeyem zaps him back to us(all laugh) then he tells us mere kids(all burst into laughter) then he is zapped out as Ash by then told Beeheeyem to not keep the pest there on our shoulders(all laugh) then the heads try to call their lackies(all laugh) who with their brats are in another world(all laugh) we are reported that pokebrats such as Hoopa and Carresila(all laugh) are utter idiots like their masters who are too serious(all burst into laughter) i’m not giving any names of our ghosts and all cause this is only the beginning(all laugh) so thus the heads understand that it’s of no use to misbehave or try to protect themselves so as soon as they recall thier brats Ash is zapped in by the beautiful Glalie(all burst into laugh) and our soulmates are zapped in by Jellicent(all laugh) now this is before the official commencement of meeting so now Ash says,’an insignificant welcoming note(all burst into laughter) surely you’re familier with my Noivern’s methods(all burst into laughter) then the heads say something which we can’t hear but Ash says,’the door is open just a little hallucination(all burst into laughter) the level don’t get surprized with don’t you know i’ve caught 103 legends to much dismay of Orange and Sinnoh Elite4(all laugh) really why always me(all laugh) then a few minutes of silence and then Ash says,’no no it’s ok sweet sweet Jason(all laugh) already have been given an account on my honesty or the lack of it so you’re free to hold the meeting but see if you wanted to attack my bunch by whatever means BECAUSE THEY CAN’T DETECT CERTAIN EMOTIONS especially when i was in hospital then they can surely defend themselves when i’m out can’t they(all laugh)’ then Uxie says human brats are too serious(all laugh) master brat looks jovial but not ripe enough though(all burst into laughter) so Ash told them to have a seat called for energy drinks(all laugh) and now Persy enters whoose voice we could hear but my lion will take over from here(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “what a show that was(all laugh),so anyway, the plan was huge(all laugh)..all in right times but about the lackies they were in dreams full time seeing each of the CONCERNED pictures(all laugh) and Persy obviously laughed hard said just see what happens to the lackies cause he was told about the plan before(all laugh) we didn’t now the details except Dave,who was over the moon and Zara too(all laugh) but one by one what a movie it was for 30 minutes(all laugh) and that ending(all burst into laughter) anyway,just imagine in the front part Ash and Dave was sitting and Persy was with them just a bit far(all laugh) cause he was on our side(all laugh) now in the front the 6 greats are sitting,Jasu Jason(all laugh) from Sinnoh-new(all laugh),7 league,5-2,Cynthia from Johto-old(all laugh),6 league,5-2,Wendy from Orange-new(all laugh),6 league,5-2,Mark from Unova(all laugh)-too new(all laugh),6 league,6-1,Ivana from Hoenn-old(all laugh),6 league,5-2, and finally our great Stuart(all laugh) from our own Kanto-ever new(all laugh),7 league,6-1 and they tell Persy to sit with them(all burst into laughter) Persy says i have decided to shift a few of my bunch here(all laugh) and he is 8 league,7-0(all laugh) and immediately Ash tells Dave see office works make people so naive(all burst into laughter) and then Jasu and else can’t say one word cause ghosts hold them up(all laugh) Persy was held too cause he from before said i won’t be able to stop laughing(all laugh) then they realized that they have entered Huntelion really(all laugh) and hence no more words(all laugh) and the lackies were sitting on the smaller room beside and we are sitting on the eavesdrop position(all laugh) Ash had some instuments fitted with him and we are sitting there with we 6 and Zara(all laugh) and we can’t see them but Ash told us what was the scene first via pychic channel through Meowstic who was our communicator and coomentator(all laugh) then he told Meowstic to stay with him so the scene in the conference room was like that we only can hear Persy,Ash and Dave rest we can only see and we are told that they are going full vulture(all laugh) Ash,Misty their bunch,all our bunches and we all,Dave,Persy,grandpa huge nexus(all laugh) and Zara is defending us(all laugh) with Samantha giving outside support and Mr Maple too(all laugh) with added a Drew(all laugh) now Meowstic after each communications when goes blank tells us how to sit still(all burst into laughter) so that’s just so much fun(all laugh) and the internal connections and their changes with his full brigade of small size dark fairy ghost psychis were so amusing and complex that it’ll take another day to explain what was happening so i’m leaving that(all laugh) now Ash in that situtaion intentionally doesn’t defend himself Persy plays the neutral Ash(all laugh) and Dave is little bro rubbed the big way(all laugh) so Ash finally tells them do you know why all your allegations are no good and why Persy is trying to tell you so desparately that you see i’ve directly battled against many of you and know some you personally and most certainly you too well Jason as does Dave(all laugh) and all of your are hall of famers per absolute excellence so don’t deserve infact to be doing all these authority duties and battling with unnecessary pressure whereas there are innumerable people who can do the jobs you only read and sign like the 3/4/5 time champs do(all laugh) so why under the light stuffs just look at the lights and whole place gets dark(all burst into laughter) cause  now lets give the scene(all laugh)->
in three rooms and the emergency system and if pokebrats misbehave(all laugh) firstly the Elite4’s wanted Ghostly protection for themselves which was as you see taken care of by Noivern(all laugh) they entered the conference room of course only a Xormnuh+ can detect the innumerable that we have here(all laugh) and we had inneumerable in total(all laugh) not all there but still they were around(all laugh),so no aparatus could detect uleass fit enough to detect a Xormnuh best+(all laugh) which is illegal to carry around cause it can’t be and still if can is illegal so they would’ve been caught red handed(all laugh) and nor can detect their best pokemons(all laugh) so they lose that game there Persy poked them that i’m unprotected cause i’m from Kalos not much about us is known in Kanto so no ghosts can do much(all laugh) this insinuates that don’t bother trying to protect yourself neither you nor your bunch can(all laugh) which is neutral-Ash(all laugh) and this means welcome to Karapaskar(all laugh) and now first all 6 and their lackies checked the room(all laugh) nothing was there so they set their great ghosts out many were there each 5(all burst into laughter) so 30 ghosts plus our may be 20(all laugh) that was seen as well they just left and then the main heads they were lectured off(all laugh) and the connections were Mismagius and Banette provides the hallucination cover for all to give you the real movie hall and black screen stuff that is they hallucinated everyone and then the performers entered their field and hallucinated the viewers(all laugh) then Deoxys to Beeheeyem a channel to see through the performance and yeah ghosts themselves divied the screen as according to what each were given(all laugh) and then Deoxys connects to the movie hall and connectes to Beeheeyem who connects to our movie hall as we’re hosted by Uxie and commentated upon by Meowstic as he describes what is happening(all laugh) and then there similar way the lackiews had Musharna in conference room connecting to Unown in theirs and they were hosted by Reuniclas and the commentary only we got and Ash and Dave got who were connected by Magearna to Gardevoir and Bronzong hosted them with Decidueye to commentate(all laugh) and then Elite4 pokebrats were looked after by Glalie and Jellicent and the lackies room had Celebi and Gourgeist and Rayquaza was in the passage to guard agianst to and fro(all laugh) and you realize that is psudeo-legendary dragon(all laugh) so no Ghostradarkarrigussonor herd was doing to or fro(all laugh) and with Muk there was Gallade to hostage all if they misbehaved or made Grandpa too agitated then would’ve been held up if Muk said so(all laugh) and our very own compassionate stuffs at emergency switch rooms had to host Floatzel(all burst into laughter) who solemly got in and discussed philosophy(all laugh) and she was only with Grumpig(all burst into laughter) they taught them to understand the difference of water and ground and fire too as unproved throuout history(all burst into laughter laugh) and the controllers were dozed off by Grumpig and Floatzel was discussing with Grumpig who showed similar hallucinations sometimes as dreams(all laugh) and this meant any mishap will get watergunned down(all laugh) and would’ve told us were connected to Rayquaza who would’ve informed any of us invading our room not Ash that was disalloed(all laugh) and then still outside their cars etc you know Yveltal,Hydrigon,Reshiram and Latios(all laugh) that means none could do anything and still inside we had Whimsicott and Ribombee to still take care of people from informing the others by means of getting out of the main door(all laugh) other doors were locked literally with the keys with me(all laugh) and then he still kept Infernape,Incineroar,Seismitoad and Pelipper in case of emergencies(all laugh) and then back to conference room as the heads sit and all Persy comes a bit late says from Kalos the road not much known(all burst into laughter) and each by then knew what Persy was upto cause previous day while they called him at night said i’m already on the spot(all laugh) that was it(all laugh) and Ash told them Sunday well don’t you feel most lonely on that day(all burst into laughter) so was wednesday and then all are set up and the movie halls are prepared and all are ready for the appearence of Gengleyegiroopakaimaronoirotshadowlureconmagislashtomb(all laugh) 
pokemons to family,bright to dark(all laugh),if angles don’t appease you,let the devils lurk(all laugh and .),so they start-Jason joined the perfect brotherhood of Gengleye(all burst into laughter and .),in Rototomb Orange learns the art of being afraid of an elusive etectroform(all burst into laughter and . and cheer for Chu),with Giralure Hoenn gets to know the stark differences in brightness of all impure and the pure fire and the vomit too(all burst into laughter laugh . and cheer for May and Drew),Darkramar helps Johto to point out their rightfull place exactly in between two states of dream and waking(all burst into laughter,.),Unova is taken to the perfect university hall showing the perfect slideshow of smiliar handshakes or smiles or scenes to eloquently get lectured on the difference of meanings in similar appreaences(all burst into laughter,. and cheer for Ulterior),Persy gets his homework done by Ultraslash to Ultraslash Kalos on how too many types of money and power conjured at a single place simply because of the luck of being so should make the owner depressed and thus to remove that why to look at others and how to ask others for what exact advices(all burst into laughter and cheer for Ultraslash) and finally our very own beloved Kanto gets to balance the time-height ratio under the tutelege of Duskshadow(all burst into laughter and . and cheer for Duskshadow)...(cheers and . and laugh)...in the 15th  minute now(all laugh) comes in Glaliecent finally to conclude who shows them the ghost and water combination to indicate not to drag Mrs Misty Ketchum ever in anything or else she will set ghosts upon them herself cause she has a Jellicent and Glalie was with her whole world knows(all laugh)..then again hallucinate them with all sorts of fooling around complusory tickling and reciprocrating(all laugh) and all for 10 constant minutes(all laugh) then all become invisible again(all laugh)...now lights come in all the heads except Persy were extremely angry(all laugh),Persy was silently laughing beside one side of Ash and Dave of all hall of famers was sitting on another side of Ash immediately looked at Ash and  said ‘um..i need to go to washroom(all burst into laughter)’..that was it for the others to bust(all laugh) Persy was in tears laughing(all laugh)...all say do you think it’s a joke(all laugh) and they were silently listening and then Ash said i liked the movie didn’t get the irritation or horror(all laugh) then they say this is utmost humilation(all laugh) and Ash said atleast you’re not in hospital being severely impaired with your bunch under the gillotine(all laugh) and most heinously still after 1 year is being followed along with whole family and extended family(all laugh) then the brats said we only are here for assurence(all laugh) then Dave himself said my bro showed to us all how his bunch is attuned to him and he was the one who jumped into fire as did my sister-in-law despite her personal devastations to severe margins and they will be questioned now for not being honest while you will only say sorry still(all laugh) then Jasu says alright this this and all else agreed EXCEPT McShin(all laugh) McShin says he has humiliated me since the loss then Persy said certainly he didn’t tell you to be casual on that day too much we all know what you are and he wasn’t what he is now(all laugh) and then McShin said yeah i get it now your responsibility is getting lessened with such legends(all laugh) we will have a new Lance(all laugh) and Persy says except Mark all will have less burden but also except you cause you’ve yourself volunteered to jump into the mess at Kanto(all laugh) then McShin says yeah yeah i get it too much glee now(all laugh) then Ash said why so serious(all laugh) and the brats had to agree that they should do less at office(all laugh) and then went off(all laugh)..but what a show really(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well that was for sure a great show but my brats said too naive(all laugh) but Zara liked it a lot said why didn’t you call my sis here,i said your sis wasn’t here cause then will give double tiffin(all laugh)..fine(all laugh),so many times told her lunch ok why tiffin(all laugh) ever says that all those moments in Johto hum Ash so much longing wasn’t it Mist Mist you’re my best friend(all laugh),now i’m old so forgotten(all laugh)...right(all laugh),young flower dream(all laugh)...so(all laugh),the Unova final professor..”
Gary(laugh) : “..so,well Ash saved a few chosen brats for the final of course(all laugh) 20 in number out of 93 Sharpedo of course wasn’t used..so 92 and these brats were left whom i’ll describe(all laugh) well try to cause this pest has spoiled them(all laugh) no we keep telling you no pokemons revolt against himself(all laugh) this brat did it in Unova(all laugh)..so,Ash goes first with Bulbasaur now(all laugh)..who finishes Reshiram like yawning(all laugh) with 2 solar beams(all laugh) and looked fresher than when he started(all laugh) and after that noncahalantly went off...yeah 2 solar beams in 1.5 minutes against Reshiram(all laugh) while constantly using sleep powder or leaf seeds except the charge time of atmost 6 seconds(all laugh) and heal in 3(all laugh) and constant leaf blades to keep himself safe,now that charge time is .7 sec(all laugh) and heal in again .3 or .35(all laugh).1 solar beam given immediately to counter their first attack as well as to damamge them but unlike Chu continuing the beam for may be 20 seconds and most brutally he just stayed at one place and did all these cause the beam totally speard throughout the battlefield and each time the water part was totally evaporated and anyone near Bulbasaur wouldn’t have been alive unless Bulbasaur himself wanted this was the 1st beam only then he will go with delivering may be 30 leaf seeds then sleep powder in next 30 seconds and with all other attacks except vine whip and then would drag the almost dead opponent by vine whip and deliver the final blow in no time with another solar beam this time focused and direct thus not that powerfull cause otherwise even 10 Steelixes if were fused would be evaporated in like one 20 seconds and this is after telling the opponent that don’t worry just after this we’ll play(all laugh)..the first solar beam is so strong that even broke all psychic barriers and still flattened the opponent beyond any possibility of returning(all laugh)..Bulbasaur will first come out and take whatever attack possible while hiding himself behind leaf blades that were so many it really did make him invisible and while doing all this he will constantly leaf seed around him and then use sleep powders for 6 seconds or so and then actually this cause that was practices 20000 times before(all laugh) so after 2/3 minutes 2 solar beam and all and Reshiram went straight to pokecentre(all laugh) realeased 2 hours later though(all laugh) each 92 these brats faced were 2-4 hours pokecentre(all laugh)...then i just tell you cause 20 against 20 huge lineup(all laugh) and Kalos final was 10 each for the two utmost brats(all laugh) then only used 74 the whole 20 strong Kanto group including Chu to his utter disgust(all laugh) wasn’t used that’s  94 and then of course Sharpedo so 95 and among rest 10 Butterfree was just becoming jovial,Incineroar was absolutely that(all laugh) and rest 8 were whole Kalos group barring Lycanrock cause that was bet against Tyranitar(all laughter) and Snorlax didn’t bother to go(all laugh) the Kalos group feasted on Elite4 sadly(all laugh) and only Incineroar or Chu was used to get serious fights which they themselves did later Incineroar was totally spoiled by Kanto was pestering the whole world to discoulringly colourful insanity(all laugh) anyway,
Rotom against Squirtle(all laugh) Squirtle again ice beam whirl Rotom is off,Dialga against Bayleaf(all laugh) just solar beam like Bulbasaur was competining with each other(all laugh),Latios vs Muk again(all laugh) and Muk wins but this time the sludge blast is something(all laugh),Zekrom vs Hoopa(all laugh) Hoopa was jovial by then but was dragged so was there then just ghosted out(all laugh) and still fooled around(all laugh),Giratina vs Giratina(all laugh) that was so funny infact(all laugh) and Giratina was stable and just months off from becoming the pest that again will jump me tomorrow(all laugh) and then again so just somthing else,Heatran vs Torquail(all laugh) Toraquail wins and screeches(all laugh),Genesect vs finally Chu(all laugh) and Chu was incensed with the food after this long starving so longest pokecentre for Genesect(all laugh),Yveltal vs Decidueye(all laugh) again just blows away Yveltal,Solgaleo vs Kookodile and Krookodile just send Solgaleo off like a twig(all laugh),Groudon vs Infernape again Infernape is something else wins as if nothing,Goodra vs Ribombee(all laugh) Ribombee wins without the effort needed to have an wink(all laugh),Zeraora vs Floatzel(all laugh) Floatzel yawns Zeraora off(all laugh),Volcanion vs Donphan(all laugh) Donphan just wins(all laugh),Metagross vs Shiftree(all laugh) Shiftree had just become a revolutionary then so Metagross was spared from insanity atleast(all laugh),Darkrai vs Hawlucha(all laugh) Hawlucha brushed Darkrai aside without thought or action(all laugh),Deoxys vs Snorlax(all laugh) Snorlax just snored off Deoxyx(all laugh),Kommo-O comes(all laugh) Ash salutes Kommo-O(all laugh) and all the rest Munro was clapping by then(all laugh) and the referee too cause the match and the final once in a millenia was about to end so all were glued to their sits cause none wanted to return next millenia to see again(all laugh) then that goes Kartana(all laugh) tells Kommo-O life is hard indeed and packs him off to sleep(all laugh) then in between sometimes Munro was smiling and doing a few salutes(all laugh) to which Ash each time in folded hands reciprocated by pointing to his bunch that it was his honour rather and all just his bunch and then at last comes the obvious(all laugh)..now Munro sends Togekiss out and just saluted Ash again and the referee now(all laugh)..the referee himself saluted both and Ash too saluted all were laughing as was the whole world i guess those who were watching outside a certain Gym(all laugh) or if inside then a in the security monitoring room(all burst into laughter)...now Rene of course was a bit taken aback with it in first round but then since 2nd round itself realized that it’s just a matter of time before her husband returns home(all laugh)...and now also was laughing which would’ve made the opposite end other half too happy(all laugh) to namecall her even more(all laugh) but she was a bit confused then about the rute to monitoring room(all laugh)...Iris knew all about this pest and his brats so was laughing since the start,Cilan was extremely dejected(all laugh) and was shaking his head all time while laughing as if to say why did you bother to enter to begin with(all laugh)...now finally comes in Seismitoad(all laugh)...yeah hard now though how water and ground is becoming the other each moment(all laugh)..and after me of course(all laugh)..i should become a trainer again with Tyranitar(all laugh)..so Seismitoad strats with a hyper beam just like Bulbasaur to beat the psychic barriers and then creates the earthquake stuff VERY MILDLY(all laugh) to just show how much powerfull he is as Togekiss after 20 seconds in the beam was already on ground(all laugh) then somehow Togekiss managed to fly a little comes little watergun(all laugh) again shows that is actually tap-call water to him(all laugh)..so now Ash wins his 5th title in no time and then the trophy and all,Grandpa just was laughing and said that this is once ever they should already say for atleast the next 1000 years none is allowed to be called a Pokemon Master(all laugh).. like use 20 Zapdos’s to see if they have any chance against Seismitoad alone or not(all laugh) this was going on and i knew what was happening in his personal life felt bad cause i knew that Kalos was left but he could just tell them to send the title(all laugh) and thought well he just should retire immediately and marry Misty settle down forget everything else about battling cause that’s just impossible in Unova of all places going totally unscathed and undefeated and then this final like this against a 7 league champion just impossible..and yes he was ready then to face absolute maximum illegal Zapdos’ for sure atleast 100 was needed(all laugh) to get 19(all laugh) and the last will still win the league with a yawn and ask for 4 more choised brats(all laugh)..but still they could be beaten but in Kalos(all laugh) since Crawdauntogator completely and fully unleashed to that maddening tune it’s just the chosen brats(all laugh)..anyway what about the security(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “i made the arrangements with Arthur and Ash’s lineup all knew from before(all laugh) and the match was going on i knew what legends he has and that was only power the real brats were just veiled by that(all laugh) and Arthur strangely looked at me after Kartana won and said,’Misty would only be happy with this man cause her skills alone would make anyone else mere mortal but this man none can surpass atleast in next 500 i guess never saw or heard anything like this in my 58 years(all laugh) and i’m a nut of this since 5(all laugh) and i just hope they get married soon cause after this why travel more(all laugh) just tell them to send the hall of fame go later at leasure in honeymoon with Misty go get any number of brats at will(all laugh)’..and i just smiled whole gym knew about Ash but not what was happening then except Sarah and family who only knew the full thing..does Arthur know the break-in(all laugh)...?”
Ash(laugh) : “well tickling in-charge(all burst into laughter)...well Arthur has only another year and and 5 months or so left here till the last month of next year then he will retire and we all feel so sad for that but the Arthur was laughing saying those two brats if is there no Mewtwos will ever come around(all laugh)...and he at first of course thought Sableye is only after him(all laugh) then that brat hallucinated all with equal number of them with triple number of Sableyes dancing at midnight waking all up(all laugh)..then Sableye forces everyone to reciprocate by tickling him(all burst into laughter)..shows a hallucination to make sure of that(all laugh)..those two disturbed them the whole night(all laugh)..then all realized what sort of pests have taken over the normal ones(all laugh)...all will be sad when they are on holiday BUT(all laugh)..they have no idea what reflection awaits them(all laugh)..by the way today i heard that the brat has also spoiled a certain compatriot of his who want’s to learn about himself form others minutely(all laugh)..all of them too fond of Goldy(all laugh)..both these two brats want to come and i will now have to let them in in this situation so the brats are extorting me(all laugh)...Cerulian City water pokemon gym,Kanto,hall of fame,hosts Garchomp and Dialga(all laugh)...God bless us(all laugh)..but Gary,Gengleye is uniting finally AGIAN with Crawdauntogator(all laugh)”
Gary(laugh) : “yeah,have to leave home(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “well i’ll set the incoming batch upon Marshadow(all laugh)...really man 18 years too long(all laugh)...anyway then Muk in(all laugh)..and i’ve passed my entire career Muking Ash(all laugh) so i was also laughing and then Seismitoad in 2 minutes all done and we all there were happy and all then i came back later told Misty that you’ve won and she just again scoffed and then again had tears saying stuffs and that she wished she never left you and all that...”
Ash(laugh) : “well after Unova finals i only had one thing in my mind,Scyther(all laugh) but definitely not MARILL_MA(all laugh) and of course never STTTi-LLL-eX(all laugh) but also there was Eeee-lect-triv-ite(all burst into laughter)one word though(all laugh)..and atleast Brock and Gary made sure the bunch evolves(all burst into laughter)..and it’s more than 3(all laugh)..well a few of mine refused for the fact that they hated higher forms(all laugh) but the only reason for Scyther not evolving is that he’s working in with a human(all burst into laughter)..and the other two better not be discussed(all laugh)..but Gengleye isn’t returning before 6 months atleast(all laugh)...and i’m so happy now the sections aren’t needed..so sisters any section is similarly Lugiaed now(all laugh)..do you want Xormnuh and Hytostohurakanom as well(all laugh)...and about Mist’s battling style finally(all laugh and .)...Mist is all about being too gracious all time but you see it’s hard for me to see anything other than her frowns and scowls if she’s battling(all laugh)..unless(all laugh) Gyarados(all burst into laughter)...so(all laugh),Mist is extremely gracious in attacks and too good in anticipating the moves of the opponent so she most times doesn’t have to comeback which was ever my trouble cause i never could anticipate and still can’t(all laugh)...of course(all laugh)..anyway,(all laugh)so she doesn’t have to counter most times and thus always seems to be in control as opposite to what i always looked like(all laugh)...right(all laugh),so my failure in anticipating an attack...as yo see(all laugh) was the reason why my bunch became too powerfull in Unova cause against dragons you have to anticipate but i never could my thought process was ‘read and practise the expectations before see the actual during solve later as they come’...so i knew a thousand attacks and all sorts of things more than my opposition did about their own pokemons(all laugh) and that’s why i was so desperate to learn what are other’s strategies cause i never had any(all laugh)...my system was that learn everything before and create an idea of what the concerned pokemon may mean and all the strategies if available means these are also that the pokemon himself told you what to do(all burst into laughter)...still remember once asked Mist,’um..Mist you know of so many ways how the opponent tries to beat your Gyarados does she herself tell you these(all burst into laughter)...so that is why all was about countering cause i knew my bunch to be just like that that they themselves will tell me how they can be beaten(all laugh) and then i’ll tell them what they should do(all burst into laughter)..and that they themselves had to change after one against 10(all laugh)..Crawdaunt actually scoffed me after the match saying i’m not letting him to unlseash(all burst into laughter)..then when after Sinnoh i went there and each they they reached heights that was impossible and eac scoffed later that i was a foolish child(all laugh)..so it was ever like that unless i saw a thing never could anticipate and thank God on that day Chu was reciprocating like that otherwise it would’ve been biggest defeat(all laugh) that 1 beat all 10 unchanged(all laugh)...no really my pokemons forced that in Unova cause they were bored with being at bay against a Metapod(all laugh)...well mine is THE extremley dangerous now as a 3rd class Butterfree(all laugh)..only one to take down a legend name Arsoductyphorus(all laugh) with one line(all laugh),’why are you not me and why am i not you cause we do see each other as different cause only we know ourselves as different thus if i know already the difference that i represent and so do you then is not true that we are ourselves only making this difference that i’m not you and you’re not me but as it’s seen that i’m only me and you’re only you cause i think that you’re not me and you think i’m not you but if i were you and you were me the same thing would’ve happened and we would’ve been different as we see but then with this it is seen all is cause of only we know ourselves as different thus i’m not you and you’re not me but this isn’t true cause i’m still me if i’m you and you’re still you if you’re me then why we bother about this difference at all cause doesn’t it mean that i too am you and you too are me(all burst into laughter and .)’..that was it(all laugh)...this brat infact in 3rd generation has realized the soulmate theory that his grandpa saw being the very first caught(all laugh)..just like Chu but Chu is well behaved(all laugh)...that line and that’s it for the legend asks are you alive(all laugh)..’no i don’t understand this appearing difference of this Butterfree life and your life they seem to be same yet different(all burst into laughter),do you not agree that you’re a Butterfree too cause you’ve created the Butterfree life only to separate yourself and me the same then who you are actually and who am i then and why this difference exists at all..really all do you know why we are(all laugh and .)?’..the legend fled the scene immediately(all laugh) and the master was caught that is one of the 3 legends who themselves went to the pokecentre first thing(all burst into laughter)..Nivy passes whole day with that brat(all laugh) these are true brats in metaphysics and epistemology(all laugh)...and Palkia too(all laugh) but the circular logic was actually caught in an accident just like in Nivy’s case..the other one got the asthetics master Glalie of all(all laugh)..Mist said shouldn’t she return despite my warnings(all laugh) that the brat has long surpassed recoverable insanity(all laugh)..then saw that brat once and told me thank God i never used cosmentics in front of her(all burst into laughter)..legend called Diflogos(all laugh) comes eats her up(all laugh),’Ah,beauty,beauty’(all burst into laughter)...legend thinks that she is eager for a beautiful battle(all laugh)...so charges,’by attacking me what you will get is beautiful but will that be enough for you cause will not it be so that you will ever want more such beauty and thus your constant want of beauty will only increase but will it ever satisfy you enough(all laugh and .)’..this will flatten a human being on the spot(all laugh)..legend with that line realizes the whole picture that she only was creating the whole trouble Glalie did nothing at all to hem or anyone else and by attacking Glalie she is only going after something that she will never get which is peace of pokemind(all laugh)..cause only when she is not attacking or agitated is she peacefull but she will attack anyone if only she is disturbed but she isn’t disturbed by Glalie at all rather she herself is disturbing her very own beautiful peace of beautiful mind(all laugh) as she is unnecessarily turning on innocent philosophers(all burst into laughter)..just asks Glalie to trying to test her resolve that,’ are you in dream,wake up(all laugh)’..cries vigourously(all laugh),’but you said i’m ugly(all burst into laughter)’..legend doesn’t know what to do(all laugh)..then Glalie immediately smiles(all laugh)..,’see i told you we must always only say Ah! beauty,beauty(all laugh)’...that was it legend realizes it’s better to leave this asylum(all laugh)...then finally our honestly ethical Lord(all burst into laughter and .)...Chu’s swron in competitor(all laugh)..who is more well behaved(all laugh)...Lord is too cunning(all laugh)...starts with troubles of fighting(all burst into laughter)...how proper behaviours can make sure nothing happens lectures the legend that is Gofstratocos(all laugh) on how to control the whole world by Lording them by means of ethics(all laugh)..started saying like,’are you the leader of your friends’...you can realize this will make the legend dumbstruck cause this means GuzzLord has disturbed his friends so he is trying to attack which isn’t true at all(all laugh and .)..honesty is a great virtue(all laugh and .)..only if ethically supplimented by proofs(all burst into laughter)..then the ethically honest Lord starts with all sorts of troubles he has seen and thus faced difficulties in his life hindering his pursuit to create the ethical and HONEST life(all laugh uncontrollably) which that itself is an ethical issue(all laugh uncontrollably,tears)...the legend finally said enough i’m leaving,wait wait(all laugh)..are you sure that i myself am right(all burst into laughter and .)...legend fled immediately cause double lecture was coming(all laugh) cause it was the whole GuzzLord race and all kinds of problems which has made ours to TAKE SOME ETHICAL STEPS WHICH THEMSELVES WERE AGAIN EVEN MORE SERIOUS ISUUES OF ETHICS WHICH TOO MUST BE DISCUSSED IN AN ETHICAL NEGOTIATION WITH OTHERS WHICH AGAIN IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS QUESTIONS OF ETHICS BUT NEVER ONLY(all laugh uncontrollably)...this brat is something with all power size and that look(all laugh) and all..what brats those 5 are,whole day this goes on(all laugh)...anyway,so i never learnt about predicting and thus my bunch was fed up and went to a level that made sure they knew their own attacks and weaknesses so so well that they didn’t need to look at the opponent at all now that they were sufficient themselves so save their own back or knew when they can’t at all thus knew all possible minute battling and all kinds of techniques possible for them to use in all possible situations as TYRAniTAR(all laugh) showed during those 2.5 memorable years(all laugh) and then probably became so frivolous that they don’t have to think about anything else at all(all laugh)..that’s almost perfect happiness pokemonsly possible(all laugh)..in pursuit(all laugh)..cause AH,THE BEAUTY(all laugh)..and hence this condition where none knows what this bufoons are to begin with(all smile and .)...so no battle possible(all smile)...Mist is great at anticipating and thus looks so confident against anyone and thus the grace cause also knows how to beat the opponent just perfectly and Daisy was more or less similar too but i think comparing with Mist’s beginning days and given she travelled 5 years at 3 different regions just as if a normal trainer helped her but Daisy was as good then but a bit sentimental(all laugh) cause the jackal was there(all laugh) yeah Daisy had to start around 18/19 and then at 24-26 was just about to go to the next step then enter the human(all laugh) so battling was of course inhuman YET Daisy’s bunch evolved(all laugh) but she fondled her bunch too much(all laugh)...actually Mist was made aware of the art of attacking and all from Daisy VIA the jackal(all laugh)...i provided her the attitude of oblivion only cause before that she was too engaged all the time attacking the opponent and never defending(all laugh)...pretty same with my sis,she was that she was unnecessarily shaky about what to do what not then got that oblivion and battled me all day knew i can’t predict a damn thing(all laugh)..then found her style in her system to think about the next attack while attacking with the current itself by separating herself in that oblivion so her 5 minute blitz became real blitz to others but a 50 minute timespan for her(all laugh)..Mist is about one attack and then knowing what she has done and how it will be countered and then with each passing second looking more and more confident so that itself was a huge headache to the opponent and each moment she smiled to herhelf and all,which of course i only ever saw(all laugh) the rest is heard knowledge(all laugh) that is her mind games but so sweet(all laugh) cause in our last official match i was cursing the whole world as they weren’t letting me hug my better friend(all laugh) who was so sweet just standing opposite to me in her sweet frown(all laugh),too sweet(Ash hugs Misty firmly,Misty same pose hugging Ash firmly and resting her head on his chest,smiles at him) and my sis was about raining in attacks to keep the opponent down constantly thinking of what she can do more to damage more after this and thus totally forgetting the opponent and never needed to even think about countering cause in 5 minutes none will go so mad right from the start(all laugh) and thus selected such brats as Scrafty and Infernape(all laugh) and of course she herself is a Blaziken now(all laugh)..i forced her in all gyms to get time limit as she did to me in a contest(all laugh) but to her apprehension gym battles can’t be fought together(all laugh) and it was hall of fame ground type(all laugh) anyway this was in the midpart of our journey at Hoenn and i wanted to cajole her out of her insecurity with herself cause if with us we chide then will get so dissapointed that we have to fondle our little sis too much(all laugh) so gets in before me loses the 1 on 1 badly for the same reason with then Combusken who was only not evolving as she was herself catching that insecurity in my sis then i after match send her again in time limit playing the gym-leader-uncle card(all laugh) then she is allowed and gets that time limit again loses badly but didn’t panic during the match unnecessarily which she used to and then both me and Brock told her that only she can help her bunch if they are in difficulty during battle cause they are waiting for her orderd and won’t use their own knowledge cause this isn’t a natural fight for them and when they do that they just skirmish and that’s not battle at all so she needs to calm herself down in that platform exactly when her bunch in under plight only then that calmness will help both her and her bunch to regroup and comeback that helped her and she got rid of that shakiness but that was mostly influenced by me cause i was ever in plight(all laugh) and Brock only knew the most obvious things like challenging a Blastoise by takedown(all laugh) his bunch would themselves by their natural resistence take attacks or do the attacks which will buy him the time to judge the opponent(all laugh) and the badge will be there 5 minutes later midmatch(all laugh) and he used Onix to do the same and then gave me the badge but we know each other too well for eternity and knew a certain bug was lurking with great concern just outside the door(all laugh) which she didnt bug through to show her hubby(all laugh) that she was very strict about orders being obeyed(all laugh)..sweet bug(all smile,Ash quickly hugs Misty firmly smiling who smiles at him on the same pose)..so little cute sis later became angry red sis(all laugh) by decimating challengers and in the last few gyms forced herslef before me for 5 minutes(all laugh) and did do all and then in Battle Frontier she couldn’t be allowed so i got the most perfect partner for 8 minute blitz(all laugh) and my cluelessness spoiled the pest even more(all laugh) and influenced 7 red dresses(all laugh) and scarves which in the beginning wasn’t totally red later everything was red(all laugh) even the sleeping bag was(all laugh) told Drew in Johto that she is getting her hair red as well(all laugh) then was scoffed by Drew(all laugh) and her parents and Max taunted her(all laugh) so the pest calmed down(al laugh) but she is good enough to hold her own on any gym certainly if its say against Mist but of course can’t go the distance and those 4 matches of 13 minutes total each and Drew had 3 of same so those total 7 matches during Mist’s confusing years still was refreshing to her so much and i’m so greatfull to both her and Drew for not neglecting their sister-in-law cause the brother was misbehaving with them and thus his wife’s plight and confusion(all smile) but now cajoling the Blaziken is extremely dangerous(all laugh) whole bunch except Blaziken of course(all laugh) has been ordered to not mingle with her and especially her husband for next 2 years(all laugh) though wanted to send them here(all laugh) i said get the hell out of here unless you want to get unemployed with your hubby(all laugh) so it’s going to happen later and i know so many great people that are too eagered and would be honoured and happy to face Mist and i’m arranging a good match each day after a few more months till my whole bunch visits the gym of course(All laugh) after that i’ll be living in my toffee-flower dream for sure(all laugh)...right(all laugh),and that brat shrew was ever too thoughtful(all laugh)...before was so meticulus in defense and planning that forgot to attack at all(all laugh)..the May helped the rose to red up in attack(all laugh) and he got the Torchic down to be more rosey(all laugh) and thus shared everything from title to life all(all laugh)..what a duo that is...so great that no frictions ever arose between them,soulmates for sure(all smile)...but i ever pester them saying why not Unova(all laugh) they said dragons are distastefull except Sheldons(all laugh)..but about my thing they asked i said look kids(all laugh) unless EACH OF YOU you do a grand total of 2500 contests(all laugh) across the world out of which 600 must be in Unova and 460 in Kalos within exactly those many days(all laugh) and still do the other formalities like entering only 2nd rounds in about 1400 places(all laugh) while being undercover(all laugh) with 63 physchics,darks and ghosts around you each to jump on you anytime(all laugh) to either fondle you to death or insinuate to you(all laugh) and still find more than ample time to attend AND PREPARE FOR NEXT 6 university lectures on anatomy(all laugh),you won’t have the right words to say in press cause you won’t be sweared enough(all laugh)..but let’s the lesser one speak whole only jackals by the days(all laugh) on how about a Xormnuh and a Hytostohurakanom to begin with(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “i just want them to find there soulmates on first day of journey(all laugh) but not if in university never(all burst into laughter)...”
Gary(laugh) : “and Gili is starting from Kalos(all laugh)...all your responsibility(all laugh)...but don’t anatomize girls that are 36 years younger to you(all burst into laughter)”
Brock(laugh) : “i have only one thing to say that they will be properly naive(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “thanks for reciprocating(all laugh)...well Munro and Rene congratulates me and all stuffs,Cilan and Iris comes in and all, then i met a few others in the party all were rather silent now after today cause Munro was local and such a great name you know but that day a few brats were roaming around but never came near me cause i was with Muno and others discussing Articuno and Zapdos(all laugh)...then Iris of course took part 4rd round was out and she also discussed a few things with me talked with people and all,Cili was rather relieved to get off away(all laugh)...by then he was so threatened that never mentioned one thing personal for 3 months(all laugh)...well Unova started from the very 0th month cause i got Noivern new young leader kicked out of group for being philosophical(all laugh) jumped on me(all laugh) and you know in the end they settled the dispute still won’t leave me i now ask don’t you want to go back,’kids,those troubles show they are too frivolus for life(all laugh) just that youth(all burst into laughter)’ i flee the scene(all laugh) he didn’t even breed there and then heightened his intelligence cause TYRAniTAR(all laugh) then if i count from 0th month then it’s 32 total and thus from this perspective,1st 2 months only i was calling Mist 7 days as usual she wanted to marry me after Sinnoh so much that couldn’t keep it to herself each time saw me and i was not prepared cause my bunch already married me(all laugh) so i felt bad for her and each day had to pat her back to sleep or restart the gym and she just waited for my call and barely spoke anything about profession or even personal stuffs just kept looking at me and the screen was not there(all laugh) then my brats were going nuts(all laugh) so i told her that it will be 6 she couldn’t say a word against me then and was ok and no for all Daisy’s ideas about me she was absolutely right on the fact that all i needed to do was to taunt her enough to send Mist to me for a week(all laugh) that would’ve been enough to show her what the brats were upto but it never occured to me and that’s why we’re such a unique family as well these strategies work in normal relations never for us(all laugh) cause AH!INHUMAN!(all laugh)..so then next 4 became 6 then next 5 became 5 next 5 became 4 and after that next 5 was thrice and troubles were serious then next 4 it was twice and then the next three was only once and then in the last month before final i spoke with Mist thrice and had big quarrels there and other time was with Trace and that was it really..and in the final month there was no contact except Trace and that was all...so on the final night i only called Professor and Mom and Gary called me saying weather is good,ship is trembing(all laugh)...Brock was so busy with his schedule and stuffs not much,Trace was trying to be a fox(all laugh),at which he once more succeeded(all laugh)..saying that he’ll CONNECT(all laugh) me to Daisy(all burst into laughter)...i said mate,connect to Lillie cause she’s easier to bait(all laugh)...with Magikarps(all laugh)..how’s that starter(all laugh)...”
Lillie(laugh) : “i’ll start dealing with Mime(all laugh)”
Ash(laugh) : “most welcome(all laugh)..then Daisy calls and gravely just says that Mist is hurt and all and i just bipassed it with best wishes(all burst into laughter)...then mom says,’Ash,have you rejected Mist,she didn’t..’,’come home but it’s ok mom,i’ve just been away for long will go and talk and no she’s as ever you know my only longing in personal life so it’s ok’,’i see,do me a favour,don’t come home at all(all laugh)..stay there for the next year then go wherever you want(all laugh)’...anyway that goes(all laugh),Harris calls,’Ash,i know all but just don’t leave for the next soon,stay in the gym for some months atleast and you know more than anyone that you already are a Master it’s a matter of formality’,’yeah,man i’ll see,i’ll see’...then finally after all gets dissapointed,’yeah just don’t create a fuss here(all laugh)..marry her,settle down send Kalos Elite4 and all rest a post that you can’t be present please send titles and the hall of Fame acknowledgement(all laugh) to Cerulian City gym.’ then Kane as usual says you have to date everyday now and it’s not an allegation(all laugh)..Tony said i ever told you pests are too much in Cerulian and then the show is too much so immediately give her all the ghosts you have(all laugh),his psychotic sweetie agryily added(all laugh),’what’s the point if ghost and psychic and dark difference persists(all laugh)’ i said Tony what’s the other(all laugh),’yeah yeah,enough with your tests(all laugh) and Olivia says,testing others and forgetting own fairy(all laugh) straight runaway with her to unknown islands,bye(all laugh)..then Irene never spoke of these matters but did say Mist is very depressed i said just a good vacation with me away was alright then(all laugh) and Braum wisely pointed out how a girl can from being little irritated to totally reject her boyfriend by exactly which actions to how much degree and in what kind of circumstances in 30 minutes(all burst into laughter) i said mate except for you none stood 30 minutes at general cup final against my Hawlucha,Noctowl and Buzzwole(all laugh),’yeah yeah too much glee(all laugh) my poor Torandus(all burst int laughter),Talonflame and Sigilyph(all laugh) and yeah Noctowl drew only with Talonflame(all laugh) AND THAT BRAT HAWLUCHA BEAT TORANDUS AFTER 15 MINUTES(all laugh) but i’m sure i would’ve got anyone that day even after Torandus cause Talonflame got Hawlucha in less than a second(all laugh) then draw was strage to me and still took 8 minutes(all laugh) then till i was confident but Sigilyph said Buzzwole asked me during climax along with the attack please review my answer my master asked me to identify that in the sudden intuition to the review process the acts of will vs spontaneity(all burst into laughter) and my answer is yeah like when after sometimes you want to do something but just think that enjoyment might help the process eventually which is the trap cause enjoyment appears only if only isn’t enjoying hence that word is self contradictory isn’t it(all burst into laughter) this was just after those new translators came up behind which the actual mastermind was no other absolute pest than exactly you(all laugh) and i got this translation(all laugh) i realized that day you’re a perfect defintion of an
in-born pest(all laugh) and psycho too agreed(all laugh),’see Braumy still so much reminiscences after 10/11 years from that day(all laugh) and you have yourself a damn Salamence man(all laugh)’,’Ash just beat it don’t waste my time marry your lunatic Gyarados and don’t be seen again alive cause she’s absolutely famished,bye(all laugh)..’ then May was as usual never took anyone’s side just ever told me to clam down and think well before doing anything and ever sympathised with Mist no matter what mood she was in and then even kept contacts enough without my presence as well till i had to say those being a retard,Drew a bit more dissapointed but still same and they had serious problems themselves then just starting their 3rd journey and pests were at them as well due to 2 back to back draws being travel companions and quite a few shared ribbons..so these were going on but i knew my bunch now much calmed down and all..so i bought the ring and came back straight didn’t tell anyone cause all knew(all laugh)...first i enter a few words then first hurdle is again Daisy(all laugh)...anyhow wish her away(all laugh)...then Lillie conspired so that they had a show exactly on that day at Grumsborg,Hoenn(all burst into laughter)..anyway Daisy was at her unjackald self(all laugh) and set the jackal on me for the day(all burst into laughter)...,’Misty cried for 4 minutes 54 seconds(all laugh)..Misty cried looking at your picture for 10 minutes 54 seconds,out of which sobbing amounts to this(all burst into laughter)’..’just give me the litres(all burst into laughter)’...then comes Sarah,’Misty is very..’,’upset that gym isn’t running well(all laugh)’...not another word(all laugh)..then reservation there’s Brauch,’Ash,why would you..’,’i haven’t right?’(all laugh) not another word but strangely a balanced man jumps on me now with his Tapu Koko(all laugh)...’Ash,i’m alright but a few men look good..(all uncontrollably laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing)..’,’Gary please,calm down set youself and Tapu Koko upon Cloyster and Goldy(all laugh) just go off don’t bother about that type(all burst into laughter)’ then Daisy is gym battling and by then all her bunch is too sweetened(all laugh) and thus the result(all laugh)...i tell her take Seismitoad(all laugh)...’why don’t you do the honours’(all laugh)...well get in generally it’s just 3 hours for each challenge if a full 3 on 3 and thus there will be only 3 such if such cases appear otherwise it takes 1(all laugh) thus 6 challengers(all laugh) and their travel companions if they want..so then i,my only experience with absolute hell(all laugh)...had to be a gym leader(all laugh,.,cheer) against an absolute brat(all laugh)...a dumped non-female version(all laugh)...comes in acts as if doesn’t know me cause all knew me by then to be sanely safe for another day(all laugh),’um..Ms Misty..(all laugh)..’...’on vaction,SIR(all laugh)’...still asks,’um..you’(all laugh)...’Ash Ketchum,Pokemon Trainer,speciality of starter thunder-chair(all laugh) at your service SIR(all laugh) this DUTY(all laugh) is due to familial relations,SIR(all burst into laughter),cause i happen to be 7 region 5 league chamipon with the just concluded Unova league title SIR(all burst into laughter),but please make yourself comfortable(all burst into laughter) and express your needs to me,SIR(all laugh),so that i may know that how may i come in any insignificant help to your career(all burst into laughter),please sir,allow my Seismitoad to serve you according to your wish(all burst into laughter)...’um..it’s alright Mr Ketchum,your Seismitoad was the last one to..um..(all burst into laughter),i’ll come later(all laugh)’...went away cause if thunder-chair wasn’t enough comes in humility chair(all laugh) while is human level speciality(all laugh) so no pokemons will come to any help(all laugh) thus Seismitoad one was offered to him to moderate the process of surpassing the idea with knowledge(all laugh) and i told Daisy that that’s why you should keep a Thundurus(all laugh)...anyway,then i learn the chart,which i never thought existed in 6 years(all laugh)...Ms Misty Waterflower,water show performer..i told Sarah,wait isn’t she the gym leader(all laugh)..’Ash,these are the real issues that you neglected’(all laugh)...anyway goes on..Ms Lillie Waterflower,water show performaer and her tours and first time ever i came to know Lillie has travelled Unova more than once(all laugh)...the chart is,in the last 8 years after their world tour which then didn’t include Sinnoh now,31 Johto Tours-124 shows,62 weeks..i still remember cause i was paperslammed by Violet(all laugh)...
Hoenn,23 Tours+1-92+1 shows,except current 46 weeks,Sinnoh-17 tours-68 shows,34 weeks,Orange,21 tours-84 shows,42 weeks,Kanto(all laugh),40 tours-160 shows,80 weeks,then finally Unova,3 tours-12 shows,6 weeks(all cheers and .s for Lillie)..i was suspicious that is it the same person(all laugh)...that’s 270 weeks of touring around the world and having 4 months average break per year for 8 years from the age of 26 to 34 that’s incredible body of work done by a gym leader for sure who still did battle no matter what(all laugh) and still had to bear with a Mr Oak Mr Oak who was saying wait the proposal must be of that type(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) but still there was a jackal(all laugh) anyway,now Ms Violet Waterflower,but i can’t count that(all laugh)...every show that Lillie was there and then triple on that(all cheer for Violet)...i guess Violet’s work was 2 months break per year(all laugh)..so add 8 weeks for 8 years 64 weeks and still the excess days total 4*8 is 32 say 35 and may be even 42 but say 35 thus adding 5 total 69 weeks on top of Lillie’s 270 weeks thus in average in each region 11 more shows or was her own performances and actually it was almost all except Unova so in average 13 more shows at 5 regions and 4 may be extra at Unova and 2 months break..i said yeah Kommo-O said life is hard(all laugh)..Violet have you ever thought of performances inside Huntelion or with Kommo-O in the building(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “Huntelion i will go and you will get the brats to listen to HUMANS(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “most welcome(all laugh),but the human will have to be there at sometime for sure(all laugh)..anyway,Ms Daisy Waterflower..’um..i’ve ever wondered why a certain budding researcher would want to perform in shows...please move along..(all laugh)’..so Daisy did out of Mist’s average 38 weeks per year work and her own 14 Daisy did 15 week tours so total 120 weeks hence the jackal got a leeway(all laugh) as he was 24 weeks out himself(all laugh) and Mr Oak Mr Oak for 12(all laugh) the rest 18 the two were together when my brats went to their absolute absolute(all laugh) well each month atleast for one week both were together that is(all laugh) then Daisy never went to Sinnoh or Unova of all places of course(all laugh) majority at Kanto,Hoenn and Orange and of course all cause of the Saturday night in house show at Cerulian(all laugh) which was Mist flower’s den infact(all laugh) mind the tense(all laugh)..now she’s her majesty Mrs Misty Ketchum(all laugh)...right(all laugh),so now comes Ms Misty Waterflower,water show performer,position mermaid(all laugh)..i already started preparing Hoopa(all burst into laughter) with Aegislash(all laugh) those two got just jovial so kept them there at the door to shut out the in and outflow(all laugh)..now i knew the few shows and all, especially Johto and Hoenn,Sinnoh never did when i was there and Unova she has been to once when i was at Sinnoh...thus it goes...last,6 years,Johto-7 tours-28 shows,Orange-6 tours-20 shows,Kanto-7 tours-36 shows,Hoenn-5+1 Tours-24+1 shows,Sinnoh-4 tours-12 shows,finally Unova-1 tour 4 shows..all of which my dear Cili saw(all laugh) and as did his soulmate ever better Jeniffer ever lesser Cili(all laugh) well those were after i broke-up actually(all laugh) not the ones mentioned here but those damn brats couldn’t find any other GARDENS(all laugh)...great,then comes a Mr jackal(all burst into laughter)...Mr jackal was wickedly dating under the sly VEIL of uncanny HANGOUTS(all burst into laughter,.) VIA 4th cousins(all laugh)cunningly(all laugh) with laid down years(all burst into laughter)...so in last 7 years, a Mr Fox, Johto-2 tours,1 show,Hoenn,1 tour-no show(all laugh),Kanto,No tours,apprehension of abject failure to reciprocate the days on the days and thus personal defamation(all burst into laughter)...but of course there’s Orange(all laugh),2 tours-No shows,too much tropical vegetation(all laugh)...so the fox was now VEILING Professor Oak(all laugh) by telling him(all laugh)...’um..Ash,Tracey is too(all laugh)...’,’um,no professor just wants to marry the eldest Waterflower sister can’t say(all laugh) and neither does she so an emotion(all laugh)...’..Professor Oak is once ever got the whole picture(all laugh) said himself better and best wishes(all laugh)..this is 10 years before your marriage(all laugh)..no i’m sorry but i never had the chances to un universalize(all laugh)...so please,ALLOW me(all laugh)...,’um..Ash..Gary is good but a gym..(all laugh)..’..’um..no Professor it’s just that the Cerulian City Gym is a difficult place indeed(all laugh)...you know about Mist’s Golduck,i told you about Trace before,but one of the sisters is Lillie as you know..the rest is well..about pre settlement emotions(all laugh)...’ again not one more word and just said that yeah like concentrated family(all burst into laughter)...this is 8 years before your marriage(all laugh)...and(laugh) in the next term i will at 16 but you should too next year get married(all laugh) and by-the-way none asked me why am i interested about a certain Mist flower(all laugh) it was ever that why i’m not telling the word that she’s my wife(all laugh)...because the other lessers were cunningly naive(all laugh)...so they unnecesseraily tried to HIDE(all laugh) but still in the end all had to CONFIDE(all laugh)...when the betters said you better ABIDE(all laugh,.)...then,my flower was most Gyaradosy(all laugh)..so herself jumped on me(all laugh)..Lillie wig was all about wigs that Gary Oak of all people had to be personal it requires one to be subtle(all laugh) so took some more time and and then there is most honoured Mrs Violet Slate,who only had to wait cause her other half is a crook(all laugh) crook was obviously trying to eavesdrop other couples like his travel companions to learn the art of PROPER married life(all burst into laughter)...yeah May was 10 years younger to him was asking her,’um..you’re just above 19,he too why are you two not getting married yet(all laugh) Mr and Mrs Maple married young(all burst into laughter)..’ to which our sister rebuked him(all laugh) saying Drew didn’t propose properly for 15 minutes(all laugh) YET(all laugh) which according to her interpretation of Mrs Maple was to be done to become more that better friends(all laugh) and final marriage takes 30(all laugh) and to befriend May,Drew required 5 minutes(all laugh) so the crook was watered down by HIS WHOLE FAMILY(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) and then our DaivyDaisyl(all laugh)...no dealing with an once ever university dreaded human jackal(all laugh) isn’t easy so they took the second cousin mask beyond marriage(all laugh)...and about me it was too easy(all laugh) first i learnt 999 ulterior ways VIA own self created ideas(all laugh) that FEELING(all laugh) then go out first travel in a jungle the first human i meet is my wife(all laugh) who slapped me(all laugh) cause i called her ‘mam(all burst into laughter)...right(all laugh),and the one week mandatory that Lillie was at the gym to battle TWO FULL DAYS OR ONE AS IT CAME(all laugh) and then the one month continuous break then Mr Oak Mr Oak was so naive(all laugh) anyway lets go back to the illusive 4 years,now Sarah goes on with these lists showing the water show schedule,i realized that it’s very difficult but i thought that well it’s just their wish and that’s all it’s not something mandatory..so i was fine even after 2.5 years of Cili(all laugh) but i realized that,60 weeks in 6 years indeed is hard cause lets be Goodra(all laugh),312 weeks in total out of which 60 is off so we’re left with 247 weeks and Ms Misty Waterflower has taken including the two breaks with her hubby(all laugh) has taken 9+15 total 24 weeks break in last 6 years thus worked for 228 weeks in 6 years which means exactly 38 weeks a year she was the Gym leader and battled and got the nomination for first special gym was back three years ago and second phase of special Gym completed already a year ago completing the minimum 8 years and also the minimum 35.75 weeks/year ratio just marginally(all laugh)..the other times were compensated by Daisy 15 weeks and Lillie did the rest 1 or 2 days per year(all laugh) so i was asking Sarah that why doesn’t Mist take breaks(all laugh) then she scoffs that Mist is my girlfriend i should’ve forced her to take rest and so on i said yeah i don’t take breaks either(all laugh)..then she again flew off detecting the suspicious movements of 300 gyms stories with dragons in 72 competitions(all laugh)..but later i gave her a chart on Mist’s vacations(all laugh)...a Mrs Delia Ketchum,who has one pokemon,a Mr Mime,’Ash,i know your mom well enough(all laugh)’..no no please allow me(all laugh)..was trying to flee,at the door Hoopa was kept(all laugh)..so budges(All laugh)...gravely returns and says i see psudeo-legendary thirst has spoiled you(all burst into laughter)..i said well mutual quenching(all laugh) but now start,so a Mrs Ketchum,mom of a Ash Ketchum has spent 70 days in last 5 years at this gym thus it means,each year 2 weeks(all laugh),now Ms Misty Waterflower in last 5 years has spent 46 days of her 15 weeks vacation at the home of this Mrs Ketchum(all laugh)...which is each year 9.2 days that is 9 days 4 hours 48 minutes(all burst into laughter),THUS it can be deduced that she’s my girlfriend for a very very long time if not more(all burst into laughter)...,’Ash,let me off,don’t make a fuss with that Hoopa(all laugh)..she’s dejected for long with your INHUMAN(all laugh) 300 hall of fame gyms and 72 competitions(all laugh) that too in Unova in 912 total days(all laugh) and you brought 19 from there with 15 dragons including a Giratina,Latios,Zekrom,Reshiram,Garchomp,Dialga,Goodra,Hydreigon,Rayquaza,Kyurem and Palkia(all laugh) still this doesn’t include the Hoopa that is may be just behind me now(all laugh)..Hoopa and Aegislash blinks in front of her(all burst into laughter)..YEAH!THIS IS WHY!(all laugh) NOT ONE BUT TWO!(all laugh) THIS IS WHY YOU’RE THIS(all laugh)..and you have 16 ghosts in total with ALWAYS TWO LURKING AROUND YOU(all laugh) SINCE HOENN(all laugh) and still expect a girl to talk with you(all burst into laughter)..just marry her take her out for honeymoon WITHOUT GHOSTS AND NOT ON DRAGONS CAUSE YOU’RE A 5 TIME CHAMP WITH WORLDWIDE DREADED NAME(all burst into laughter) THUS RICH ENOUGH FOR HIGHER ECONOMY CLASS,BYE(all laugh)..’,’just a sec Sarah,i still don’t have a Kommo-O(all burst into laughter) and also an Ultranercozma(all laugh) and also i forgot to mention that Ms Misty Waterflower has also learnt a bit of cooking at that vacation place(all burst into laughter)...’..so no words flew off excosrted by Hoopagislash(all laugh)..well finally one dragon will be in and what a one to have at a water gym(all laugh)..so was off,then finally Brock calls and says again marry Mist but she’s very hurt and all...then anyway,i call Mist finally after ages(all laugh)...first doesn’t pick up(all laugh) text..still remember that text and conversation some bits very short it was but what i got then and what actually she meant(all laugh),so doesn’t pick up after first trial then second same result(all laugh) text,’i so much liked your movements around me ever sweetie,look at me(all laugh)’ so then finally text comes,say won’t receive(all laugh),’yeah new marriage shame of the everold(all laugh)’..then was irritated enough(all laugh) and namecalled me(all laugh) so i knew that’s the green signal(all laugh)..right(all laugh),so then i call,’Hellow Mist,no answer just a sigh(all laugh),Mist please you know i’m waiting for you dear(all laugh),yeah i know DEAR(all laugh) what are the deamands(all laugh),your ponytail(all laugh),Ash i’m busy UNLIKE YOU(all laugh) and ponytails huh ponytails,ponytails(all laugh) those,anyway(all laugh),why are you not in Kalos already(all laugh),cause i’m at my wife’s room at Cerulian(all laugh) please,dear just return immediately i want to make the marriage official as soon as you’re here(all laugh),yeah finally after all these years wisdom dawns(all laugh) why didn’t those,anyway(all laugh) just what do you want(all laugh),Mist listen sweetie i just want to see you here with me and no i’m without pokemons this time(all laugh),huh!pokemons,pokemons(all laugh) just get off(all laugh),then asked her fine just tell me when she’s returning and says will be two weeks later(all laugh) cuts off..i feel bad cause i don’t have ages as i also had to run to Kalos in 3 or 4 months if not settled here to test that the brats have really cooled down and that joviality is permanent(all laugh)..i text Lillie cause Mist might’ve blocked me by now(all laugh)...text,’KALOS CALLING KUDOS KETCHUM(all laugh)’...that was enough for my sweet Gyarados to ponytail up and return(all laugh)...right(all laugh),cause neither she nor her older-Cloyster-lioness-sister(all laugh) will budge from a not not male(all laugh) being Crabominables(all burst into laughter) and then it had to be Violet who was the director(all laugh) and the not not male had to be none other than Ketchum(all laugh)...plus they have a dangerous in-house backup(all laugh) and to increase that(all laugh),there’s a living dictionary of wickedness(all laugh) plus now the jackal has company in a balanced man(all laugh),who if gets unbalanced then will mingle with pokemons(all laugh)...now at night call comes Mist flower,who obviously was very dejected and all then throughout next two days i’m transitioning from FRONTCOVER-BOY to UNDERCOVER-BOY(all laugh and .)...and the confused-flower is transitioned into one and only salt-flower(all laugh and .)...just a sec..(all laugh)...
[Ash(smile,hugging Misty very firmly) : “hum..sweetie,i’m eating you up,you’re so sweetie”
Misty(smiles at Ash,hugging him firmly,then resting her head on his chest) : “just as you Ash,my sweetie,forever”(Ash smiles hugs for a few moments and then tenders Misty)]
right too sweetend today(all smile)...so,my flower then says that she’ll return and all and Violet of course was there who tames the lioness feeding the expression of balanced professionality in wigged freedom card which is appreciated by impersonal husbands(all burst into laughter,Lillie and Violet uncontrollbaly laugh and Gary shakes his head laughing)...so my flower is back 5 days later,in the meantime i’m kicked out of the gym(all laugh) no Daisy doesn’t do these with her own paws(all laugh)...a Mr Cunning slyly tells me to go home cause my bunch is misbehaving(all laugh) showing evidences 6 months old(all burst into laughter)...but how’s the state of mutual balance now Mr and Mrs Skechit(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “Mr has been directed to mingle in imaginary legal and all sorts of other problems to get himself frustrated to trap me(all laugh) such as he can’t spend more time with fire types due to my patronizing nature(all burst into laughter) so now i do his pawing work(all laugh) really this pest has upended my personal life(all laugh) in persuit of revenge(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “the imaginary matters are served by Zara of course(all laugh) who is fed to her husband by means of too caring about the whole world except him cause all he is too interested about is profession(all laugh) reverse work to poor Drew(all laugh) and those two new pests and peronally moling to feed the master brat these professional ideas(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “that’s why Boulder is so fond of us(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs)..no really one thing is to fool around but getting the whole family involved(all laugh)..”
Brcok(laugh) : “Misty,don’t get so upset when he calls you so(all burst into laughter)..”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “shut up!(all laugh) else i’ll teach anatomy to Foster(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “that will be the end of employement of any kind for the rest of Brock’s life(all laugh)..so you see countering(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “yeah i’ll feed Zekrom with ideas then(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “what’s her type(all burst into laughter)..”
Brock(laugh) : “yeah then i’ll sabotage your bunch(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “naively(all burst into laughter)..anyhow then during that time after Unova the professional too needs company there otherwise he anyhow is standing two weeks longing(all laugh) now unless he’s kept in balance he’ll himself imbalance my bunch(all laugh),which then consisted of blood thirsty brats who became so powerful that infighting was the only way to appease them(all laugh)..that’s another story Gary and Trace know too well(all laugh)..Gray TYRAniTAR..(all laugh)..and Trace SCRAFTI(all laugh)..am i not your family cause you’re dual so happy and sad(all burst into laughter)..legend same realized that this brat is trying to enter his family by means of metaphysics(all burst into laughter) fled the scene immediately(all laugh)..both now even more dangerous(all laugh)..so i come back via Noivern,who needed certain beings(all laugh)...so i stay with my bunch and see them and all Crawdauntogator scoffs at me saying now they are way more powerfull that i’m not battling them(all laugh) and Bulbasaur says the same and all i had an intuition now that they really are taking me as their equal and thus always wants me among themselves and you know what it means when 2 pokemons knowing heightens their powers for you thus sacrificing breeding powers and they themselves first say we want to unleash and then themselves actually SCOFF yeah that was their attitude all of them same even Bulbasaur soffs that they truely are more powerfull now being away from me not battling and yet sacrificing natural insticts cause their master is being the word CHILDISH that he isn’t again the word AGREEING to them..this was their attitude(all smile) like big brothers were scoffing little bro and Chu only got the leeway thus(all laugh)...and so i was there and now my flower comes back,jackal goes out for another hunting for 7 days(all laugh) so does the professor now i return there,Daisy is now called Daivysyl(all burst into laughter) who has now send the day beyond dusk(all laugh) Noctowling the whole procedure(all laugh) cunningly driving the fox away beyond reach cause he calls disturbingly(all uncontrollably laugh)...so now in the gym Daisy with her two obvious lackies(All laugh) are lurking around(all laugh) and now my flower is in there,i was there for 7 days,we went to 3 dates didn’t go well,screamed at me last day at Pearl’s for which Pearl’s had to serve 10 days no renumeration though VIA City Authority itself(all laugh)..just told the Bernetur prefixes,gladly co-operated(all laugh)...the dates and all here was just why i don’t like her(all laugh) and i infact tried to do everything politely later 4 years little stern and that’s it so much tears once thinks she’s not my Mist(all laugh) ‘Ash,your..your..new girlfriend..your..(all laugh)’..right(all laugh),then the Cape,then i forced her one day to finally say what is the trouble now that i’m saying i’m back for a year atleast and saying and i’ll marry you..but then as according to play,marriage was alright but again i had to say one year and atleast so my flower is very upset and all that then we have first skirmish and then second and finally third i was again ordered to not be at Cerulian and all total 25 days and done..i passed an hour after the illusion at the certral battlefield,DaivyDaisyl cunningly wasn’t present on the scene(all laugh)...Gary’s wig called me(all laugh)...said with good language(all laugh) that it’s better to not get my feathers of relativity onto her(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs)..both the sisters had Giratina to hold them back while i spoke the final words with their husbands(all laugh)..but the fox being so still tried to jackle around late night(all laugh)..anyway,i’ll tell these in details cause this part hasn’t been laughed at for long which i want to cause it was so funny to me it seems now so another night or noon may be(all laugh)..anyway,then i come back do what i do and went straight to Safforn cause i had to have long discussions with Sabrina and Melody as well...then i finally start my hellrounds in the meantime contacted the gym once just before going to undercover for no reason actually reflex action Garchomp was in the process of getting that then(all laugh) and at gym none was there and so on...all this takes around 10 weeks and then i have 1 week i was all with my Psychic and ghosts at Safforn forest each day for 7 days and all..yeah all ghosts know me(all laugh)...and all this was happening and yeah undercover was in my ears as well but i wasn’t approached and then they approached me and then i get prepared then all the wills and all,just had a provision that if my flower hasn’t moved on from me at all,just to tell her...Professor was trusted on this cause i knew that the gym may do away with all except Gary Oak and Tracey Skechit cause they can’t get any better in this world and also Gary was to tell my mom just like this one as you know but the jackal isn’t trusted on GROSS matters but EMOTIONAL ones(all laugh) and the professor is the exact opposite(all laugh)...for the combination but with the danger of naivety(all laugh) available is a Crook(all laugh) with a certain kind of unbribed Steelix(all laugh)...
so basically from now till Demonboy beginning after undercover it’s all about you..lets start with Violet..”
Violet(laugh) : “well for me just one line the greatest caring husband is now the biggest infatuated man(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “same for me one line,so happy to cunningly get rid of Egochum(all burst into laughter)”
Gary(laugh) : “well same for me,just one line, Unnesseciate the Necessary if the Necessity is Subtle Enough..once ever stuff really..told grandpa later(all laugh)...,’hmm..(all laugh)...Mistyfied...hmm..’(all laugh)...”
Lillie(laugh) : “i have a lots of lines to say really(all laugh) first as i said i was surprized then the magazines(all laugh)..and i’m here now for 4 years and realize i would’ve done the same in both cases of you and Mist(all laugh) and also all else exactly including me(all laugh) hence,before going into it to strenghten the words,Viol what is the most stricking feature of the first sight(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing)..”
Violet(laugh) : “i went there for performace 2 days after my birthday next day entered the gym for no reason at all(all laugh) Violet Waterflower,Cerulian City Gym,2nd Waterflower sister,come in come in come in(all laugh) so mom allowed me in and then saw the leader there(all laugh) who was leading for 2 months only(all laugh)..i became most cause of the projection of course(all laugh) but what is that the very thought of this MAN that makes anyone..(all laugh)..”
All in Unison,except Brock(laugh) : “AH!THIS FEELING! JUST SO NAIVE!(all brust into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing)..”
Brock(laugh) : “should’ve abducted Viol and straight got out of profession(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “and just 13 months later i put my first step at Pewter and heard this Oracle,AH!BOULDER!BOULDER!(all burst into laughter)..and this occured to me in that type of naive voice(all burst into laughter)”
Lillie(laugh) : “Mr Oak Mr Oak why is called voice(all burst into laughter)..”
Gary(laugh) : “no man,this pest Zeraora was minutely taught to ruin me(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “AH!that feeling(all laugh),no we were at the gym Ketchum comes first time Ash Ketchum,Pallet Town,Pokemon Master(all laugh,Ash shakes his head laughing)..but after that it was just so naive(all laugh)..anyway,i was fed 10 years to that type of way(all laugh) so i was very surprized at the beginning phases during Unova and then was angry and then just realized Mist better get off(all laugh) and then message comes(all laugh)...pokes me as well cause knew i was always with Mist and would also work as her henchwoman(all laugh) plus well actually Ketchum is still mingling with my balanced lion(all laugh)...but to my utmost delight my balanced man becomes totally unbalanced whenever i want to now(all laugh) so then i returned and knew the stuffs and all and didn’t know which way to sail cause Mist inside was all about Ash as ever..but then this break-up incident really opened my eyes as to the fact that i was 34 and not 20 anymore cause that’s where i was before and had to now think about family and all and now Mist’s influence really saturated in me but it pained me after 8/9 months well i still recall she took two months off completely till July after the break-up then we heard about the swearing in ceremony inducting Brock and Trace(all laugh) and then Mist made up her mind and the few shows at Unova though still(all laugh) and then master brat sneaked under the cover with Crawdauntogator(all laugh) then till the month you came out she continued but her vitality was just being drained out of her and then finally next year March end Crawdauntogator comes out and we come to know where you were for 8 months finally(all laugh) and then your antics at press(all laugh) the reasons that forced you to that showed it’s exact opposite form to us(all laugh) then still you sweared at the whole world and stromed off to Kalos(all laugh) while Gary and Trace used to say all money driven here sponsors say he’s incensed with everything including being called Mr or Ash or Mr Ketchum or even the full name as well(all laugh) and infact Mist still thought of reconcilation sometimes during the absence but after undercover-returned Ketchum scoffed at everyone just gave up(all laugh) and then again took a month break in April and man i still remember first press and we all know that have the copy right here cause knew this would be needed(all laugh) so next day news comes congrats Mr Ketchum,Crawdauntogator that is(all laugh) my colleagues that is,the people who saw the light that is,the honest life they must absolutely be given a chance to live again that is,each of my pokemons present here or at my starter lab that is,my starter lab that is,the finances i’ll churn at some other people’s cost that is(all laugh),and all of that should go back to them BUT ONLY VIA ME THAT IS MY LAB that is(all laugh),i will leave for next region immediately as soon as my contract allows me to two months later that is(all laugh),i refuse this childish behaviour of attributing hall of fames to an unworthy person like me whoose pokemons by the best grand luck is too powerful which is known to the whole world hence i don’t deserve it unofficially without earning it by the traditional exsisting way that is(all laugh),my personal life will not be personal anymore that sure is(all laugh),hence the idea of my gender will be refoisted upon me that is(all laugh),each of my colleagues there and most especially Mr David Duncun must get this hall of fame with another if he decides to journey and then qualify for the honour that is,the reason is he wasn’t chosen like me to handle a chosen set of pokemons like me that is(all laugh),but his personal life will be attempted upon as a sample of undercover and subsequent sentimental novelesque drama that is(all laugh),which if happens will only prove that the covered world is the protector and nurturer only to what’s under it that is(all laugh),this name and all is an infringement to my mental well being if it crosses the limit that it did during Unova and will do again after an hour from now that is(all laugh),my bunch might be terminated cause i’ll open Team Rocket 2 that is(all laugh),there will be endeavours to sabotage everything and everyone associeted with me including my bunch to certify me as the new king of pokemon poachers that is(all laugh),but finally and most importantly the idea of starship pain will continue to gnaw at my sanity till the last day of my current psychophysical existence THAT SURELY IS(all laugh) with the addition that many Corpishs and Totodiles will be killed for obvious reasons of simulation by both labs and LEGAL training that too is(all laugh),thank you for your patience i don’t take questions out of direct profession nor when i’m not in the mood which exactly shows you that i want privacy to be sane that i won’t get due to this exact line if not the preeceeding ones but anyway,thanks again(all laugh)..this was just the beginning though(all laugh) then 3 or 4 more was even more incensed at those(all laugh) then Crawdauntogator was tested and totally destroyed everything there including HUMAN sanity(all laugh),we came to know the impossible joviality that is looming now(all laugh) and this all within just one month and a few more days(all laugh) and these all made sure Mist atleast doesn’t leave Cerulian anymore(all laugh) she just said that abstruse method has come into fruitation taking him away from me(all laugh) and she then was in gym leading and did the house-shows for sometimes but all that grace and skill that Misty Waterflower gym leader and water show performer exuded and that self exuberenece her real nature infact was slowly eroding away just because her Ash wasn’t there and this made me understand what you really meant for her since the very first day and also all other things became even more clear from my own life and perspective and views and then finally i recognized my soulmate and all..but we stopped the international tours by the next month after you came out of undercover,Viol naively settled in Viridian of course(all laugh) and Dase herself was in a very dejected state due to foxing movements(all laugh) and you were doing what your bunch told you to at Kalos then(all laugh) and then in the next 6/7 months just the in-house stuff till October or November me and Mist did and where Mist was just dragging herself and then just went off and i continued another 1 or 2 months with Dase just till the year end and that really was it we officially called it off but the real on running curtain call is brilliantly going(all laugh) and anyway,then i also stopped at year end and next year within just 6 months later in June me and Gary realized our relation and then after engagement on August,got married in October ,which was unnecessary expenditure though as it turned out to be(all laugh) and came here at the lab permanently from October itself and this life was what really was for me looking after pokemons to be looked after by the same though(all laugh) in a way that’s not really welcome for all except me actually(all laugh) and then from September to December the Frucient trouble was there then in March jackal finally jumped out of bush with erected years(all laugh) so Dase got engaged to jackal finally in May as well(all laugh) before this in November the naivety was settled finally as well(all laugh),so infact we three were so happy with our lives yet so sad cause of Mist’s unbearable plight and then i was rather strangely and most cruelly at the cost of my baby sis been catapulted to the life for which i’ve come here this term and Mist i still remember cried so much the day i finally moved out of the gym and i too was in profuse tears and Gary,Dase,Tracey all managed me and Mist that day..so i’ve actually given the depressed flower aspect too and all the time it was for her just about trying to forget you after the time 5/6 months when you were undercover she tried to reconcile but again wasn’t sure or rather just didn’t know what was happening around her...and i’m so happy to see the show as well as i know would be the fans cause this really was real and you two did do justice to everything and that’s all...but again all this was one side,Lugia another plane(all laugh)...Ketchum,if legal procedures start you’ll become salted(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “balancedly agreed(all laugh)...”
Tracey(laugh) : “well my time was too hard(all laugh) may be hardest well Brock was straight thrown into volcano and without a quote too(all laugh) i atleast had the quote(all laugh) and then i also was all over the place with undercover and that brat of a bunch(all laugh) and then my own career was at the last lap 1.5 years was left since the time this pest went in pursuit of Eloquence at our cost(all laugh) and then it took so many years cause these brats are like that(all laugh) and all so i was extremely busy and all but why i say my time was hard was because i had to talk with the demonboy each day almost(all laugh)..just the reports and all and was calling by surnames and all that(all laugh) then i go for my final presentations and etc they say how do you know these things like this even we don’t know so clearly that’s the 40% we know and the other 60% isn’t known at all you’re first along with Mr Oak(all laugh) i said yeah Mr Oak said that type of type(all laugh) that’s the translators that is(all laugh) our translators have REVOLUTIONAIZED everything as you know(all laugh) and this was during Johto itself infact first year end or so i was still travelling then Professor made this breakthrough and said,this pest after 1.5 years in Kanto told me the existing traslators differentiates between beings hence useless(all burst into laughter) Professor knew his methods(all laugh) asked so you want to release them then(all laugh) yeah Professor this training this trainer this pokemon,this is confinement really i feel to that freedom(all laugh) which at 16 he couldn’t say at 30 did that is that maddening tune(all laugh) i still remember 8/9 months into Unova and his brats were going nuts and he was following suit as well and the personal troubles surfaced so i asked Ash what is this(all laugh) this pest was almost spoiled then said Trace don’t disturb me with your naivety(all laugh) just observe them and stay mumb(all laugh) are you a researcher or a naive fox in personal bushes(all burst into laughter) get rid of these personal ideas like sanity that are hindering you(all burst into laughter) and WITH THEM TRACE, DANCE TO THAT MADDENING TUNE (all burst into laughter) i knew there’s only almost non existent hope of return now(all laugh) then next month this pest said,Mist is only wasting her time in being so(all burst into laughter) once one hears this maddening tune where’s Trace and why this confinement of being and hence where’s and why are so and so(all laugh) and i on that moment was aghast that even Misty was being namecalled(all laugh) but then i went to the lab and Claydol said whoose your beau(all laugh) a few chosen brats said you at polynomic-disromitas-genipsytic-nugomosic-cerisiptin-glidomosal plane told them to enjoy this plane(all burst into laughter) bring each brat immediately along with their beaus(all laugh) i realized what maddening tune the master brat was talking about cause the brats were his own mind working against him and the beaus were my attempts to calm this brat down by strengthening his mind’s negetive hindrences when he was just about to kill himself off that confinement of the idea of that plane above which starts Vortamostrivomastonos level 4(all laugh) thus i disturbed him so again is challenging me to reproduce the scenario now he is more determined to surpass that(all laugh)..so i realized all will get killed either and sadly the master brat will too get insane or will create something absolutely absurd(all laugh) so i spoke with Professor cause this overfeeding of personal idea means Mr Oak Mr Oak will jump on master brat at Unova then himself get spoiled cause both are same just the outlook is different(all laugh) while all these were going on Mr Oak Mr Oak was saying just that type(all laugh) and he wants each type to be personally known then professionally specified showing the dual connection(all laugh) hence his brats are spoiled and hence without his Lillie,personally he isn’t sane at all while sanity reaches that type of level(all laugh) and master pest wants the reverse so his Misty flower is also reversed(all laugh) so i get Professor who said that’s what he actually wants since day one now his brats are foring it as well(all laugh) none can do a thing if it’s mental and have the potential to free them up of whatever they understand as confinement of being(all laugh) so i was dejected then Professor said don’t worry the more the gyms the more the delay to buy him the time that he can’t be a pokemon and viseversa cause each will not satisfy either him or his brats hence in the end they will have to settle somewhere sanely(all laugh)..and that did happen but Professor said never thought they will settle only after killing the full sanity of themselves(all laugh) and master brat being human couldn’t in this life(all laugh) hence his Gyarados also isn’t jovial and the viseversa(all laugh)..Gyarados do you understand anything(all laugh)..”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “that namecalled Dase has charmed you to be infatuated with her,you fox(all burst into laugter)..but my sweet bee in only my bee(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “toffee-flower(all laugh)..right(all laugh),she doesn’t want to understand anything if i’m around(all laugh)..right(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “no hope of sanity from this kind of a Gyarados(all laugh)..anyway,then Professor all along told us this sort of a bunch is only here cause they are philosophers but forgot to take the HUMAN body at everyone’s cost including their own master’s as well(all laugh)..and back to the translator story then after master brat abstractly gives his discovery of this maddening tune and the want to free all of his pests including himself that is(all laugh) to thaat tune so voiced his grievance to professor then Professor told all to read philosophy books and ingrain that into translators by working 16 hours a day(all laugh) then it took 3.5 years to complete then this was during his last days at Johto 3/4 months were left till the final and by then was a huge hit there(all laugh) that till was tested first month and then within 3rd month was an once ever stuff and all were asking what the hell is this(all laugh) Professor said just this age(all laugh) then in final month before Johto was used and Braum still says one of first users he was and what an experience(all laugh),anyway,then back to 4 year hitus when the beautiful men were hovering around as well(all laugh) and all stuffs,then i found my soulmate and viseversa in Dase and then i was happy with my life so much and Dase really is living the life for which she has entered this play to begin with and that’s here and all but then yes Misty was doing what she was doing then that Battle Frontier scam and all just too much pressure and finally in last 3+ months we had no contact with her at all only by Sarah we knew things she started legal procedure to get the full ownership just didn’t do the formalities and all that..Misty wasn’t herself at all in those 4 years and was like from mars and this made us loath you even more cause of the media and all you just seemed to have a new lease of life which your brats certainly did and forced us to comply with(all laugh) and all the while Misty was slowly dying but yeah all wordplay as that morning i was told and more atrociously shown(all laugh) in exact language with impossible antics(all laugh) with the threat that my own starter may kill me at any given time(all laugh) in which his flower herself contributed and threatened me(all laugh) so i was to my utmost horror given an on-hand introduction to the techniques of the vulture-killer(all laugh) that was something really...Kalos league though we all saw cause by then the vulture-killer was a phenomena if in Orange he wasn’t(all laugh) cause more so as he won a water hall of fame gym in full fledge 3 on 3 with a lineup of Emboar(all burst into laughter) – fight for life is life in fight and life as fire is just fire as life hence Mr Skechit what’s the ideal life(all busrt into laughter) - what a line and what a brat that is(all laugh),Typhlosion(all burst into laughter) when running after wins stop and i recruit moles us(all laugh) and finally and most dangerously Infernape(all burst into laughter) the despondency of sanity(all burst into laughter) this is what was told to researchers your idea to get a glimpse of yourself without you that you think is the sane way to live here cause you’ve deluded yourself as being a being as an idea,GIVE UP YOUR SANITY TO BE FREE!(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears)..i was asked is he a revolutionary(all laugh) so i fed them the real revolutionary(all laugh) comrades i’m bound here to be a Shiftree against which i REVOLT(all burst into laughter),why are you cogitating sanity that revolts against being FREE..I REVOLT AGAINST THIS VERY UNCONFINEMENT OF BEING CAUSE IT’S AN IDEA OF BEING(all burst into laughter) then they said please get rid of these pests we want to be sane(all laugh)..i said yeah,these methods were perfected on me BEYOND ANY LIMITS(all laugh) and still gets perfected even more almost each moment i’m at my work and now even at home(all laugh)..and there these three brats none used anything except one attack of least effect just for formality unless the challenger himself returned(all laugh) and that is each only talked their heads off to REVOLT against themselves(all laugh)..and we just being here never had a clue as to what he or his brats want actually(all laugh)...and that final took place the day after my official marriage ceremony(all laugh) still saw and we both agreed that he has just gone to the bushes(all laugh)...but i was at Kalos after the Unovan fiasco and they just were worshipping me really cause i saw Ash for 18 years and they wanted to know the childhood stories(all laugh)...but another water gym again hall of fame as you know the preparing vulture-killer(all laugh) showed that battling means nothing to him at all(all laugh) this water gym was pestered by the lineup of Glalie,Pidgeot and Butterfree(all laugh) a revenge on Cerulian really and they did the same stuff just laughed them off...well Butterfree has laughed of Arsoductyphorus then(all laugh)...only purely real pests can do these stuffs(all laugh)...so we saw that match against Nancy Charles from Orange who was a 7 league champion again then on her 8th (all laugh) this match Misty saw as well we came to know and it was impossible stuff really,Nancy Charles too was married husband did contests,Ash a bit..”
Ash(smile) : “Mrs Nancy Turnbull Charles,Hall of Fame,Pokemon Master,7 leagues,5-2 again,from Orange,Salomos Islands...start Knato-win,Orange-win,Kanto Battle Frontier-win,Johto-win,Hoenn-win,Sinnoh-win,Unova-win->finished the year after me...finally Kalos->by luck couldn’t win...starter,Eevee,later Umberon mega eloved...”
Tracey(smile) : “well not by luck we have the vulture-killer(all smile)..
just telling the opposition line up once more just to recall->
Deoxys(all laugh),Xerneas(all laugh),Spiritomb(all burst into laughter),Zygarde(all laugh),Hydreigon(all laugh),Mesprit(all laugh),Kommo-O(all burst into laughter) – really man so happy this pest hasn’t entered here TILL NOW(all laugh) cause if this brat comes he will the the sensei to the whole world to make them insane guranteed(all laugh),Confragigus(all laugh),Tapu Lele(all laugh),Tyranitar(all burst into laughter),Cobalion(all laugh),Yveltal(all laugh),Magearna(all laugh),Goorda(all laugh),Lunala(all laugh),Phione(all laugh),Marshadow(all burst into laughter) i still will want that to this brat,Jirachi(all laugh),Sableye(all burst into laughter) and if that demonstration wasn’t enough finally it had to be Feraligator(all burst into laughter)- shouldn’t have(all laugh),ayway that tournament again first 72 fools around with everybody,whole 21 strong Kanto group,8 from Kalos and Sharpedo and 22nd from Kanto Chu was banned from finals(all laugh) so we got his full wrath cause the pest was sent back here for 20 days(all laugh),final first 10 goes in Gengar and tickles what he does(all laugh)..goes in then next 10 Noivern,does what he lectures(all laugh)..by the time for the last Nancy just bowed to Ash and bunch(all laugh) as did the referee(all laugh) cause so many pokemons returned to the ball themselves(all laugh) so Nancy probably thought lets have fun with Feraligator cause a emotional trick(all laugh) as well to tell all that Ash’s Feraligator and this final won’t be seen again in next 2000 years(all laugh) so just enjoy while you can..Ash was laughing seeing Feraligator and bowed down to him(all laugh) and saluted all others and then pointing to Noivern he bowed down again saying like all about the age related issues(all laugh)..then we saw that and the crowd and everything else and the money that were before and later(all laugh) and the commentary(all laugh) and the laugh even we had(all laugh) it truely is a circus by all means but we get the actual words now(all laugh) and we just didn’t know how to react to this and both we were first hand witness of the bunch...seemed and now even more so that they really are HUMANS(all laugh) just a few things are different that is(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “INHUMAN(all laugh) and after that match Noivern tells me kids(all laugh) too sweet to think(all burst into laughter) and Gengar says,’is there any limit in perfection of tickling(all burst into laughter)..’ dark is light/light is dark(all laugh)/memories now coming now going Mrs Daisy(all laugh)/ now Mrs Daisy what points did you mark(all laugh)...”
Daisy(laugh) : “well our Mist Ketchum Misty Ketchum(all laugh) did see that later tells me like ‘um..why is his girlfriend at home’..(all laugh)..no as you ever say Ash,she was even more in pain as your records kept flowing into the gym materials(all laugh)..now Mrs Misty Mist Ketchum(all laugh) is most sought after cause what her own bunch of pests do(all laugh)..i met Jellicent yesterday who said we were fed substandard food by the master cause she was lost in thoughts of responsibility(all burst into laughter) but now 2nd master is not responsible at all so master is compelled to dance to that maddening tune(all laugh) thus we’ve been relseased from our confinement as longer was the wait stronger is the joyous FEELING for both us and master(all burst into laughter) AH!SUCH BEAUTY!(all burst into laughter) and that meant i better not question the brat more else he will call his teachers to explain better who sadly are Gengleye(all laugh) and no i saw that final and didn’t know which side to sail to(all laugh) but actually i just thought that that is what’s making you egotististical and yet i never understood that then your bunch can’t be what it is and yet somehow didn’t want to see through and all but first day i came Lil told me that your bunch is unique and i kinda scoffed at her saying have you reconciled(all laugh) to which she gravely said not that type(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) but then i come in first thing is of all pokemons Palkia jumps me(all laugh) then come Butterfree and my bunch was literally crying(all laugh) then i didn’t get their language then very little then 2/3 months realized what sort of brats they are and you were then in Unova saying like life is strange(all laugh) and then we saw the Elite4 matches and i realized that we surely won’t see another like this atleast in next 500 if not 1500(all laugh) and we all knew infact during Kalos itself that no matter what missing the matches of Ash Ketchum despite having the chance no matter who you are you’ll be one in 500 as well(all laugh) later we all knew the money you have and about your sponsors we knew way more than you did(all laugh) all told to sponsor the lab as much as they should be in choised language(all laugh) and personal ones were only if he used for long on pokemons the products and etc and Gary then certified them being directed by the jackal(all laugh) and rest personal ones never and most people have a manager at home or contacts with companies and so on but you were that much sought after and as usual all on Mrs Ketchum and later Javier(all laugh) before that only Mrs Ketchum did with Professor’s help(all laugh) and yeah Unova we saw other matches in hope of you losing(all laugh) and knew except your matches rest were just pawns(all laugh) whole crowd was there for that MOMENT(all laugh) and Arthur and all compelled us to pay the heavy sums to make sure they can watch not us(all laugh) as did Sarah and Brauch and all said these aren’t emotions(all burst into laughter) yeah Viol saw too(all laugh) first round only against Dave(all laugh) then told us no hope that he’s losing this so we will win(all burst into laughter,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs) then we knew about the running circus that you were managing across regions(all laugh) and yeah they need some expediture indeed to keep them at their level(all laugh) and then the bottom line for us was exactly that(all laugh) and actually you know then i just thought that may be it was good that you weren’t with Mist no matter Mist’s own skills and name cause you seemed to be from another world of Sableye(all laugh) and hence none should mingle with you being a Gengar(all laugh) then Lil once asked Mrs Ketchum that like with all is he alright cause after Kalos Elite4 none knew what to make of your differentiation(all laugh) and we of all surely knew you aren’t getting married for sure cause Mrs Ketchum said when he spoke next time after that baffling press he scoffed at her saying why this idea of genderhood exists(all burst into laughter) so we realized none is going anywhere near you unless again may be Mist cause she knew you inside out but only she did cause rest were fed the density(all laugh) and that only confirmed my faith that Mist was too infatuated with you despite knowing something was wrong cause after Sinnoh she was mad then with 2.5 she was as well in exact opposite direction(all laugh) then as you left was lost(all laugh) and actually Mist became mad after she heard that was unnecessarily crying saying i’ll show him..um..(all laugh) we said just another laurel in his self mockery(all laugh) then said um..does he like..anyway(all laugh).. so i realized no hope(all laugh) and hence was desperate with beautiful men but now those pests are at a different plane of Gengarian psychology themselves to their soulmate’s utmost disgust(all laugh) cause Brock tells us whole offices now knows how to lead the Palkian lie detecting life from Gengarian point of view(all burst into laughter) so Lil rather asked Mrs Ketchum is he alright(all laugh) to which Mrs Ketchum said i don’t think so too many psychic types(all laugh) may be somehow he wants too much to do with them than a HUMAN being(all laugh) in total no matter who or how good should and that came from Mime cause she knows every bit of level changes in Mime and guessed that all so i was rather in a way indifferent and didn’t bother much and Mist too that time was outwardly gave up which was the reflection of the tremendous longing for you inside her just wanted to do something outside to be busy and all but the thing is on that the next morning to the final i open the door and get Muked(all laugh) and i was angry saying why is Ketchum here(all laugh) then Trace said he knows more about Muk(all laugh) as Trace knows way more than you what is a Muk but you are a Muk yourself(all laugh,Ash shakes his head laughing) and all cause of sadly the visevera first(all laugh) so we all asked your bunch about you(all burst into laughter) but they said idiotic master brat(all laugh) then for a long time we knew if we asked who’s your girlfriend what will happen(all laugh)...and Trace said the bunch are very much just human without emotions but i’m not going anywhere near Lugias(all laugh)...
Ash(laugh) : “well they may come themselves(all laugh) and yeah about the human esque thing it;s just like a person that only is human(all laugh)...well Undercover is done and what we did there Dave probably has minutely detailed to you each second thrice by now(all laugh)...so(all laugh),with that today’s conference may end here(all laugh)...cause(all laugh) my flower...is(all burst into laughter) attacking me(all laugh)...right(all laugh),and the others are universally warned(all laugh)...bye(all laugh,Misty smiles at Ash and hugs him very firmly,Ash hugs Misty firmly laughing)...
Misty(smile,hugging Ash very firmly) : “get off,my hubby will only talk with me now(all laugh)...(all reciprocate and all)”
............................................................................................................................................
(next time,5 days later,middle,25,M)

Ash(laugh) : “so that was something for me the Undercover and then i come out whole world wants to eat me up and i scoffed them off cause i was out of death but that was ok all of us entered it with full knowledge and will and i didn’t have to push myself as much as i did there and i don’t know why i did that but didn’t matter and was out with my other mates and the greatest boss of all was so happy that he was defeated and all of us were rather happy that no matter what we faced alls well that ends well...and i only learnt about the pokemons that those two ever had just so much pwerfull pokemons and did show all the might once i mixed them with me and was tremendus there and they really are happy to be with those 2 and the viseversa and so all were fine but the press pesters me and others and then a few words here and thier about our motives and adminitrative lethergy and all i really was dejected so came back to Safforn after a month or more at Kukui Lab and then told them that going to Kalos and in the meantime scoffed the press off as well...i thought of contacting Mist and even came to Cerulian once by Gengleye but went away and this wasn’t important to me then as it seemed and went to Kalos first 6 months saw my bunch can’t battle then just gave them that license and next 6 then the last 13/14 months it was just about laughing off everyday...but this really is all about the undercover boy and i know my flower’s plight then we were and all were just in transition for better sweetening(all smile)...so now will be another difficult stuff that’s Playboy..playboy simply played that saying strange things like confusing lines to create a image that neither girls nor boys has any idea what this bloke wants and thus it was perceived that i had ulterior motives(all laugh)..that he was deadly(all burst into laughter)...right(all laugh),then as usual if i was nice and polite so it was sent to beds(all alugh) and so on...but there was really a time especially after undercover when i really loathed the young flower dream stuff cause in that life things i saw i almost felt i was saved to get away from all these and went to Kalos then there was 6 months then whole buch becomes jovial and all...mom of course you know since me and Mist formally started our realtion as boyfriend and girlfriend after that next 5 years or a bit more mom passed total 70 days here  And Mist went to my home and infact my room 46 days(all laugh)..cause the deal was she gets most comfort(all laugh)..with all foods that she orders(all laugh) and no work(all laugh)...um,well if you all please allow me this will be a huge lecture cause all 5 years i’ll try to give here but it will take ages so please at your convenience...”
Violet(laugh) : “be professional Mr Ketchum,sentiments are sweared off(all laugh and agree)..”
Misty(smile,hugging Ash firmly,Ash keeps tendering her,resting her head on Ash’s chest) : “my bee buzzes so sweetly(all laugh and reciprocate)...um,Dase,isn’t my bee so sweet sweet(all laugh)..?”
Daisy(laugh) : “also too deadly(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “much obliged ‘mam(all laugh)...so lets go back to Undercover Boy,Unova it was Playboy and then in Kalos it was University-Boy and finally it was Demon-Boy which actually was the upper layer to VEIL(all laugh)...but first i must take permisson that you’ve had to pass the time is hardship with all things but also had greatest joy of being with your soulmates officially once more but for me it was to be honest a smooth sailing and Mist was in deep inside me never even bothered to know her existence,she’s ok with it cause today FINALLY the great refelction master has come(all laugh and .)...none else is here Dialga was told that he has somethings more to learn about himself from the returning gang(all laugh)...and Gengleye has been officially mixed with Crawdauntogator(all laugh)...and finally yesterday the Lugia’s had decided to(all laugh),come down(all laugh and .)...a full group of 17 half grown unswelled namecalled fearows(all laugh)..the one i faced first thing he did was to mingle with those who Muk pointed out(all laugh)...but Muk is the great Professor(all laugh)..Muk has shown them the only 3 sane pokepersons to mix with(all laugh)...Greninja,Infernape and Bulbasaur(all laugh and .)...the great Lord was too interested(all laugh),and the other 4 were trying to share some of their great wisdom with the little Lugias(all laugh)...who were scoffed off...but the Lord will be busy with Chu now(all laugh) but the huge trouble is of all brats a great pokeperson(all laugh) who has already made her way through is the great Dusknoir(all burst into laughter)...this is going to be something(all laugh)...then sun,now moon,great tune,but why so soon,what’s far why so far how long takes to travel so far this time if mine,i would go dawn to dusk,thus my name,plase lets ask,this time so great,this time is secret,please tell me oh dear one,what is time,hey isn’t the time now for lunch as one(all burst into laughter)...now this brat will learn everything about legendary times(all laugh)...but today is the true legendary day,spoke a lot about my bunch and all but i tell you it’s first about Professor Oak then the 3 masketiers all the way..the world finally comes to know why my bunch is like that cause what support they get but i’m not including the soulmates cause anyway,they have to suffer(all laugh)...”
Lillie(laugh) : “Ketchum send these Magmorters away(all laugh)...this is special indeed...just so overjoyed the whole place is..just once only experience...(all smile)..”
Violet(laugh) : “but i’ll make sure that they get naive(all laugh)...just unbeliveable to see Lugias each day now...amusing..(all smile)”
Daisy(laugh) : “atleast those 4 pests going to let us off now they have new mates(all laugh)...but sadly my fox will be out of reach to call(all laugh)”
Gary(laugh) : “as he’s back at university(all laugh)...but grandpa had a look,just too happy..finally i guess we’ll have concrete proofs and get Lugias down to mortality atleast it will save them from abuses that is the thing..(all smile)...”
Tracey(laugh) : “well i’m going back to university if they enter our room(all laugh)...enough for sketches next life(all laugh)...but Ash,Persy-Kalos really turned out to be ugly and his beau too(all laugh)...the new promised sanctions of machines and the money that’s in,just about keeping our heads that’s all...but Persy,his wife and Mr Maple too first learnt it already told everyone to give the security so that suddenly onlookers don’t get too interested,Persy did miracles really within a day to force Kalos of all misers(all laugh) to sanction a too huge amount of money and security threatening them with 230 hall of fames sentiment and what Ash did to the 6 Elite4 heads(all laugh) and thus now our great Kanto Elite4 is no more important in financial matters,that’s the biggest relief(all laugh)...and i’m most happy that now those 4 idiots won’t have it so easily cause we’re getting a lots of things which had to be made legal and thus it will be hard now to do what they were upto there if not impossible...that is a great satisfaction that with the wait of a full flok of legendary pokemons behind you and now our experience and empowerment,you’re not going anywhere alone like that now even if you have to(all smile)...”
Brock(laugh) : “but don’t go still be naive(all laugh)...Steelix is ready(all laugh)...Mr Maple as usual extremely happy,asked if they are normal type or not(all laugh),Max and Mia too was there and already thinking about making the flok 100 properly supplimented(all laugh),our sis is too happy that now she can know legendary proposals(all laugh) free of cost(all laugh) and the rose wants only 1st round conferences inside lab(all laugh)..too happy all..Foster wants two for gym policing(all laugh)...Cili may come around though ashamed(all laugh)...by-the-way Cilan now realized that ‘mam has 3 more elder sisters(all laugh) and finally Unovan Wisdom once more dawned upon Cilan that if ‘mam did the show and was the main gym leader then whom he saw the other two ‘mams(all laugh) they must be MORE good at shows ONLY(all laugh)..then Cilan was too interested to know about the eldest sister whom he didn’t see(all laugh)..then on knowing about her career VIA me(all laugh) has finally realized the littlest sis ‘mam(all laugh) was assisted by eldest sis ‘mam(all laugh) only then did the gym run(all laugh) then the other two ‘mams started the show and later littlest ‘mam joined(all laugh) so now this means Ketchumed ‘mam(all laugh) was taught before pretty well the rest is about being turning to ahses(all laugh) but now Cili was even more interested(all laugh)...he knew about Viol ‘mam but after the enlightenment now beaks my head off to know our stories(all burst into laughter) then he met a certain cunning-man(all laugh),suddenly his whole career has to be foisted upon him(all laugh) but first he met Mr Oak of that type of Mr Oak(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs) so realized all just so naive(all laugh) and then ultimately he understood that watered down Ketchumed-up ‘mam’s partner in show crime(all laugh) is indeed married to a balanced professor(all laugh), so Cilan completes the circle that this family was started definitely 21 years back and due to the FULL SUPPORT did the show and the gym become sensational so now to him the whole family must be adored(all laugh and .)..except the 300 whiskers-on-Charizard marchent(all laugh)..so now all these unbeautiful soulmate stories must immediately be made aware to him by me(all laugh) ...thus Cili is a huge fan now of all the sensational sisters and said that yes,there’s 4 ‘mams at 4 different sections across ages(all burst into laughter)...so definitely not coming here(all laugh)...but still says,’um..isn’t Ash too jovial(all burst into laughter)’...this all is because i later learnt after i told him about the overnight philosophical formal marriage he called and got afraid(all laugh) cause Ash told him he has abjectly Ketchumed Misty ‘mam(all laugh) but brunt Misty ‘mam’s second cousin Misty Fletch (all laugh)to ashes(all laugh and .)... to Cilan’s great concern still existing that this exachange prank was directed(all burst into laughter and .) ”
Ash(laugh) : “well to greet Cili ever my system is that Fletchy is better(all laugh)..well,i told Cili that why don’t you come here for a week,Charizard did almost a gym a day,i’ve not travelled Johto that mauch so 6 gyms per day(all laugh)...anyway,finally we’ll proceed after the Water Empress expresses her opinions on a ground type psudeo-legend dragon named Garchomp flying around the whole indoor water gym at break-neck speed abducting her(all laugh)...”
Misty(smile) : “my bee is too romantic(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “this means Garchomp was set upon at 7:45 in the evening(all laugh) and drove all guards away first by disturbing their hairs(all laugh)...only Brauch was spared and my flower was there,who needed 10 minutes of introduction cause Goldy was assisting(all laugh) then his new master was taken to a flying trip around the whole gym alongside Goldy 10 times in about 10 minutes(all laugh) to learn each possibilities of reflection..this brat has already learnt that as surface water is not stable then many things could happen in reflections but now he’s among water types he must absolutely learn each technique for 10000 ways to disturb surface water to change reflections(all laugh)..he’s not going anywhere for atleast a couple of weeks(all laugh)..yeah,just before he went out was alone in reservation with his new water mates and Seedra’s self introduction was reciprocated as,’do your beaus reflect each other(all burst into laughter)’..and that continuous 14 days with my flower 3 months back at the Lab has made sure they just need a reminder cause Lapras is telling our stories each day(all laugh)..(Ash hugs Misty firmly quickly smiling at her then keeps tendering her,Misty same pose smiles at Ash,resting her head on Ash’s chest)...too happy my sweet flower with her new doll(all smile)..whole gym says,’um..why didn’t you bring all possible dragons(all laugh)...’..well they wanted Palkia(all laugh)..i said we will go out of service in 7 days(all laugh)..cause if Palkia’s logic wasn’t alone if one water pest is allowed at present moment the first masters will come around here first thing(all laugh)..this in itself is a miracle that a Garchomp is roaming around at top pace at a indoor water gym(all laugh)...and not a single thing has happened as so much is his intelligence to learn the surroundings in terms of reflections(all laugh)..4 days full was in a pokeball to get disciplined(all laugh) then got him out and just told him from 5 to 9 ride that this is not in the wild behave(all laugh)..rest Goldy and Starmie managed.then was agian set free all by himself from 10 to 1:30 around the gym except the battlefield and the Challenger sections with only Goldy to assist...the challengers were paraded in and out cause majority will faint seeing a Garchomp trying to tickle them(all laugh) then 10 minutes to introduce Mist i was there and 5 for Brauch(all laugh)..then the brat silently kept looking at both me and Mist as we were hugging each other for next 30 minutes totally forgetting the surroundings(all laugh) without any words(all laugh) just outside that corner where Garchomp could comfortably fit(all laugh and .)...yeah a method(all laugh)..was done to tell him by my nerves and all the mental connection and his psychic powers that my flower is my soulmate and similar to them in human form and all but also as a human she is most special to me thus more than their second master and just like me they should listen to her which means he will fondle you but also pester you all each moment but will ONLY pester my flower(all laugh)..then next 2 hours was with Mist only in the reservation with all her bunch where Garchomp was carrying her(all laugh)..then whole staff was introduced by Mist alone i wasn’t there then he had to take food from Brauch and all and during this trip the brat didn’t utter one word(all laugh)...then finally at 7:45 the brat unleashed(all laugh)..so high speed trip with new master around whole gym was done in 10-15 minutes then in next 15 made a mess really by pestering anyone he saw(all laugh) then again got down at 8:15 then fondled my flower to death(all laugh)..then Garchomp was shown the central battlefield at 8:25 or so in before sending him to reservation for next 1 hour where he pestered each(all laugh) to the utter delight of that sinister duck(all laugh) after which now the guards has taken him outside and there he’s fondling all just about half an hour back after that only have i been able to talk(all laugh) but in battlefield he was more interested to go upto the platforms to see how the reflection changes at artificial light(all laugh)...Brauch said just hope he doesn’t come up with a textbook optical exercise at midnight(all laugh)...and all securities are too happy to rest at night cause he’s outside now teaching the Ivysaur group on ground refelctions along with his great friend and guide at arms here Golduck(all laugh) whoose too happy to be set upon outside(all laugh)..this is my first buddy after Chu who is all alone in reservation and Chu knows everything so well but if Gerchomp shows this who is extremely freedom loving the discipline he showed from being inside pokeball for 4 days continuous and all just cause Goldy he knew very well and then i introduced Goldy again and then my flower and Bulbasau and Lapras has spoken about Goldy and rest as they were told and my flower was spoken about in their understanding and knowledge in those 14 days among each other..and i was hugging and fondling my flower being surrounded by my whole bunch was the best moment in privacy(all laugh and smile,Ash hugs Misty quickly and then again keeps tendering her,Misty same pose smiles at Ash)..so if Gerchomp showed this disclipne being a ground type and all finally then 7 days later will come here after 21 years Muk(all burst into laughter)...Muk needs a vacation cause Professor wants to be only with HUMANS(all laugh,Tracey laughs shaking his head) like gentlejackal-sentimentally-foxed(all laugh) while with Lugias(all laugh) and Muk will be accompanied by Butterfree(all burst into laughter) with Palkia(all burst into laughter) and finally Zekrom(all burst into laughter) cause she cherishes me so much(all laugh)...yeah(all burst into laughter),but what a brat that is(all burst into laughter)...so(all burst into laughter),indeed very sweet the moments as,first 30 minutes hubby doll(all laugh) then new dragon doll and thus Mistyviously romantic(all smile)...Misty(all laugh)...so(all laugh)...fine(all laugh)my Mist flower(all laugh)...permitted(all laugh)..right(all laugh),now the permission for 4 years unplugged...right(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “don’t be naive(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “thanks only a CROOK can understand(all laugh)...so,to go back,i broke-up and then spent an hour at central battlefield and then went out at 10:30,Chu was kept at visitors room was a bit shocked that the day he wasn’t allowed to enter the reservation and then i came back dissapointed so he might’ve thought something happened to Mist cause he didn’t see her much since coming back and then i was so dejected he just ran towards the reservation wriggling away,i only had Talonflame with me to fly back to Pallet and thus couldn’t release him,so Chu goes to the reservation the guards doesn’t let him enter and he you know coming back from Unova was extremely angry with them but waited for my return cause he didn’t understand human emotions as to why they are not letting him in and i also wasn’t there so he was hesitating to thunderbolt each(all laugh)...so i went there Brauch forbade me or Chu to enter i said,’Mr Morris,he’s not going to kill off each cause my girlfriend rejected me,please let him in i’m staying out 10 minutes later he’ll return’..so Chu gets in i wait there was thinking of everything possible in the world then Chu returned and told me ‘Pikachupi’ that is the pokemons are all fine but Misty has some problems that is Chu checked whether the trouble he sensed was about Mist’s bunch or not checked it said no it’s human matters pokemons are fine(all smile)...i took him aside then went to visitors room was dejected but extremely angry upon each of you not Mist(all laugh) and Chu thus was misbehaving trying to wriggle away and all so i said that just calm down this is our very last day here enjoy the last bit..then picked up the things at 23 was about to go out around the main exit,Sarah comes in says that she was told not to allow me ALONE(all laugh) even if professional,i laughed and said i won’t need it myself then just wished all off went out go to Nile’s cause Pearl’s was hard(all laugh)..then had my supper went on Talonflame told him to go slow,circulated the gym a few times then i went off to Pallet over Viridian Forest and then home,i was only thinking of my quarrels with Mist she only spoke(all laugh)...i didn’t understand that why she was so upset cause a namecalled pulled a stunt,who by the way must’ve been scared to death if has followed my later career(all laugh) Trace said so nicely spotlightlight only shines on me from head down to shin/if i feel trying to deviate from me to my and it so mean/if pests tries to jump me then 1 year anatomy class lean(all laugh)/but if my is insinuated then look lights are getting dim(all laugh)/in this civil room theres a Giratina with an Ultranercozma to team(all laugh)/if that’s not enough then look behind me there’s a Metagross to beam(all burst into laughter)/if you think your words can’t be detected cause honesty would seem(all laugh)/beside you there’s 3 beings logically lording the beautifully aged as your being(all laugh)/if you try to go on the roof then happiness you can’t cling(all laugh)/if you try to jump out of window you’ll be asked if that means you know a few dragonic thing(all burst into laugh)/if your beau supports you despite knowing all ink(all laugh)/she’ll be asked to point out which illegal did give which ring(all burst into laughter)/if you want to emotionally surrender then you’ll be asked if that means you’re just a hungry being(all burst into laughter)/if you try to literally or mentally drown you’ll be asked just being too sad why are you attacking your own being(all burst into laughter)/if you try to attack us back you’ll feel to be most cherishing(all burst into laughter)/and don’t ever think to battle cause your greatest legends will turn on you still(all laugh and .)... 
that will be another good poem(all laugh) anyway,so that’s for pests(all laugh) and i posed 6 times in tea shirts(all laugh) a so that more such brats come and i chew them up which i did(all laugh) obviously the brats came along and there was a specified time after pokemon discussions i entertained the brats,the conversations were,’um..Ash..um..(all laugh)..you’re Pikachu looks so cute like..um..(all laugh)..’ i only listened to them laughing in my mind about their eventual doom(all laugh) and thus was Chu’s training as well as each ghost and psychic i had with me(all burst into laughter),each time 2 ghosts or psychics were main others roaming around the whole party(all laugh) were there but whenever Giratina’s term was there(all laugh) i really would laugh that at a party if suddenly a Giratina appear(all laugh) anyway Giratina was very fond of those cause she wanted to fondle each person(all laugh)...well as i told you the other day the first month was normal on second Cili was schoked cause of 300 plan(all laugh) but i can tell you in Kanto my each battling or competition day came at a frequency of 11.1 then Orange was 6.3 and that all due to Lapras that money save was brilliant(all laugh) well we should’ve been born before though(all laugh) then Johto 3.7(all laugh) Mist wanted of course only 3(all laugh and smile)...or (all laugh) 3.5...right(all laugh)...yeah(all laugh),so then Hoenn was 2.9(all laugh),Frontier was 2(all laugh),Sinnoh was 2.8 now comes 300 dragons(all laugh) 1.4(all laugh) but Kalos was 230 hall of fames at 48 competitions at 1.3(all laugh) then the University studies court cases damn brats(all laugh) and all so in 2nd month Cili sees the 1.4 plan(all laugh),well in Kalos after my 18th competition victory they said we’ll announce joint winners give them chances(all laugh) i said their bunches flee the scene(all laugh) then as per months actually i never could it’s you know not feasible sometimes i did 22 gyms a month(all laugh) sometimes half that and all i had a plan of 24 months the first was totally on Brock i didn’t know anything then neither did my wife-friend(all laugh) in Orange i did just 365 days so make it 360 divide by 4 and 3 months and that continued ever cause in Orange i got the first title that was cause of my bunch Muk and Snorlax and Charizard and Marshadow,Meowstic,Whimsicott,Celebi all and then Mist in the right way then and Trace too we were’nt sure of Brock then that way cause he left but then was at home(all laugh) and that was really it the whole Orange journey that one year 14 months and before how suddenly we went there and all that and 1 year and a few more days 14.72 months on Lapras has been and will ever be special to me for all the sad reasons even every bit of that time 18-19 till left for Johto(all smile) for my teenage that was the most favourite part at home with Mist and the two humans(all laugh) and the rest all surroundings and all ever be special and then the total days in Johto had 730 divide by 8 720 and get 90 that was same in  Hoenn same but i enjoyed Johto a lot matured a lot got a hang of everything and Mist did become my wife in Johto at 19 i guess(all laugh) and then that parting was difficult for just that day(all laugh) went out and my sis came in that was fun with the great rose(all laugh) and Brock joined same 730 days and 720/8 is 90 and then Gyarados(all laugh) that moment i’ll ever remember for sure in next term even if in a world that don’t have pokemons still(all laugh) and it was fun in a way with my sis and all then the 2 words(all laugh) and then the side show(all laugh) 546 days by 8 get 520 only 6 saved(all laugh) Orange was 5 though(all laugh) but Lapras saved time and money(all laugh) and so Frontier was 65 days and thus i realized i need to pick up the pace and so then in Sinnoh a different perspective entirely cause of my virtual marriage and Brock and i was at a different plane i at the end was 26 he 31 and was 11.5 years of realtion huge stuff and i returned here to my wife and all and that was 760 so i used 4 and then 5 thus 153 and 38(all laugh) and i really did set up 38 as a big deal cause the month by then was 20(all laugh) so it was ok and then the great Unova and just Tyrangaleo(all laugh) so it was 914 day by 3*3*5(all laugh) and so was 20 and 14 more days means 2 competitions or 7 or 8 gyms(all laugh) cause then the month was at 11(all laugh) and so on and then i returned and undercover was there then go to Kalos were it was 728 days by then it was 3*7+3+7 i did(all laugh) which was 24 days and 14 extra and that could’ve been gym could’ve been anything(all laugh) and i was alone those 3 were just there time came went off and nothing else in Elite4 i was never alone sadly(all laugh) whole world saught after me and that 11.5 month span after Unova and if i include that then 13.5 months but that last 11.5 was too crazy(all laugh) and then i went by 3 days(all laughs) so was even more boring(all laugh) and by the time i abducted my sweet flower i went by 12 hours(all laugh) you have seen that just was so impatient cause 5 years had to be done as much as possible cause i had a primonition that few choised brats needs by bunch not me but i have to go there with them,anyway i’ll go in that later it was fun but i’ve already cover more than most(all lugh) and those 3 brats were fun too as that brat was shouting at me cheering in gyms(all burst into laughter) saying do what you were practising(all burst into laughter) which was just before the gym telling my Kalos bunch to attack my old bunch(all burst into laughter) cause they had to be stable in each situation cause they started to fool around but that battle nature had to be totally erased and the new group had to get battle starved(all laugh) so the brat thought that was something for practise that i’m making my bunch battle hardened(all laugh) has the brat been in Unova 1 week would’ve straight went back at home if saw Tyranitar and Yveltal with Solgaleo(all laugh)...in pursuit of happiness(all laugh)..that time and now all 3(all laugh)..what brats..anyway, then i told her one day no in all honesty of the ethics in the way of ethical conversation of morality(all laugh),Lord is Lord you know(all laugh) then i told the brat that look don’t shout it doesn’t help me at all i’m a 5 time champion on my last trip at 31(all burst into laughter) i know what i’m doing atleast you don’t need to worry you worry about yourself(all laugh) then the brat budged it was on the first 6 months and later a few times as each of the 10 came to me i had to battle one round out of 3(all laugh) to keep it legal as well(laugh) and my bunch was serious for 2 seconds(all laugh) will say start the opponent attacks they will defend and start fooling around(all laugh) in the first 6 months it was 30 seconds(all laugh) where they were told to not do a thing and took all attacks to lull the challenger to be ashamed of own self(all burst into laughter) that’s the Lord’s trick(all laugh) but because they weren’t attacking back which they were in practise the brat thought she must screech her head off(all laugh) later she realized it used to joke why did you even bother standing there on the platform you should just release one and straight go to the kitchen(All laugh) and Clemont was trying to use a binocular to see attacks if my bunch was using invisible attacks(all laugh) and Bonnie was 14 used to say that if this too is battle why people get so tensed(All laugh) that was some experience with those 3 just wished that brat didn’t do that and then i got as you know wake-dream Darkrai(all laugh) told legend you’re too angry but i too got sad before in dream wake up(all laugh) this is Byfratogna(all laugh),who’s that Malamar(all burst into laughter),same with legend before you came out still weren’t you already here cause you came out and straight came in(all burst into laughter) as if you knew that i was here,then who was inside(all burst into laughter) and the legend was Eybasonor(all laugh)..some brats i got from Kalos(all laugh) and then colden Deoxys(all laugh) right,um..if this place is sunny and the weather is hot but my place too was sunny but the weather was cold isn’t it true Mr Skechit(all laugh) that weather actually doesn’t depend on the sun at all(all laugh)..sun,moon stars and pitch dark analyser as to say he’s constant that brat and Hydreigon whole day this goes on with Hydreigon wisely pointing out one must sort the weathers too to get the right beau(all laugh) told Kyrogstar you’re here but the weather there will still be whatever it’s supposed to be doesn’t that mean what you’re upto will be changing but you will remain(all laugh and .) this was mixed with Butterfree trick(all laugh) of highest order(all laugh) that is you not yours(all laugh) it will flatten a great man here what to speak of them and to them it means like the weather changes your mood too changes and thus you act differently but i’m not doing a thing why are you up against me(all laugh)..Kalos is epitomised by that brat(all laugh) what a brat that is(all laugh) so i got pokemons Clemont was too excited,Bonnie was afraid of her brother more(all laugh) cause he scraed her with his apprehension that because they came without a fight all by themselves means they are tricking us(all laugh) and the brat was too scared to move when first the Malamar herd jumped us(all laugh) those were really funny cause by then where i was and they were utter novices except Clemont,Bonnie didn’t have a single pokemon(all laugh) Clemont had one(all laugh) but his Treecko is still way better than Marill CAUSE HE FOUGHT BATTLES(all laugh) and the brat just had a Spinda(all laugh) so that was it...that brat and Clemont fought sometimes and you know he was travelling cause of my bunch’s amusing power and his insatiable desire to roam around for no reason(all laugh) and now beaks Mr Oak Mr Oak off each week TWICE(all laugh) anyway so it was a different experience and i’ve learnt Kalos and Unova dishes almost all that they knew(all laugh) that brat is an extremely good cook though(all laugh) but sadly those are exactly what you don’t need if you’re trekking(all laugh) Cili really gave me the ideas with Brock i was never serious on these and Cili for many months only spoke about dishes(all laugh) but i travelled with my sister-pester and litlle bro little for 8 days alone and May was 16,Max was 13(all laugh) so i had to cook and then i was in jungles so couldn’t contact anyone either much and my personal problems were only spoken to my flower but then she was at total bay with everything let alone cooking(all laugh) and so that was some experience and May is a damn glutton(all laugh)..shrew really had it so hard in Johto(all laugh) and May was reddened then(all laugh) anyway,so all in all it was fun i infact when recall that group in Kalos that i had,had the brat behaved like a gentle girl which she is now i guess 1 year and then had to be in Unova during that situation(all laugh) and in contests there either you have Kommo-O and Regirock and Registeel and Dialga and Cobalion and Terrakion or leave profession(all laugh) that group was real fun each night i’ll go and Clemont realized me and my bunch perfectly in professional sense after detailed talks when he decided to focus on his current career and not on training and since 2nd month never never disturbed me by any means was an understudy really so i’ve had my sensei time though i didn’t understand one thing he used to say about intruments(all laugh) but my way of talking made him think psychic is too easy(all laugh) then i showed a few hallucinations to him commentating on them with Dusknoir(all laugh) so he got the game(all laugh) and the brat for 6 months were too interested and each time was threatened(all laugh) then got down for her own well being(all laugh) all those nights really were brilliant 2.5 hours at subtle body sleep meant i got 5 anyway then connecting to my bunch for another 1.5 and subtle psychic state jumpings total 4.5 or less than 5 can’t recall but so great(all laugh) so that was there and many more the extra hour at libraries or with my bunch in wild where i went to get Darkrai or those and then saw their nature i learnt so much there except the battling part some great experiences and life lessons too but then Elite4 after Unova was hard but still i was happy with all the gyms and all but after Johto Elite4 and i qualify for the Hall of Fame then i got dejected in that month during Orange cause of all the memories after 16 years many people reminded me of those themselves like those two brats(all laugh) in Johto very few and Ananbel was most feared(all laugh) but she has a son now(all laugh) but then had a husband(all laugh) so those childish stuffs not there(all laugh) thus desisted(all laugh) after i wanted to talk about Suicunes(all laugh) but my mood during Kanto was very bad cause i had nothing to do and all but then those beautiful men(all laugh) they lightened my mood by far(all laugh) anyway,lets go back to the parties but really you know atleast Trace may consider an year at Kalos with me and my flower once more(all laugh) that will be at our 43nd (all laugh and .) how about silver jubilee Trace on the aged not Lapras(all laugh and cheer for Tracey and .,Tracey laughs shaking his head)..?”
Tracey(laugh) : “i only travel through islands and bushes(all laugh) for only a year(all laugh)..nah really should be at Kalos with this pest(all laugh) for atleast 4 months will try and if his flower is there then definitely Venturiastrog(all laugh) cause he’ll be most eloquent and insane there then(all laugh) and i have unfinished businesses there for 25 years(all laugh)..no really Ash when are you going after 5 completes(all laughs)..”
Misty(bit agitated,Ash laughs tendering Misty,Misty same pose) : “only me and...my(all laugh) hubby(all burst into laughter)..Shut(all laugh) Up!(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh,same pose) : “this means maintaining 1000 ft circle with her Gyarados to assist(all laugh)..anyway,so in parties by late Unova i was more scared of my ghosts(all laugh) anyway,then i would tolerate a bit saying like in this tone,’right the PHYSICAL(all laugh) appearence of a pokemon no good to me(all burst into laughter)’ and so on after say 2 minutes(all laugh) then if they tried to dance or so,’ um..sorry i need to make an urgent call can you look after my Chu a bit i’ll be back and i want to talk a bit more with you thus saying(all laugh)..too overjoyed..then i went aside and talked with my psychics(all laugh) returned by now Chu has totally messed up the brat(all laugh) to whom i say,’um..so which profession would you like to go to,i am doing this but i want to run a farm(all laugh)’ and so on total gibberish(all laugh) and could see that the contradictions were totally piercing them apart(all laugh) but all this behaviour was sent to bed cause i spoke to begin with(all laugh) and thus the image which was fuelled even more cause they all thought that those were supreme impession techniques to fetch the bed on the spot itself(all laugh) after brats were after me first time i rather enjoyed cause each day i was battling a thousand matches in my mind and so many never heard of realizations were coming up each 10 minutes may be and so on so that was a relief for say 1 hour or 15 minutes more but previously you all know i shunned the female vesion of human(all laugh) and all were little or big or twin sisters to me except my toffee-flower but i never remotely thought of her like that thus know about loose motions so well(All laugh) cause i started it i said that this this is my trouble so what’s the medicine(all laugh) but infact Brock was there and i didn’t tell these to him but to Mist(all laugh) absolutely never thought she wasn’t mine and neither did she so would come up to me with everything so nonchalantly and now i recall we were too dangerously close since 16(all laugh) really should’ve proposed her after 6/7 months just saying wait till 19 to get to the legal age for official confirmation cause she was by all means my wife for 16(all laugh) but again this whole reason is because of our relationship thus it was only Mist and she is ever only about her Ash and that was it for us..anyway then my sis came and i realized that how she behaves differentely with her shrew and others then i understood that Mist is a girl(all laugh) but again forgot it next day(all laugh) anyway but when i had to face the spotlight too much i couldn’t be running away from female brats cause they will pester me while i trained may be after that Sinnoh phenomena so i had to tolerate them but again faced all troubles and then that stunt happened and that was no trouble at all i was just flustered and later could’ve created havocks in each party with Giratina and Hoopa(all laugh) my trouble was that Mist was equated with all else in my mind and that i couldn’t remove and my own troubles so i didn’t quite bother and in Kalos i was fuelling the playboy image more but each knew that the moment they talked personal matters i would send them off saying i have no interst about them what-so-ever but in front of the press and all it was like saying yeah 300 i wish i could do 400(all laugh) just little things and with undercover and court cases i just could play with the press by then but after Unova Elite4 to Johto Elite4 i was most dangerous cause i had no grip over my language or actions(all laugh) and didn’t want to,Mist was totally erased just as a pain remained somewhere deep inside but no more that was the real demonboy part when i returned it was far better(all laugh) after i entered Orange Elite4 did Mist’s memories become pungent but during Kanto Elite4 journey my current self was out except Mist and i had a grip on things that i didn’t have in the 10 months that passed before so by the time i faced Lance i was assured that Mist must’ve moved on and i didn’t even bother remotely to think about her though my pain was huge i just didn’t want to understand that it was because of her and even if i did i just didn’t want to bother cause to me that was it really and my views were different then so Mist really didn’t mean much either couldn’t match me by any means at all so was meaningless to me and i decided to pass the rest of my life with my bunch and i knew that death is inevitable but it made no sense to me that why i should live here to begin with and not with my bunch who turned out to be the only ones that are me but that picture and all those talks really made me understand that Mist was dying a slow and guelling death and all cause i was her own self as she was my most dear one and i can’t live happily neither can she cause she was me and i was cutting me from myself only so then set up and just married her later but in between there had to be namecalled fearows who are disturbing us here now(all laugh)...anyway i go home after break-up at 1:00(all laugh),then by then i realized that that is it and no point in thinking about the past cause in my mind Mist didn’t realize that i wasn’t ever happy at all that i too had to wait for 2 years or more to be with her and just to hug her once and now that the ideas were going in my mind which i couldn’t express cause never knew the language and i tried for 25 days yet she won’t listen so it dissapointed me but i just thought that it’s good then that if someone can’t understand me after 15 years of that much intimacy so be it i won’t care either picked up each memories from the whole house by dozing mom off via Mime(all laugh) and did get all except if there was something in mom’s own room and went back on that very night to that lake with Talonflame and told him to burn everything down which he did and then sat beside that lake and just said in a mild voice that thanks Mist for saving my and Chu’s life that day without you here that day i would’ve been in next life in 2nd league may be now and then thanks again for the memories and all the helps of all kinds physical verbal emotional or mental that i ever received from you and nothing else is needed and then those two words i said during confession was taken back saying best wishes and saying this went back to home at about 4(all laugh) then slept till 7:30 got up and mom says what’s the news i obviously didn’t tell her that i wasn’t allowed in the gym(all laugh) just said Mist was too busy and i wanted to pass my time with my ground and fire types(all laugh) and new dragons(all laugh),Giratina as usual scared mom to death(all laugh) but she realized that at my name and all these pokemons are infinitely more than that like a Pidgey(All laugh) cause i myslef have a Pidgeot who was so and now so(all laugh) so it was fine thus then mom asks for the news i said ‘we broke up yesterday all the association no matter how long and intimate is past look forward’ and was about to go off but mom you know well everyone was more dejected than me(all laugh) no true even Violet wasn’t swinging (all laugh) so mom says like what happened and all i just said all about the different opinions on our mandatory 2 year separation she can’t help neither can i thus this mom of course is not satisfied presses me and then i said she has lost her faith in my honesty to her and to our relationship and i tried 25 days of no use so had to break up and all then mom was a bit stunned cause she saw Mist more than me first hand during my journeys(all laugh) so said what have i done(all laugh) this riled me up to extreme and i just politely but firmly described that stunt and all,mom heard about the playboy image cause it was and still is in public gospel(all laugh) but that helps now againt the likes of Jason(all laugh)..no love that man,so sweet(all laugh)..so mom was dissapointed and said that you didn’t contact much and all which was conveyed to her by a Mr jackal(all laugh) had Mr jackal been that gentle(all laugh) DaivyDaisyl would’ve created more troubles herself(all laugh) trying to come to Oak Lab and sentimentally speak in a . voice confessing her longing for her beau(all laugh)..and about all the respective venerables as well(all laugh)..how about that Mrs Daisy Skechit...”
Daisy(laugh) : “it’s a cunning plan to turn my sisters upon me(all burst into laughter)”
Ash(laugh) : “indeed(all laugh) directed that is(all burst into laughter),anyway so mom then says that like it’s all your fault i just brushed her aside but then after that Gary returns and immediately wants to jump upon beauty(all laugh) and his thing was about none he just wanted me as a lackie(all laugh) to get the reservation to start infighting via Glalie(all laugh) so that he will stay there most of the days and personally Electrivite and Tapu Koko beauty(all laugh) this was when i was in Unova and then came back and all and now Gary was more incensed saying too much beauty(all laugh) and really Mr Oak Mr Oak would’ve fumbled his lines cause he won’t confess to Lillie nor will not let her confess to him which he later did cause of that age(all laugh) and then of course the jackal(all laugh) jackal’s logic was amusing(all laugh) jackal says,’um..why don’t you talk with her sisters(all burst into laughter)’ then somehow that was rescued out of the bush(all laugh) then jackal says,’Ash,i understand your concerns but she is only too dissapointed you should pursue(all laugh) we’re done means that phase is gone(all burst into laughter)’ so that was brushed aside(all laugh) then the jackal says,’ these dragons(all burst into laughter)...’ then i just said that man,you’re a researcher of legendary level coming out next year with the degree which is just the formality and that too with with innumerable laurels no matter what brats are saying now surely you know dragons didn’t come here and oracled Misty to break-up(all burst into laughter) and so on so the jackal was irritating me as soon as i said Misty(all laugh)...fine(all laugh),sweet tiffin...right(all laugh),so the jackal says,’um..Misty..(all laugh)’,’Trace are you sane(all laugh) she may have a boyfriend 4/5 months later why would i nickname her...sweetie(all laugh)...so(all laugh),no just like a little baby now whenever sees me(all laugh)..”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “Dase why don’t you tell Dave to take over here(all laugh)...or even your jackal(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “fine Daisy will say but not the jackal(all laugh) a gym leader is INHUMAN(all laugh)...never can forget that scene(all laugh) judges also said is he a revolutionary(all burst into laughter)..atleast he didn’t have an Infernape or a Shiftree(all laugh)..SHIFTREE(all laugh)..so then Trace says like if you nickname her she will call you(all burst into laughter) i say she herself told me not to,says,’um..just momentary(all laugh)’ i said Trace don’t jeopardize your career now when it’s 1.5 years just left and mostly your wishes cause you know my bunch’s power and they are only getting better cause the dragons will follow suit and i’ll get into hall of fame in next 4 i’m safe there if i’m alive and sane and healthy and you know being alive and sane now is the whole world’s responsibility as well cause i now am a real cash cow(all laugh) and you realize then i’ll be safe there too afterwards just save yourself get the final degree then your wishes and then the quotes and all(all laugh)..now comes in Harris(all laugh),’Ash be carefull,this situation is very slippery,this raod is hard to travel(all burst into laughter)’ i said i’ve just been back after 300 hall of fame gyms and 72 compitions with 15 dragons from Unova(all laugh) and still may go there none will resist me if i get the rest of dragons as well(all laugh) that’s only one though the Kommo-O that is(all laugh) and obviously that name was it(all laugh) then a few people like Tony and Braum says that the whole world was only Cerulian and i wasn’t in the world(all laugh),Tony said Misty just wanted you beside and you didn’t come going after all possible imagninary dragons now marry that Zekrom and settle down(all burst into laughter)..which did happen(all burst into laughter)..no you know her behaviour with me it’s just like that and that she wants from the whole world(all laugh)..cause she cherishes me so much(all burst into laughter) that brat is something today told me why certain pokemons don’t talk with her anymore(all laugh) i said they don’t cherish you(all laugh) showed me a hallucination of how she was weak because it was night(all laugh) then went off saying she’s too weak to talk(all laugh)...Braum wisely noted that this was the break up of the century(all burst into laughter) so definitely should be in manuals(all burst into laughter) some brats those two are,so they were brushed aside after a few times they pestered me i just scoffed at them saying don’t disrespect the whole Unova region and it’s mythical legend cause you don’t know a damn thing about them and they have the worse sentiment for you cause they don’t conside you worthy enough to be mentioned but you do that all time in fantasies and myths and all cause of your self created incompetence nothing more a Tapu Koko and Thundurus has beaten innumerable Zekroms(all laugh) and a Talonflame has beaten Reshiram infinitely many times as well(all laugh) and you have a damn Salamence to begin with(all laugh) but because none of these were on Unovan land suddenly it is different(all laugh) and all Unova region top trainers has won or atleast travelled Kanto certainly the electric specialists have have done so(all laugh) but how many have visited Unova from here and got a damn Zekrom(all laugh) performance wise i showed them what Kanto people can do cause 300 best were smoked off you should be making a grand ovation for me in Cerulian(all laugh) and your young flower dream should dance to my tunes to appease me and that’s the reality(all laugh)...sweet(all laugh) Mist dream(all laugh)...right(all laugh)...well she did but privately(all laugh)..and only non psychophysically(all laugh)..my sweet young flower dream..right(all smile),but if all these didn’t get the brats off i said,the biggest reason for loathing me is that you’re afraid of dragons aren’t you(all laugh) so they were off instantly for 4 years(all laugh) NOT PROFESSIONALLY(all laugh) i myself texted and emailed and pestered the 2 brats to death cause they weren’t receiving for 2 days(all laugh) then i said what man a girl and this(all burst into laughter) they themselves said we’re unhappy babysit us(all laugh) i said yeah just don’t ask about my personal life expect my health and location(all laugh) then Brenda and Irene was much grounded Irene for sure(all laugh) Olivia understood my troubles herself calmed Tony boy down,and Flavia the same so i tell Tony and Braum that man you two are too infatuated with me(all laugh) said yeah the bad sight(all burst into laughter) i said yeah i cherish you so much(all laugh) they said yeah we too(all laugh) this got Harris upset(all burst into laughter) so i said sweetie(all laugh),yeah yeah childhood feelings so(all burst into laughter)..i said VIRIZ(all brust into laughter)..’,’hey that’s um..(all laugh)..’,’reserved so whoose whoose beau(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,yeah,BURGAINING(all laugh) and she only used to nickname and joke sometimes YOU TAUGHT HER THIS TONE(all burst into laughter)..’ but Kane never mingles with me for obvious reasons(all laugh) and later Harris once pestered him,THIS BRAT HAS SPOILED MY LIFE(all laugh) he and his Gyarados have spoiled my dear wife,dear sister,EVEN MY PARENTS PATRONIZE WITH ME(all burst into laughter)’ then Harris said from which date(all laugh),’yeah yeah too happy(all laugh) i have to feed these brats that you ride on with your dreams(all laugh)..’ so later i asked Kane,’you broke my heart(all laugh)’,’just vomit it bye(all burst into laughter)’..really sweet sweet Kane darling has no peace anywhere now(all laugh)..’anyway,later after Unova the many gatherings we’ve had once those two most infatuated pests said why were you so angry then(all laugh) i said still asking man(all laugh) then they realized said yeah we were only blinding ourselves and Mist infact did go overboard and all and i said that exact thing i didn’t realize and hence all troubles for me cause all beauty were a weeks vacation here away(all laugh) anyway then Kane was neutral saying the Elite4 system isn’t going smooth all because of the glaring fact that Elite4 heads don’t date at all(all burst into laughter) and so on(all laugh) well Irene was all along very neutral and she had a hard time cause she was only confidence Mist had later(all laugh) Irene was very sad later when Mist was in her final year of very deep depression but all of them said you can’t force either to which she said yeah just awaiting the eruption(all laugh) and my poor Nivy bore the pain with aging arms(all laugh) that brat ever is extremely angry on 2nd brat for that(all laugh) then later Cerulian was hunted down they learnt that realized i’m an extremely critical heart patient now(all laugh) so were too happy(all laugh) Kane called me after get-together said immediately date her(all laugh) i said she will have to ask cause her depression is much cured(all laugh) said yeah still will burgain(all laugh) and Irene infact just said still don’t want to marry her she can’t be sane at all unless has you,i said well be a confident from her side i’m telling you the invitation has been sent she can come even at my home to fix the date only at Pallet cause here they are rather afraid of me(all laugh) and don’t tell anyone cause your hubby since 0 is saying what is the date today Irene(all burst into laughter) Irene was laughing so much said yeah only hope doesn’t teach the posterity(all burst into laughter) anyway,then finally a crook(all laugh) jumps on me,’15 years is very long Ash,are you sure you shouldn’t contact her(all laugh),she won’t girls aren’t like(all laugh) that plus she is being advised and monitored(all laugh)’ and so on i said the please i’ve gone over her don’t drag me in your relationship with her i’ve got nothing to do with her or the place why drag me then eventually it gets heated up with Brock cause as the girlfriend has become former her way down to earth and then to hell(all laugh) must be cleared by me(all laugh) and then Gary was misbehaving(all laugh) and the jackal was being most foxing self(all laugh) whinning after each report that shutting a door means i want to change(all burst into laughter)..and so on(all laugh),eventually my sis knew she was absolutely neutral ever said be calm and her shrew similar though he was trying to give me dating tips during the 1st and 2nd round break (all laugh) so all these were going on for sometimes then i finally go to Safforn cause i had so many psychics i had to have the peace and quiet of Safforn Forest(all laugh) so quote them(all laugh) then Gary eventually takes no time to realize but was whinning here for 4 years that it’s not so easy as in types(all laugh) even to his wife on first day(all laugh) who was here finally Garyed(all laugh) but that was a fact what was happening with us but she day one said none speaks about Ketchum then jumped upon Bulbasaur(all laugh) and each day for two years fondled him so much that that day during the preparations i said we may have to leave this place,they agreed but said that may be i need to stay here cause they were happier than me(all burst into laughter) the reason is that other pests were inside the ball sometimes these pests weren’ means Master is serious(all burst into laughter) so not happy(all laugh)..and my very last brat Incineroar tells me this(all laugh)..so i scoffed that you’re here for least time ask Kingler how long she has been here..yeah but why were so and so inside the balls(all burst into laughter)..i said i see Feraligator is teaching you then..says he said master is an idiot(all burst into laughter)..then got Feraligator who says why you i go into the ball where i can’t plan to express myself(all burst into laughter)..i said you need rest...says,’what rest i’ve last been serious 10 years back(all burst into laughter) i said what about your mate,says,mate was humilitated by so and so brat like this Ultranercozma cause you didn’t let him plan properly(all laugh) mate come up says what is he saying still want to battle(all laugh) then Ultranercozma comes in says the one that got Crawdaunt was that one of girlfriend’s beaus(all laugh) Crawdaunt says no no mere kid(all laugh) if master brat(all laugh) allowed me that chosen brat would’ve attacked his own master(all laugh) Feraligator finally comments Chu was right all along that master brat can’t plan a damn thing but mingling with him too much neither can Chu(all laugh) i said why are you infighting(all laugh) Crawdaunt and Ultranercozma shows a joint hallucination of thousand Chu’s sitting very grave then how Crawdauntogator and Ultranercozma turns them against each other(all burst into laughter) then Feraligator said see that is a good plan(all laugh) Chu only threatens,girlfriend won’t budge to Chu(all laugh),i say you don’t know girlfriend yet,all of them in unison say you know first(all burst into laughter) we’re busy don’t have time to talk(all laugh) then all go cause they ran out of patience after 10 minutes cause it’s not fun(all laugh)..then Spiritomb comes and says a few were in pokeballs are they not afraid of themselves(all laugh)..then Luxray comes and attacks himself then cries saying see your plight sseing mine why have you never let me learn hyper beam(all burst into laughter) so i fled the scene(all laugh)..what a bunch(all laugh)..but the jackal was personal(all laugh) so he won’t stop saying that Cerulian Gym was only ugly not beautiful(all laugh) despite the quote(all laugh) then Brock was in all true honest and ethical(all laugh)..no the Lord was new then created a mayhem here(All laugh) with that size fondled Gary to death(all laugh) anyway then Brock in all honesty says then you may move on and all and his concern was so true which only a crooked philosopher like that can understand cause they’re naive(all laugh) the concern that i couldn’t stay single cause i cherished Mist so much that emotion or longing was my nature won’t go away soon same as my Zekrom(all laugh) cause i cherish Zekrom so much(all laugh)..right(all laugh),and he just abstractly advised and nothing else but that really started the demonboy(all laugh) then next time Brock calls i went to the spot did what i did and to be honest with you all and at present after 6 trillion years with future i have no trouble saying that that was a true damn namecall which i drove away that day(all laugh) and in fact later i thought that the message to the right person was delivered in exactly the worst way but that damn brat if i could find again the real eloquence will shine like for 10 years(all laugh) but the letters could’ve been sent to Brock but i  have so much RESPECT for the whole family(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) and Brock another thing is that after i did what i did using Sabshadow(all laugh) by then they calmed down and wanted to fool around no more battle starved(all laugh) they said like,’um..if these two aren’t battling(all laugh) with us or among(all laugh) then should’nt you allow us to fondle them(all laugh) like what ever Marshadow does one will do(all laugh) and whatever Sableye does another will estimate the right kind of proportion whether Sableye’s actions were being perfectly excecuted or not(all burst into laughter) don’t you think so(all burst into laughter)..i was in that mood and as soon as i come out there brats tell me this(all laugh) i told them lets return Girlfriendrom(all laugh) is waiting to get us(all laugh) so they budged(all laugh) but later the Girlfriendrom herself realized that that’s exactly what she is(all laugh) and thus each flew away(all laugh)..but before that you know what a sight Zekrom was with the might and all now if told says i am too weak to think(all laugh) so really Brock upended the view for which i have to tell people once a month same thing that how to strenly yet politely(all laugh) get higher autority to work for people and then about the emotional managments in-houses for which i’m an expert now(all laugh) and to hear the same thing exactly does the calls come for about 2 minutes per month recycling is most important(all laugh) and then Slate family were alarmed that a naive philosopher was roaming around unVioleted to exactly point this very fact to the Violeted one(all laugh) but during office hours(all laugh) who in return was confessing her longing for her beau whom she saw in a certain gym on a certain occasion with no motives what so ever from both sides(all laugh) and thus she thought that yeah newly dressed but same old naivety(all laugh) so the confessions were going on chiding him away(all laugh) and the philosopher thought that too much work now previously atleast sometimes did switch the number off(all laugh) so he was himself switching off at the right moments(all laugh) but yeah the philosopher himself said that like distance is longing(all laugh) cause all things earthly so close(all laugh)/soulmate is heavenly so just dose(all laugh) anyhow that is verse1 in the praise of naivety(all laugh) and then the great songstar was there who refused to know anything about pokemons despite being a gym leader(all laugh) cause they were too sweet too little too cute too sweet(all laugh) BUT there is a certain pokemon called MANTINE(all laugh and cheers for Mantine) about whom no Mantine including him knows more than Violet does(all laugh) including all attacks and all and she needs 1 month to tame a Ghostradarkarrigussonor as Mantine(all laugh) BUT that isn’t done cause too sweet(all laugh) so she was singing some songs that meant exactly the longing for her soulmate BUT wasn’t doing so in phones(all laugh) so anyway the picture was done by the better rocket herself handwritting is of the lesser that same letter did the double edged trick(all laugh and .)..a habit(all burst into laughter)..David bro surely has told you more than everything about how the pencil was sharpened(all laugh)...by the way getting the family involved also in both cases was inspired by that ONLY but these are just so naive(all laugh)...so first thing the future will know is that dusk is the right time for human-looking-opposite-type activities(all laugh) with enough naivety which is why Duskshadow has been instructed to get the preparation done(all laugh and .) which they did hands on(all laugh) and showed you the test case result(all laugh) Dusknoir is learing about more temporal perfection cause the legendary times are necessary and Marshadow is getting ready for 18 years(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) to estimate the right ratio of the gentle and the wicked(all laugh) as to exactly at what ratio of pestering vs calmness(all laugh) a fox looking like a man changes gears(all laugh) then there’s Conhoopa who is teaching how to get the different meanings of similar looking theings so the general approach rather than one special approach to each that a jackal doesn’t run to hug an enemy sentimentally and LEGALLY(all burst into laughter) cause in university he won’t understand the seats,corners and solutions so will ask me(all burst into laughter) then there’s Darkramar who tells how to be exactly in-between waking and dreaming that is to stay alert and yet emotional and balance it properly rather than patiently waiting till being poked(all laugh) cause he thinks of 2 words(all laugh) yet won’t say cause a professional works only if a trouble arises(all laugh) with wigs(all laugh) so that someone can’t be seen but she can see someone(all laugh) cause she thinks aw..so cute(all laugh) this is to confess to her by asking her age related issues(all burst into laughter),a toast...right(all burst into laughter)...right so then i thought that i should tell mom immediately cause if Brock informs Trace cause them my mom may know(all laugh) to which the the answer was i’ve someone and that was being hindered(all laugh)...Misty Fletch right(all laugh),so when i say i don’t cherish you,’hum..how can you say that you’re only my Ash(all laugh)’..not once says that she cherishes me or i can’t just that i have to be her and so is my sweet Mist(all smile)...right(all smile),i still remember 2nd day itself around afternoon Mist was sitting near me so i tell her do you know how to set a tent(all laugh),’YOU SET IT(all laugh) then anyhow at night comes too close to me(all laugh) i say what are you afraid cause i’m(all burst into laughter) cause i caught Caterprie and Chu was sitting on another side of the tent cause he didn’t like us(all laugh) ‘HUH POKEMON MASTER(all laugh),YOU’LL NEVER BE A POKEMON MASTER UNLESS YOU CAN GET OUT OF HERE(all laugh)’,i said fine lets sleep then i’ll think besides you need reimbrushment as well(all laugh),’um..SHUT UP(all laugh),STAY AWAKE WHOLE NIGHT WE’RE ENDANGERED(all laugh)..AND I’LL NEVER LEAVE YOU TILL YOU REPAY(all laugh)..but um..Ash..um..can i sleep away from the door(all laugh)’...anyway that was done then at night i was lost in thoughts really as Nivy said(all laugh) well at that time he must have as well(all laugh) anyway just didn’t want to sleep or get up thought why life doesn’t pass away me being exactly there lying down looking up forgetting everything then i really was lost we went to sleep at 10 then i kept awake like tat for may be two hours and very small tent we managed but Mist i totally forgot her presence so did’nt know much or really didn’t look mindfully at 12 or 12:30 suddenly someone is absolutely beside me(all laugh) i was scared i called Chu(all laugh) who doesn’t reply(all laugh) then Mist says its me,i said why are you not sleeping says no just woke up too scared(all laugh) i said yeah i’m too but atleast now we can’t do much says,’um..what are you thinking for 2 hours(all laugh)’..i said not much don’t know just a blankness,’um..are you not sure of youself’,’no not about the journey just as to whether it’s needed at all or not can’t i pass my whole life lying down here barely matters’ this is too hard for me still to understand as so many negative emotions come at a subtle way(all laugh) and Mist was intellectual(all laugh) so says,’um..no we have to get out of here atleast i will try i don’t want to die here(all laugh) and so should you unless together we can’t get out of here,i said you have two pokemons who are with you for 6 years or so i have one Caterprie for 1 day and that brat for 2 who is strong enough but doesn’t listen to me(all laugh)...’,’um..no Ash it’s not that but you know just give up these thoughts they come and go all must do something to like..um..live..we need rest we have to get out of this and all the pokemons we need together and you and..um..(all laugh)..me and you(all laugh) must be..um..(all laugh)..working together(all laugh)’,’yeah we’ll see thanks for cheering me up but Misty you will become a gym leader in future here for no reason at midnight a stranger...(all laugh),’um..no nothing just..um..(all laugh)..woke up..it’s alright a bit scared(all laugh)..anyway let’s sleep we’ll need good rest wild pokemons and people want to challenge you out of blue(all laugh)..see you tomorrow,night’...then i was curious(all laugh) a gym leader for a bike which costs a paltry penny(all laugh) and acts lika a Gyarados(all laugh) then at night acts like my mom(all laugh) then i kept thinking that how great a strat a brat of a starter(all laugh) then i thought atleast a Pidgey(all laugh) or like Tyrangaleoveltal in pursuit of happiness(all laugh)..no i’m sorry but these pairings are something you know(all laugh) well i was in pursuit of happiness then(all laugh)...see this want of attack to destroy isn’t it killing inside making you unhappy thinking when you can destroy me then this thirst momentarily will go but will it end again another again another again another(all burst into laughter) so you see this thirst to attack isn’t the way to happiness neither is like if you stay still then you can’t play and all so you see this life is a sad sad sad(all laugh) eventuality(all laugh) BUT(all laugh) if we let these go the thirst ,the want to play and all then where does it end us up BEING WHAT A YVELTAL IS(all laugh) just being a Yveltal gives me joy not what i do by means of the outside this is happiness if cultivated then don’t do anything just the notmal life this thirst to be happy by means of things aren’t good like skirmishes and all just the idea of happiness is the reason why we’re not happy(all burst into laughter,.) but if this idea isn’t there then we’re happy but hey,am i happy(all burst into laughter)...legend of Glaniesoterustom said mate are you a pokemon(all laugh) no i see you’re in search for happiness me too but i don’t like an utter idiot attack people who hasn’t done anything to me of like after me or my group that you’re upto despite your powers what is it that is your problem let me guess this pursuation for happiness(all burst into laughter)..see this want to be happy by some actions rather than normal ones is a trouble is idea that one is happy if he has destroyed another isn’t there cause then the same logic is you should kill yourself to be happy(all burst into laughter) but that you understand is totally useless so to be in the pursuit of happiness(all laugh) this idea of attacking or going after people who doesn’t do a thing or want to is wrong cause then you’re not happy so the pursuit of happiness begins form self introspection(all burst into laughter) which needs again one to be happy(all burst into laughter,.) so to be happy we must be what we are hey,are you happily dreaming(all burst into laughter),legend said take a bow i’m off(all laugh),wait wait wait are you sure there’s a word called happy(all burst into laughter)...then the buffoon tried to jump psyched off cause the legend himself was trying to flee(all laugh) then a bit more legend finally realized that this buffoon wants to fool around only so wanted to play but again couldn’t weak 1 day went off to(all laugh) be IN PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS(all laugh)...what a bunch(all laugh)...Tyranitar said how can i be happy ever everything is all so wrong/and just here look i never called you to battle yet you’re singing the sinister song(all burst into laughter,.) that was it then Solgaleo was most dangerous,legend come cries his head off how can you be happy with so many things going inside the body and mind(all laugh),coming after me for no reason cause you want to be busy(all burst into laughter,.)/as so many things about being you like me makes your mind go hazy/you’ve got so many powers constantly agitates you to be crazy(all laugh)/still your foolishness to battle for no reason and not to think stopping them being lazy(all burst into laughter)...the legend instantly turned on her master(all laugh) then all the same..IN PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS(all laugh)..what a bunch...dark is light/light is dark/happy Mr Oak now now sad did you mark(all burst into laughter,Gary laughs shaking his head)...Mr Oak Mr Oak what are you doing/oh Mr Oak please help me now i’m crying/Mr Oak Mr Oak why is a thing so(all burst into laughter)/tell me why i’m a Zeraora Mr Oak before that don’t dare to go(all burst into laughter,.)...Mr Oak just a bit(all laugh),cause they did the same to legends(all laugh)...”
Gary(laugh) : “i’ll have to ask Dave for a job now(all laugh)..yeah in pursuit of happiness(all burst into laughter)...Dave said i’ll tell the same thing to the competitiors that are exactly here for that reason in pursuit of happiness(all laugh)..so that there’s less brats at a gym(all burst into laughter and .)...Tyrangaleoveltal is something(all laugh)...but Giraora are damn brats(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “good break cause Viridian was that in pursuit of happiness(all laugh)...anyway,so at night then i looked at the clock it was late 12:30 or or and then i knew it’s not so easy to sleep so thought of going out but was too scared(all laugh) so then saw that brat Chu too happily sleeping(all laugh) or feigning(all laugh) then thought that fine atleast try to get a Pidgey cause even mom had one(all laugh) so then looked at Mist whoose sleeping bag is too nearer to me now(all laugh) and is minutely observing me(all laugh) i said what(all laugh),’um..No..no..just(all laugh)..’,’scared’,yeah..just..’,’um..Misty..are you ok..’,’no it’s alright Ash just was looking at..um..(all laugh)..what you were doing..i mean..(all laugh)..’,’yeah just scared you are i’m too(all laugh) but it’s ok will be habituated tomorrow(all laugh) art of life(all burst into laughter) don’t bother just sleep,’night’,’yeah ‘night’..then i thought i’ve heard of and seen infautated brats(all laugh) is this a sample(all laugh)...ok(all laugh),then i was scared more thinking she will eat me up(all laugh) then couldn’t sleep at all(all burst into laughter) and with all i thought she was waiting there conspiring with Chu from before now at night will abduct me(all burst into laughter)..that was something but then i thought at the end of the day yes both her and my family knows that we’re officially travel companions and so are we registered but i find no reason for someone to jump on me who is RICH(all laugh) so she could easily catch a normal transport(all laugh) then i was thinking that why would someone slap me(all laugh) when i only said thanks for saving my life(all laugh) and i saw her about 0 seconds ago first time she may be a 0 minute more(all laugh) so i couldn’t get anything and then i recalled her gazing at me and all then thought that lets see what happens next day morning screechs inside my ears(all laugh) and whole day so many stuffs i get Pidgey then again get lost the 3 rockets jump us then Pidgey evolves in Pidgeoto on the very day may be 3 hours later and saves us from many brats(all laugh) and huge day but at night i was again lost in thoughts a bit and agian this time was alert same thing now was sleeping a feet away from me yesterday was 2(all laugh) and was gazing at me(all laugh) then i thought definitely infauated(all laugh) and then on 4th day Beedrils attack us a brat challenge us then next day the 3 rockets again come so then on 6th we can call and in the meantime i realized that my Mist watches me so minutely as long as she can stay awake and takes care or wants to cause she’s only 16 but that care is exactly like that of my mom whenever i’m lost in thoughts doesn’t disturb me cause she herself is at total bay(all laugh) and her looks towards me ever was like my mom for no reason was so happy but it was strange i never knew what this was i can’t express all were done as if she knows me for eternity too easy too free and my hesitation was the Gyarados(all laugh) but i then realized just a so so sweet sweet girl(all laugh)...right(all laugh),and her trouble was that her Lil sister was pestering her(all laugh) and none was that what she wanted which was me(all laugh) so in general talks fine but somehow can’t control herself around me and always stutters at night that we should be together NOT working(all laugh)..then on 6th she called her friend definitely after she called you and i heard her saying that yeah,Ash is a nice guy very sweet..um..(all laugh) then afternoon we realized next day we’ll be in Pewter to get naive(all laugh) so then i call again Professor this time and Mist too calls then i heard her saying ‘no Ash has got 2 already and so happy to come out of that place,Ash has been very nice to me and my Ash..um..(all laugh)..’ then i reaclled on the 4th night was so hard a buffoon challenged my Metapod with a Metapod(all laugh) then we went to his hut there and at late night i go and all and that day i heard it was 4th day after meeting Mist she told Manuel still remember his name cause that forest was something(all laugh) and had contacts for some months 9/10 then got off long time 20 or so years anyway,then Mist told in a heated conversation cause that brat was a buffoon taking so much risk(all laugh) so Mist said my Ash is much better(all laugh) that neither he nor me bothered much about cause we were challenging(all laugh) and i let Mist down with Metapod vs Metapod(all laugh) and then after that on 6th day i heard and then what i understood her nature to be i realized that only my mom has that sentiment my Ash and none else so this isn’t infatuation atleast(all laugh) may be best friends(all laugh) cause i never considered anyone to be that as you know and all(all laugh) cause it’s professional and personal(all laugh) and semi who knows that Misty Fletch is a farm manager at Hazelex(all laugh) like Cili(all laugh)..Cili(all laugh)..no Cili is something you know like Nivy(all laugh)..some other people knew Misty Fletch is an intellectual(all laugh)..but in Viridian forest i knew surely i have no grils there as friends(all laugh) so it must be girl best friend(all burst into laughter) well to her as well but because she had elder sisters herself and was from a city like yeah(all laugh) Cerulian,whoose one particular school i know more than the students(all laugh) so Mist knew the word boyfriend(all laugh) which to her was that bestfriend is the boyfriend is the husband(all laugh) and to me it was girl friend is professional or personal friend(all laugh) but girl best friend is wife(all laugh) so our better friend confessions was that infact(all laugh) later i realized that girl friend actually is used to denote girl best friend(all laugh) so girl friend is wife(all laugh) cause wife is a girl by gender PHYSICALLY(all burst into laughter) and friend for life thus girlfriend is yeah just my Mist(all laugh) and then that means wife girl friend(all laugh) and when my sis asked the question was do you have a girlfriend after one day of familiarity(all laugh) the answer she expects is exactly my answer yeah just my wife(all laugh) or fiancee(all laugh) so how was the proposal and how will be the proposal(all laugh)..and May was so sweet and simple that she didn’t even understand that finacee means still not the same as wife(all laugh) and she didn’t know what is break-up from a boyfriend as well cause i fed that idea that was when she was 20 and her reaction was how can Drew say i’m not his best friend cause he said so emotionaly(all laugh) i understood that exactly like my flower(all laugh) and shrew as usual will shrew around till he was caught(all laugh) some experience shrew had had with vomits(all laugh) and it’s just amusing really now we both laugh that we know each other as well as bros as well(all laugh) but proposal is exactly why in Unova i should’ve myself wore a ring(all laugh) and thus on that incident immediately defame that brat for 10 years(all laugh) that’s the end of trouble which now i would BUT that’s not the case cause then i couldn’t but Trace i can hear them now Trace(all laugh)...so i was with my wife-friend(all laugh) and she was with her my-hubby-Ash-um-friend(all laugh)..so(all burst into laughter),then we tagged along and i automatically was pulled to her and then nicknamed her just after the 3rd match so happy told me she couldn’t call me hubby um(all laugh)...so(all laugh) couldn’t nickname me(all laugh) cause it’ll make no sense(all laugh)..well none can(all laugh)..then(all laugh) within a month we were better friends(all laugh) and so i in the last months of Johto understood that our bond was so strong we forget any words to express it cause words are distubing to us when we’re with each other but not alone(all laugh)..and thus realizing i thought why bother anyway we’re best friends(all laugh)..then a damn jackal couldn’t get married(all laugh) so he conspired by means of second cousin mask(all laugh) and used my flower as a VEIL(all laugh) thus she was at Cerulian(all laugh)..AH!THE THE DREAM(all laugh)...ok(all laugh),well the dream as taught is being naive now(all burst into laughter)...so(all laugh),after i come back then by the time i confessed to her that she was my girlfriend-wife(all laugh) and if she wants i can call her that(all laugh) by then i realized our bond in a way very strong and realized that my Ash from day one was her life really but that was not enough so broke off that mask and then that picture heavy thing(all laugh) that was there then Kalos again and all then fully realized who my Mist was really to me and viseversa and imediately almost realized everyone that i knew personally including you all and my mom as well and all the stuffs then jumped on Cerulian(all laugh)..Dave told you 1002 times now(all laugh) when i got into the gym for almost one and half months by then whole city was in red alert(all laugh) and had my Mist fully covered if one brat entered the gym misbehaving would’ve been caught(all laugh) cause you know the staffs were instructed and our Vickie and Hana too that either brats stop or the gym is under trouble and each brat was warned officially(all laugh) which is now there with PRIVATE constraint such as appeasing a Garchomp(all laugh) and so on and by the about 2 weeks from the break-in to my marriage here that week the whole city knew that the implications are very difficult to understand(all laugh) cause of all people the most dreaded playboy is hunting for heads now(all laugh) with 2 Elite4’s and roaming around with ghosts(all laugh) entering living rooms with Giratina and if pressed will release a Hoopa and an Ultranercozma(all laugh) so they just couldn’t believe it but later i came back after the Unovan Cilian(all laugh) even yesterday told him that look in Unova everything is getting rebuilt can i go there again(all laugh) said yeah come for 4 years now challange every home(all laugh) so Mist was totally protected in that 2 months from even Mewtwos(all laugh) and also then i did what i did in the lab with you same reason that i knew our relations and so on but those 2 months were fun and just wished that the same protection was given later but it is alright doesn’t matter so anyway to return to break up after,before i got Brock my things were packed off to Safforn and went back then eventully first Trace called and actually didn’t know himself why he called(all laugh) then says like i was in 301st gym in my mind(all laugh) but actually it was 302(all laugh) and so on so then i was more incensed and told him what i did and then finally Gary calls says keeping your bunch here is hard cause surroundings have become too beautiful(all laugh) then i played a sentimental card(all laugh) that i knew my bunch would never get anywhere in mars the jackal to fox them and the impersonal to babysit them to his utter disgust(all laugh) and they were in the last 3/4 years of their careers and they needed my bunch so a deal(all laugh) and thus then mom was after me(all laugh) that how can it take 6 dates and not 5(all laugh) so anyway finally i told mom to look for informations on young flower dream and then tell me about other a thing(all laugh) so she gets it then(all laugh) professor was stern i said and only because of Professor i could say i said why would it matter if i reject my girlfriend and don’t try to find another cause al these guys except Gary is telling me to patch up or go elsewhere why are they so obsessed with my personal life no matter what i never advised them on theirs just a few leg-pulling or fun(all laugh) and then to mom i said that look if their friendship with me depends on my relationship with someone else it’s far better to cut off this finally took mom down to mom-plane from mom-in-law plane(all laugh) so Professor consented to me to keep my bunch and all then comes Trevor and undercover i have to make a huge will confessioning my longing to each person in the world(all laugh) that i didn’t understand a thing about(all laugh) but then i thought that just two three months i didn’t want to jump into undercover without atleast contacting Mist for once more to see if there is anyway to get back or not this was my longing for my soulmate cause this i did totally unintentionally but called the gym(all laugh) i didn’t even know that Mist never blocked me like myself either(all laugh) i just deleted it didn’t block and Mist kept it by writing associeted notes(all laugh).. just my name wasn’t there it was written Deleted as too close(all laugh) so anyway the gym was called i was told that ‘mam was busy battling(all laugh)...but then those diaries that i stole(all laugh)...fine(all laugh),all your yearning ALL FAKE(all laugh),but um..my hands are a aching a bit today(all laugh),huh Ketchum enough with you we’re done IMMEDIATELY CALL ME SWEETIE(all laugh) when my sweet bug said i’ve a broyfriend get lost,yeah with Mist right(all laugh) that was enough(all laugh)...right(all laugh),then said you’re jealous YOU NEVER CHERISD ME YOU WANTED REVENGE SO BROKE MY HEART FAKING YEARNING,i’ve reimbrushed(all laugh),Ash i’m your new girlfriend right(all laugh),the answer is yeah just forgot that wife is also girl(all burst into laughter) but my Mist looked so sweet when she was sleep powdered and i fondled her hairs(all laugh)...right(all laugh),Bulbasaur was taking care of her with Dark gang including Greninja so each time they sleep power and i instruct them again and all while fondling her hairs as she was sleeping in my arms only(all laugh) and i took the ring size there as well(all laugh) Bulbasaur and others in conference opined as i was fondling her hairs when she was sleeping or when she was awake and too agitated i hugged her(all laugh) means when she is calm fondle her when agitated agitate more to fondle her(all laugh) to again make her calm down(all laugh) so to calm her down permanently why don’t i agitate her while constantly hugging her and fondling her hairs(all laugh) then she was trying to hold traditions while i namecalled her(all laugh)...right(all laugh) so i forced her off which increased the agitation then the reverse process so why don’t i agitate her while hugging her very gently and yet letting her do what she wants(all burst into laughter) the dark gang had Gengar,Sableye,Marshadow,Spiritomb,Greninja,Hoopa,Darkrai,Malamar,Confragigus,Dusknoir(all laugh) Gengar says why this girl so serious(all burst into laughter) master just wants to fondle her alone(all burst into laughter) cause she is trying to fondle the master too sudden(all burst into laughter)...yeah(all laugh),comrade says,yeah but when we do so(all burst into laughter) master isn’t angry(All laugh)...so(all laugh) she rather than directly bodyslamming must tickle him first then(all uncontrollably laugh)...right(all burst into laughter)..so(all laugh)...anyway(all laugh)...yeah(all laugh) and she’s trying to suddenly appear before master(all burst into laughter)...right(all laugh),but can’t get into the right planes of darkness(all laugh) master should i help her(all burst into laughter) then the disagreement comes let her off can’t you see we are doing all thsese and master is fondling her now or when we don’t know what some signals are cause master is telling her to not get agitated while he agitates her(all burst into laughter) cause one should one be afraid of herself(all burst into laughter) the unknown signals like when the master repeats certain words so many times why is she getting more agitated each rather than admitting those words(all burst into laughter) to take it further to prove(all burst into laughter) this happens only when you don’t admit that you should afraid of yourself(all laugh) which is questioned again does she know the right proportion of being so cause Spiritomb is afraid not serious(all burst into laughter) no you see you have to understand the meaning of seriousness(all laugh) why we’re not getting her some signals is because she can’t interpret that master wants to fondle her(all laugh) so in her mind it seems that master wants to battle but these humans are foolish enough to be obsessed with responsibility(all burst into laughter) which means you have to unnecessarily battle for no reason and then get agitated for no reason but strangely when you cool down then only bodyslam(all burst into laughter)..right(all laugh),to me the meaning is those who act like this master brat(all laugh) and this brat is doing are idiots(all burst into laughter) no you see it’s just the picture of the master to this girl is not right(all laugh) like master should look like me(all laugh) then may be this girl will get the right sentiments(all laugh),master are you getting her picture right or should we mess up her dress and hair(all burst into laughter) no no don’t disturb the master brat(all laugh) he’s agitated this girl is so important like us(all laugh,.) but this girl currently is half calm half not(all laugh) cause master has different signals on being sleep powdered so basically this girl doesn’t undertsand whethere she’s sleeping or awake thus is serious(all burst into laughter) cause she doesn’t know who she is(all burst ito laughter) before sleeping she knew she will get agitated so will have to sleep now sleeping but knows will be awake who is she master(all uncontrollably laugh),the time(all burst into laughter) cause she isn’t stable(all uncontrollably laugh,.,tears,fits of laughter) like Bulbasaur(all uncontrollably laugh and fits of laughter)..what a bunch that is and what a brat Dusknoir is(all laugh)..,yeah i’ve been born and brought up in a gym and my mom was with master later came here but everywhere it’s known that if you’re a Gengar the moment you’re responsibile you’re no more so(all burst into laughter) what is it Bulbasaur that you’re obsessed with responsibility(all laugh)..no just ego(all burst into laughter),doesn’t know the right proportion to balance it and so wants to boss us around Bulbasaur who is stronger than whom...now Bulbasaur’s assistant Bayleaf(all laugh) goes,’aww..(all laugh)..Bulby are you unhappy with them(all burst into laughter)..don’t bother about them they don’t understand grass sentiments(all laugh) a grass is about being jovial(all burst into laughter)..Bulby are you hungry(all burst into laughter)’,Bulbasaur finally realizes that the pests are getting impatient cause this scene is boring them(all laugh) so Bulbasaur says,’Greninja has been silent but your trouble is that none understand that i’m you and you’re the same(all burst into laughter)..’,now Greninja is cunning(all laugh),says,’Bulbasaur surely Bayleaf has all your attacks and Butterfree can sleep powder better in Kalos the grass isn’t brown(all burst into laughter)’..Bulbasaur says,’are you ethically honest(all burst into laughter) are you happy(all laugh) cause the hapiness that Gengar is taking about is a well distributed dating plan to get a beau to remind him what he thought just the previous moment if asked properly(all burst into laughter)..’,then Gengar says,’rather than sleep powdering to calm seriousness down,surely you can tickle her with vine whips(all burst into laughter)’ Sableye says master can i show him(all laugh),the time(all burst into laughter .),since when we’ve been forced to be eating substandard food seriously(uncontrollably laugh and .)..Dusky is something you know(all laugh)..legend came said you came here for no reason but at this time isn’t your beau waiting(all burst into laughter)..then i finally say this is grildfriend(all laugh),’mere kid(all burst into laughter) doesn’t know in Kalos if you’re serious you’ll be rejected(all burst into laughter and .)’...so i said yeah enough break tell me well in advance when she is getting up,’can i show her Confragigus fights to scare her to wake up quicker(all burst into laughter)’ i said shut up or i’ll send each of you back home(all laugh) you dance there(all laugh) and bring girfriend with choised beaus so that we can counter(all laugh)...and these were going on and when Mist woke up all were set back to demon boy(all laugh)...right(all laugh),i knew her condition then what i was doing and what was going inside her and me and all just didn’t want to stop hugging her but she had to understand that(all laugh) and my brats were doing these(all laugh) so i got off after agreeing to joing the busting operating and went undercover where only Dave as i said knew and all then came out and two totally separate world i saw all beds were being readied for me once more after being compelled to a hunderd if not thousand(all laugh) and i loathed it and then all things about young flower dream was foisted upon my face as soon as i went to Safforn(all alugh) and i just didn’t realize the how can the whole world be too small for 2 people to live separately and then decided to go to Kalos and there university and court cases and 3 damn brats(all laugh) no Clemont as you know excellent guy by all means and his sis was just a kid and is totally out of service now(all laugh) and senor was the brat actual(all laugh) never understood that this profession isn’t for her cause her talents were too good everywhere else except this(all laugh) so Kalos was going on where the fool around nature finally became as natural as living itself to my bunch and i got all the time in the world cause each of my 10 there came by themselves and i knew the word battle in meaningless to me and my bunch so i pestered Gary(all laugh) cause now i was thinking about legends and their stuff and all and Kalos being Kalos many female and male brats came around was shown the bed of fire(all laugh) but i still fuelled the image cause i wanted to chew up each such brat that existed then during Elite4 travels i was like Gengar really(all laugh) and thus never liked anything grave personally emotional(all laugh) yeah Cerulian gym’s news never came in Kalos i was so happy(all laugh) then i go to Unova beautiful men come around(all laugh) and again whole world became Cerulian gym and in Johto and Orange and Hoenn i was shoved with the idea that Misty Waterflower was the judgement day saviour herself(all laugh) and so on i only thought send her to that lake with a herd of Buzzwole and you’ll see who saves you(all laugh) and these were going on a few pictures(all laugh) i had to see which were too cosmeticed(all laugh) and it was said that you can young flower dream be such great battler that too with a Gyarados(all laugh) but never that Ms Misty Waterflower such a great battler and gym leader how talented she is she can perform in water shows so well this never came unless the right treatment was served together(all laugh) during Unova Cili was pestering me that how can a mere mortal of a 4 league champ with 153 hall of fame Sinnoh badges and that thunder-chair record(all laugh) be anywhere near the heavenly empress YET not contact her frequently(all laugh) and he was himself seeing what my bunch was doing(all laugh) so these were going on you know Cili fled the scene just the day after the final(all laugh),Iris the next day but she didn’t flee atleast(all laugh) happily congratulated and thanked me and i’m just so happy to hear that she won the Hoenn league and all cause she really deserved it and now settled so best wishes but Cili suddenly appeared at of all places Unova Elite4 HQ(all laugh) which means it was lion’s den cause i was mythical creature there(all laugh)...Marking in Huntelion..what a distributed man(all laugh)...anyway,i said yeah 4 years how many gyms 760(all laugh) he just wanted some too many professional help(all laugh) and all ever kept in more than good touch with Brock but then i told him in Kalos i did 230 hall of fames(all laugh) infact he realized in 4 years after getting all his certificates and still managing his gym for 6 more months(all laugh) that really both he and me should’ve kept in touch and knew i was rather hurt cause i didn’t break the relation myself so he had to jump in fire(all laugh) and this is just the week before i could have a glance at beauty(all burst into laughter) so then Cili calls,’um..Mr Ketchum..’, i spoke formally then cause didn’t know what to expect and then he comes in realized he should be fondled with(all laugh) and Cili was actually my relief in those days ever can get under his skin just like a Mr jackal(all laugh) and by proxy Daisy too(all laugh) cause all wants that exactly(all laugh) and the crook is too easy to fondle anyway but the greatest fun is in how an impersonal man can find it hard to make ends meet(all laugh) a game really(all laugh) so thus i’ve created a schism among the directors and also the sisters(all laugh) and it rhyms(all laugh) then finally saw a picture of Mist and realized that she was my wife for eternity not as Misty(all laugh) and so i was just being foolish then not to abduct her(all laugh) came back immediately first encirling the whole Cerulian City via 2 Elite4s and rest and all here then married my Mist again for 35 th time as usual(all smile) so this was the gateway to demonboy appearence professor please,”
Gary(laugh) : “ this brat is after me really(all laugh) and spoiled my flower as well now(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “well this is a true gift bro legal procedures aren’t happening UNLESS those nests are inside room(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “i guess Gili will want his room in the nests(all laugh)...”
Lillie(laugh) : “then i’ll shake your flower’s hand with ulterior motives(all burst into laughter)...”
Daisy(laugh) : “well this little pest is also a meance to family unity(all laugh)”
Tracey(laugh) : “but i must thank him really(all burst into laughter)
Violet(all laugh) : “me too too easy to trap(all laugh)”
Brock(laugh) : “it’s unfair Ash,i’ve done 5 regions that jackal only 1(all laugh)”
Ash(laugh) : “for emotional management without looking at concerned persons is impossible without jackals who if breaches the 10 ft circle will be Banetshadowed(all laugh)...anyway,so now it’s demonboy(all laugh)..but only tomorrow(all laugh)...see you all with only Professor Mr Oak as now Dr Gary wig Oak(all laugh)..bye(all reciprocate and bye)..”
................................................................................................................................................................
(4 days later,night,mid conversation)

Gary(laugh) : “well this will be a long discourse too,first,’Ash,i know what you told Tracey and Brock,the trouble isn’t that the trouble is your bunch has to be here unless you have got other ideas.’,’well,it depends on Professor,Gary,if they can’t forget my personal relations with them no matter how homely and how long i’m sorry but i can’t help it.But you all are absolutely top professionals and you know the rest.if personal matters aren’t involved hardly ever a trouble for me as you know.’,’well you know your bunch is also important for us and viseversa thus grandpa also agrees to continue the professional relationship and i do realize very well what you told me VIA quotes(all laugh) AND why the others were scoffed off for not being me in dealing with you(all laugh) my only question is that she will pester me no matter what after a certain point,if that’s too much for me i’ll stop contacts with you completely by all means cause you know why the other way around won’t be possible(all laugh) and then it’s just about the staffs and grandpa then.’,’of course not a trouble no problem i really hope she doesn’t pester you..and you know this is the demonboy in all means cause after 15 years what he says despite in his heart what he ever has and i knew that as well..i hope you can continue there as you’ve been for last 10 years,and i’m sure there’ll be no darth of boyfriends for someone with looks and skills and virtues still if she pesters around then i can’t help obviously,then yes it’ll be about the staffs.thank you Gary,have a nice day.”...he never told any of us where he was travelling only shuffled his bunch and during undercover most were taken off to Kukui Lab and so on later Lycanroc and all came but whole world knew his whereabouts then(all laugh)...with us personally just total disconect..never spoke much to even aunty except just health newses and about finance etc...and finances you know all about it(all laugh) we realized that no professionaly and personally he is same but may be our personal relationship to him was permanently cut off cause i understood the pest can’t be himself in core no matter what he does but not that without his wife for eternity(all laugh) and the viseversa same(all lugh) and used to call Trace by surname and viseversa and they never wanted to talk to each other and mostly was shifted to the staffs and Trace only once out of his natural emotion and character asked during his Orange Elite4 about the island name and was mouthed off saying personal questions are traps to get him emotionally unstable so that he now has to forsake his career(all laugh) then Trace of all was very dejected and told me that it’ll become impossible for us if he doesn’t shift his bunch..May of all people in her then infrequent contacts with Mist and a few others told she can’t believe what she was told after knowing Ash for 13 years and their bro-sis relation was ever so cherished by Ash then just mercilessly cut that off...he hardly had any connections with us.Grandpa was told to tell the staffs not to ask a single question on personal matters and to Grandpa he was never impolite but showed his uneasinesss to a huge degree by just skipping questions and he became totally elusive to us and i only could talk with him utmost professional and nothing else then in the last days as soon as he entered Kanto even i was told to call him by surname and viseversa and his bunch was getting impossibly and extremely jovial and he the opposite day by day not when in press(all laugh)...Grandpa ever said it can’t be like this and he is trying to totally erase off any personal memory which will only force him to lunacy...and he as you know himself wanted it and then Lil was at my ears after that incident with aunty and Misty in those last 3/4 months followed suit with confining herself inside the Gym and all those...we were so happy with our own families but we were seeing how the two reasons for the family just dying the eventual death and we saw Misty so knew her condition and Ash was just like a volcano waiting to bust upon the whole pokemon world at anytime and his bunch was exactly opposite...and we first hand knew his bunch’s powers and Giratina and Zeraora has been playing their games with me since then itself(all laugh) just the namecall was lacking(all laugh)..so we were just counting days and that’s all...Grandpa told him about a month before his return that Daisy and Lillie were his two grand daughter-in-laws and thus he came to know about them after 1 and 2 years of marriage and then pressed aunty to say if they were the ones who were involved in the skirmish(all laugh) and aunty just told him that i’m not leaving my hom no matter who you are(all laugh) so he gauged the situation(all laugh) i was just asked after that in details about his contract so i realized he knows the names(all laugh)..and you know the rest how he extracted it though his dark gang(all laugh)..i can never forget that stuff when he himself foisted him upon us even during that 10 day preparation here before Unovalution(all laugh) that Lil later said i don’t understand why would he ask me questions of schooldays(all laugh) but atleast we had some illusion Trace was something else(all laugh)..Trace that bit please cause now it’s all fun and you know what i’m going to say isn’t and infact we’ve been made internationally famous too(all laugh) and today too much time is given(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “first he calls me from Pinkenberry,’Trace Unova impatient(all laugh)’ i was distraught after two days of that much fun and emotion changes(all laugh) then told me had to go and i realized it then i said why don’t you go to Kukui lab straight then in turns do the instructions rest just send me three best tickets and that’s it(all laugh) said no that won’t help the Capxexil i guess i said yeah untill we know the poison level sure as that’s 7th (all laugh),yeah max possible cause that’s the vulture’s head(all laugh) with a Dispoptas under a Pidgey tan(all laugh) i said then no chance for Kukui Lab to break customers away(all laugh) then Dave was called by him and then he got the full list out and then we were told Mr Oak almost was losing it(all laugh) i somehow fed his lioness(all laugh) so was down then he returned and i return to his room 2 days after the date(all laugh) but thank God Dave was there this time(all laugh) but sadly outside the room first(all laugh) this time again all were driven off and our meals brought in and he only had Greninja with him in the room cause she atleast won’t disturb us when we and she were eating together atleast(all laugh) then this date goes on from 21:30 to 5:30(all laugh) and beside in the ghostly room full psychic gang was there barring Mime(all laugh) who were told to seriously get more jovial so they were discussing among themselves(all laugh) and in lab other brats were doing so the dark ones like Tyrangaleoveltal and Metagross,Trevenant etc that couldn’t get in the house(all laugh) Decidueye got in but told just a matter of most beautiful looking beauty AH!that beauty(all burst into laughter) to which Trevenant said all matter of having the ability to look where’s they if no look(all burst into laughter) so they were fed the serious word so they didn’t disturb us or the lab(all laugh) and Dave by then was in detailed talk with Persy and Unovan greats(all laugh) and i was first told this will be too jovial a meeting else his brats will beak his head off while facing legends killing all(all laugh) then i’m asked how long registration stuff takes(all laugh) i said 2 hours to 3(all laugh) was very happy said the only seriousness man Mist never is a Gengar(all burst into laughter) then we talked about all things Dave got in and we could barely walk at 6(all laugh) so he sleep powdered us and went to subtle body thus he woke up at 9 and we at 11(all laugh) by then breakfast was ready and as was Mr Oak and Professor(all alugh) with all foods imaginable(all laugh) so we again have our meeting the whole day except the breaks till 23(all laugh) when finally all again disperse and then all those starts and finally two days before registration Dase comes up to me at night totally baffled(all laugh) says what sort of a pest is this(all laugh) i say why says first gravely apologized to me then gave me innumerable contacts of psychic type trainers experts and so on excluding Sabrina(all laugh) and said i’ve eavesdropped your personal life since you became a gym leader(all laugh) i realized the psychic hypnotism stuff so was taken aback a bit(all laugh) said no the door isn’t closed(all burst into laughter) so i realized what sort of a pest this is(all laugh) cause Mist invited me saying serious stuffs and door isn’t closed means i’m atleast spared for being PHYSICALLY different to my hubby(all burst into laughter) and he was standing in furthest corner me nearest to door with no pokemons anywhere around cause they were all at lab or inside with Mist(all laugh) so i then laughed and said is telling everything to everyone necessary to necesseciate(all laugh) said no i must say the full picture cause legends are not patient by any means(all laugh) then Dase said,my whole life was refoisted upon me(all laugh) and then she said after that was finally out of room(all laugh) and Mist came up and gravely said all cause the registration has be uninsinuated(all laugh) so i was baffled as to did we hurt him this much(all laugh) Mist again in same voice said no it’s just me(all laugh) can’t get over the fact that he is at a level that i’m not at(all laugh) thus no matter how hard he tries this idea is gripping him that he is superior to me in certain aspects cause i looked like a sweet girl totally dependent upon him when i was trying to describe his level to him from my understanding thus the share isn’t equal so has to prove that he cherishes me and has the next warmest feelings for all of you without patronization(all laugh) and this is going on since the marriage day itself(all laugh) as i said he himself totured me like that to derive the emotions and each time i was aghast and deflated as i felt another small landmass has been sweept aside from under me by this devillish ocean and thus fell into further depth of mental agony all that is coming back to haunt him now and with that each time i was dejected due to him or in front of him no matter his actions then or later as well are coming back to him with the 4 years plight that i was in which i forgot but he refuses to let go off without going through that again and again(all laugh) and these all since that moment when he first refused me as i said come back to me(all laugh) and thus his own superior level is torturing him now and so before registration even more so don’t know what should be the words to describe me and you all to himself(all laugh) i just shook my head and hugged Mist saying hope that Unova finally forgets him for good as soon as possible(all laugh) then i was more baffled before i returned cause Jellicent and Glalie who were my travel companions cause i was too little to walk alone for 10 minutes without ghosts(all laugh) who were saying if i knew the beauty already of handling water types why not know the fire types as well so that i may join them in serious discussions that they were forced to understand in an idiotic monotonus voice too long heard and worn out as the brat is serious these days to wrongly counter the new imported pest whoose gym was too responsible making them ugly(all burst into laughter) i understood that these pests might be the reason why my bro-in-law despite all that he represents can’t stay happy with humans most dear to him(all laugh) cause these pests has overgrown themselves and Unova was the exact culprit(all laugh) so then i returned dejected but before parting the same pests told me do you know girlfriend cause we’re told we will be able to know girlfriend type as well but don’t understand how can she be bautiful cause all of you are too serious going against the laws of searching jovially for that beauty(all burst into laughter) so i realized their master brat was baiting them to be more jovial by getting them serious now only and means he himself is laughing in his head when he says the serious stuffs as he did laugh a few times as well in front of me(all laugh) but before that untill he says he is not happy so he is letting all things out thus i was baffled as to will he now describe every single day of all of our lives including his own(all laugh) so Dase were saying these i didn’t know what to do(all laugh) then next day i was summoned(all laugh) and i’m told whatever he could extract by those pests and in the end was dejected saying man am i a freak(all laugh) i said just get namecalled married tomorrow(all laugh) too happy immediately(all laugh) just to check the confidence level on my freakishness surely a freak cause those pests are(all laugh) i said enough with your validation what is your trouble exactly even at this point said no man Mist was dissolved in me as soon as she got in my presence but i doubted her till the next day you know(all laugh) i said and hence your self doubt till you got Pidgey who evolved into Pidgeoto(all laugh) but don’t let the Pidgeot version anywhere near you during registration(all laugh) said no Gengleye will be(all burst into laughter) but when Pidgey evolved the very first day after so few hours why would he Trace(all burst into laughter) i said soulmate theory or what(all laugh) said yeah i thought why would Mist slap me unless my best friend(all burst into laughter) but still wasn’t sure cause she was blind(all laugh) but yeah i waited for a month till i called her Mist it hurts you know(all laugh) i said then from registration onwards marry her each moment you see her(all laugh) then after registration Mrs Oak Mrs Oak was summoned(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “at first i was there in front of Mist cause i had Gili so thankfully the door was closed to relieve Ketchum(all burst into laughter) then Mist gravely went out and the door was kept open but totally open so that my voice is vividly heard(all burst into laughter) by then i was at total bay(all laugh) then i’m born again of course(all laugh) says you were most influenced by Mist’s gentle big sister personality cause you were too sweet to not rush to the conclusion that outward frivolity will scoff people off(all laugh) i said well i’m out of illusion for a very long time why the supplimentary prizes(all laugh) said no no Gili is hurt(all laugh) and i didn’t help any of you despite having the knowledge that all of you were too sweet whenever you were with pokemons and that is the real nature cause a brat like me winning 2 leagues by luck and handing utter brats(all laugh) should’ve had the guts to talk about serious matters to my girlfriend’s elder sisters cause i was meeting this and that brat in the authority levels and could atleast tell them to give protections against gym brats(all laugh) and Sarah and Brauch i saw too wise people just were too affectionate and that’s cause of your real natures that too i realized as i realized Mr Oak being Gary Oak was here for himself nothing else(all burst into laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) as was Mr Skechit as Tracey(all laugh) but my infatuation with my girlfriend’s less dark skin was the trouble for me as for 8 years i saw that many times and it seemed only more less dark no matter her plights off it(all burst into laughter) so i went in brushing you and Daisy aside by using the same ego that should’ve been used to force the authority but was used upon you rather and shamelessly proposed my girlfriend cause of so and so(all laugh) so i didn’t help anyone including my girlfriend as well hence these must be said before going off that i was nothing but another brat who got the leeway for being a travel companion to the youngest sister(all laugh) no matter what you may perceive me to be now(all laugh) then i understood this pest isn’t going to stop till he proves that he is worthy enough for me to have two words with(all laugh) then goes on with schooldays(all laugh) and the language was abstract to just point to that FEELING(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing)..then says Mr Oak was same as well as Gary Oak(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) but he was wrongly accused so rather quickly was out of is confusion but whole city was cruel to me and so on(all laugh) which he said if questions insinuate Mist’s performance career will be shown to them in abstractly chosen language to give the full answer(all laugh) i didn’t say anything cause he was so eager to chew my birthplace up(all laugh) and he did that before and after(all laugh) then says all else were helped by Mist’s character and even Brock cause he was too naive before(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing)..was more firm later during breaks in negotiations of suspiciously ethical nature(all burst into laughter) but the only person who has this infatuation that he still needs inspiration is a Mr Skechit(all laugh) who for this very reason will be told to stay stationed at the lab till all newses are known cause he will get personal with the whole world otherwise(all laugh) cause this man never needed inspiration exactly which understanding makes him search for exactly that(all burst into laughter,Tracey laughs shaking his head) thus Gary will have to go out to places if need be and Brock will as well but Gary may try to do what he does if agitated so feed him well then(all laugh) then again apologized to both me and Gili for baiting Mr Oak with Magmortgolem(all laugh) cunningly(all laugh) then the rest of my life was reviewed Dase was fed her whole life from her own feelings point of view and my feelings were judged from the point of view of my surroundings(all laugh) and then as usual i’m told like we all now too well know that his bunch will kill him rather us(all laugh) and if he isn’t honest with them then in subtle states they will fumble cause they will not get human emotions(all laugh) and again i was given innumerable contacts on psychic specialists(all laugh) also i was told that the mobbing incident as aunty had to face here was his fault cause Mime needed more time with him to protect his mom by understanding the difference between age related isuues of in hallucination objects and how to manipulate them(all burst into laughter) and grandpa was rather flustered cause that mobbing was a sudden influx of random people who were linking him to certain people now that he was at Kanto so grandpa thought may be he did go too far as that Kalos incident and his subsequent words were still fresh in his mind thus hesitated for a moment as to what he should do then cause some staffs themselves weren’t happy thus hindered him(all laugh) and whoose fate we all know as they were shown the appocalypse(all laugh) a day in the life of bullied at hostel Spiritomb(all laugh) with the problem solver Bronzong(all laugh)and the total revamp made sure the current group knows very well which sort of pests they are handling(all laugh) and are chosen brats themselves(all laugh) and Gary wasn’t there and Trace then realized it when he came to know after 10 minutes later when they tried to enter the lab section when he showed them the door gently(all laugh) but now we know thankfully Mime wasn’t the current version(all laugh) else it would’ve been a day in the life of responsibility in turns(all laugh) and we were involved in that situation with aunty and the subsequent was as usual his fault cause he never bothered to ask about the names of the the spouses of his comrades else he would’ve declared that he will only marry Misty Waterflower from Crulian City gym if the press can find out that certain Unovan brat who jumped him to cancel his marriage with this person(all laugh) exactly why he didn’t bother to ask though(all burst into laughter) cause Mist is less dark PHYSICALLY(all laugh) then said,look i know you're so happy that mom will be there in the renovated plans which will go on despite me and now even more cause mom won't stay at home then and neither would Mist as you know,all of my contacts are with Mist and Dave if she doesn't want to stay as gym leader pick any choised brat from anywhere(all laugh) and provisions are there none can stop Dave from getting here as long as atleast Mime is alive(all laugh) who also ensures no brats will come here at all,Mist will be here too but then she needs personal care hence Chu had to be with her and even if she jumps into any rescue missions Chu will be there and Mime will be here for sure as long as mom is and she may try to do something if i don't return or something happens to Mist then only Mime is going out,you are looking after her so just ensure that doesn't happen and my nephew will help the deal for his mom as well(all laugh) but before all let me clarify mom's position on that incident that you and Daisy were unfortunately involved cause i was conscious at Unova that Mist is less dark(all laugh) i by then realized what Gengar i was sistering(all laugh) so i said,please Ash just let it off we all only want you to be here that's all you know said,yeah i only guess they decided to come here at Cerulian,certainly Capxexil would've been with Gary by now(all laugh) but i must be cleared you see as there i really will need to be Gengar to return as the same if the chance is given even then(all laugh) then i realized his pain actually of frivolity(all laugh) so i said yeah go on(all laugh) then said yeah mom's view of the Sensational Sisters was ever like normal people and you know very simple and caring person never thought much about the press cause after all Daisy sure has been a gym leader for a very long time and Violet whole world knows(all laugh) then Mist is known to her for 16 years regardless of her relation to her as well(all laugh),so as usual the burden falls on you(all laugh) Cerulian already as you know got one dose of medicine with the press that discretely said the behaviour meant they epitomized the namecalls(all laugh) but just wish another would've been given to settle the issue down that always after people cause of my not me(all laugh) which was given later though that truely has cleared our path to do anything there(all laugh) then he said,yeah that day suddenly Daisy found out Mist's behaviours and movements weren't really alright and hence pressed her and all and found () out was on them for 2 months already few brats pestered her on the issue of marriage after my beau and bro type dissection(all laugh) she was travel companion and the brats got the Sinnoh trophy and McShin cup infoes so was linking now(all laugh) i drove them off from me with choised language as well which didn't help her either and then she started using stuffs then that would've made even May chide at mom what to speak of you and then you only ever didn't talk much that's all she herself was at bay as to what is to be done i just told her just let the journey finish once i get atleast 90 to Kukui lab rest will be fine and they won't say anything and she told me you two were too sweet just too much was too much and then she only ever thought great of Daisy and was like her daughter and like May in that sense was ok but you with Gary raised a few eyebrows here and there(all laugh) yeah even that was reviewed now and you know what happened then after he returned(all laugh) those i wish had the time to tackle cause there's a campaign against you for may be 15 years now(all laugh) then gave me few source names and all then said just if you wish study them and so on i'll see who accuses you of being ill-prepared to handle pokemons at a lab then gave me his own notes and all that you know has Palkian life realizations written so that huge volume is with me and hence i now can talk with Mr Oak Mr Oak equally well hence his plight has increased with traps cause previous report reviewing for specific 6th time excuses doesn't work anymore all done in 4 or 7(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) then he said thus i told mom directly after introducing her to Dave that do you believe Gary is unworthy to be my twin cause i feel the treatment Trace gets he doesn't(all laugh) she realized it to be the soulmate theory so the names were psychophsically hallucinated with the relations as well(all laugh) and thus scoffed at me as usual saying too much self inflicted obsessive density is why you were about to lose your wife just shut up(all laugh) so i said then you agree to go there at lab with 6150 arcs at maximum legally provisioned having this home of ours included which being totally renovated now will shelter your just found son Dave and daughter-in-law Zara while you go to your daughter-in-law Lillie and give her and your son Gary the relief you know they both want from their mom(all laugh) this hallucination package ever works with mom you see(all laugh) i said,what is hallucinating in this(all laugh) the actual idea is to have one more but Trevenant sized ghostly room so(all laugh) then i said won't be able to see it then(all laugh) then we laughed but i also realized why Gengars have the patience span of absolute negetive(all laugh) cause he immediately spoke about what Trevenant told about him since Unova(all laugh) then aunty came in i called Mrs Ketchum as usual then she herself hugged me saying equal share(all laugh) so was ok later told of the Gengar's antics with her said he told you the good version at night via Conhoopa hallucinated me on the meanings of pictures while Mime reviewed the spans hence never existed(all laugh) so at morning i was dozed off and the brat created the runaway scene with his 35 year a day short psychophysical wife(all burst into laughter,Ash laughs a lot) we were in tears laughing and i said hence even you call him a brat(all laugh) aunty said even his mom-in-law would on the ceremony as well(all laugh) anyway,then finally the session ends and he was much relieved and said i never bothered to speak frankly to you or Daisy but spoke to Violet too many times so she knows me(all laugh) i understood whole world is judged according to Kommo-O(all laugh) cause he said i understood you were too sweet a person in core as your Cloyster i asked after seeing that he is too naive(all laugh) that do you know what to know if you’re hungry and no food is available(all burst into laughter) he said as interpreted by Chu was that he never faced Knowmon(all burst into laughter) which to him meant he never battled for food that is he is too close to his master as are others cause her food isn’t battle just the bunch(all burst into laughter) so i was so so sweet(all laugh) then Dase was judged by her Dewgong’s answer to him when he was asked do you understand the difference between a Seal and an ice beam(all burst into laughter) to which he was told via Chu that Seal isn’t a attack that is known or faced(all burst into laughter) this to him meant Dase isn’t serious enough in battling cause the basic difference in his Kommo-O gospel is that a ice-psychic that isn’t a psychic any level below the highest must understand that ice-beam is a hallucination to a Seal which is an attack cause one should learn from previous forms to make sure they understand how to manipulate the opponent in mind games thus ice-beam is a hallucination to a Seal attack means never think you’re not a Seal when you’re told to ice-beam cause your opponent will catch the idea that you’re at bay as to who you are now at present(all burst into laughter) so feed them that you’re all thus they will now be at bay as to whom they are facing who is hallucinating whom(all laugh) this means Dase is so sweet sweet(all laugh) and Mist isn’t gentle cause Gyarados told him that 2nd evolution phase is the the root of egotistic behaviours among few brats who are fed to infighting(all burst into laughter) so she could hallucinate herself by getting beaten by herself as she was not infighting being egotistical but was infighting in own mind(all laugh) exactly why she is spoiled now(all laugh) then Violet was judged by her concern over Mantine(all laugh) Brock was of course judged by his Steelix(all laugh) and then Tracey was judged by Marill’s heart-wrenching yearning for him(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) but he with his bunch has eyes on getting the sweetest pokemon of ours WOKEN(all laugh) but then my lion(all laugh) he was judged first that whenever he was asked about pokemons his outer Gary Oak demeanour gave away to the real Mr Oak(all laugh) and then again he was judged by Magmortgolem(all laugh) they were personally emotional professionaly mad(all laugh) now utter brats(all laugh) and finally Mist was his soulmate cause Pidgey evolved twice in a day for no reason to save himself(all laugh) so by the end i go out of room i didn’t know where i was so he made me a pokemon(all burst into laughter) then Mist came up and said saw that no wonder those namecalls at Unova always are too infatuated(all laugh) and was crying saying whole time this goes on and will never take me with him cause i’m too little and too sweet to understand he has to forget me to face legends and then the rest thus feeding me exactly to them exactly cause of this in my case(all laugh) so i consoled her as much as i could and was guided to the lab on Talonflame cause i should be carried around in my room as well cause i was to be bron with my Gili as well(all laugh) and i was invited for dinner there where i was treated of course as younger to Gili(all laugh) Dase wasn’t invited then though(all laugh) for which the day before he went off she was invited for lunch and was babysitted to utmost degree(all laugh) and on my way back on Talonflame i was assisted by Metagross(all laugh) one pest said the this brat on my back is naive so master brat forced me to fly happily which i can’t cause happiness is not in ideas if not in the flight exactly why all such are wrong(all burst into laughter) yeah like a hallucination of not serious fondling dream as a compensation to the real hallucination of ferrying substandard food from place to place rightly(all burst into laughter) so i realized these brats certainly are too happy thinking of standard girlfriend now(all burst into laughter) so unless for HUMAN interventions(all laugh) and hazards(all laugh) master brat surely will return so i was kinda assured and then Dase said she felt the same that Ketchum’s trouble was that what the humans will do humanly not with pokemons or pokemons themselves(all laugh) so then we both understood demonboy was only so cause pokemons didn’t help break-ups(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “just not that type(all burst into laughter)..but the crook had a great experience as well(all laugh) as did Violet but rather uneventful cause they both are sensei(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “to our utmost misfortune(all laugh)..so he informed me when Viol was out to Pewter only(all laugh) and then on last day evening came straight here on Charizard and Dragonite was there with him who were sent back as their discussion would’ve been interrupted othrewise on the right approach to date devolution by asking question on evolution to dilute the situation of intuition in mentation thus the approach could be to use the middle date to insinuate that phase provides more freedom(all burst into laughter) we didn’t know how to react as Ash was laughing so much saying this will i hear in those moments as well and we understood that indeed these brats have no age realated pokeissues(all laugh) and Ash wanted to spare the 5 who can breed still yet Charizard of all said just that youth(all laugh) but then sadly Gengleye were released(all laugh) and the pests fondled us a bit then went off said these two needs to know nothing cause if they have to think they will be disturbed as to which tickling method is to be reinvented for which hallucination of philosopher’s see saw at ontological bay(all burst into laughter) which he said was just to take human brats off their feet as they will be thoughtful of their greed as ontologically questioned(all laugh) and pokemons are no matter at all cause they will judge him while his bunch judges their masters and ask them these(all laugh) and then dinner was taken with us and some time spent in Mantine discussions and professional things(all laugh) actually he only had two hours from 21 to 23 within which dinner was one till 22:30 (all laugh) then within dinner itself we were invited to very short movie hall to depict our relation as appearing to Gengleye(all laugh) and then his relation to me and Viol the hallucinations were too real for comfort(all laugh) and he commentated on them(all laugh) thus we both understood indeed humans are real troubles everywhere reminding the word and tense(all laugh) then we were asked if we have any grievances against him or anyone at lab etc now that we decided to go there if it disturbed Viol’s work and so on(all laugh) and we said you just return within a month(all laugh) then he told us to be careful and all and Viol was again begged for mercy as i might be needed at places(all laugh) and he again told me if mom has any troubles just tell Dave he knows innumerable people who can take charges of the gym if McShin disturbs(all laugh) and infact Dave told i have to manage 4000 contacts now with pests at all levels of authority all over the world most at Unova and Kalos(all laugh) and then Viol was again requested to not get too emotional with all around and not to battle anyone with Mantine cause Mantine will win against most but she won’t in all cases(all laugh) and then he left on Gengleye of all brats(all laugh) went home at 00:00 woke till 7:30(all laugh) went to lab subtle body for 2.5 hours till 11 then left at 13:30 after breakfast(all laugh) then went to Unova Elite4 HQ at Cordosgrov in 2:15 hours at 15:45(all laugh) and here also i will say that our little sis was informed then cause she was trying to come here and then had to desist and all but i was fed to her and her little bro(all laugh) Drew said just quench their curiosity on legendary 5 minutes and simulations of all sorts of evolutions(all laugh)..later i had to battle with Toxicroak who said just leave the brat that was a Raichu upon me(all laugh) i was astonished myself as all my plans were so perfectly executed cause i was told not to disturb her with naive questions of physical or mental pain midmatch(all laugh)..then Mr Maple intervened and Saul,Junia and beautiful men gave important infos to get the brats off there(all laugh) then i finally reach the spot the few people there said Misty did all she could but it has taken a real toll upon her and she just broke down as soon as she saw me and had to console her but Chu was absolutely incensed to see me(all laugh) said from where are a chosen brat like you now imported with your naive bunch of leaglity(all burst into laughter) i’m fed substandard brats who doesn’t know how to behave on dates exactly like 2nd master who doesn’t have any stable signal while she sees master brat(all laugh) are you trying to learn her starving methods to appease your Mantine now she too is starving with that idiotic Mantine(all burst into laughter) so i dozed the brat off(all laugh) and then Misty said Goldy was telling her why she is so serious saw how we couldn’t be jovial with Tlplocus’(all laugh) and Jellicent,Kyogre and Gyarados of all revolted(all laugh) saying why they weren’t allowed to carry Chu to chase the brats cause Chu said he rather was regretting not having more fun for long while his choised comrades were having all fun(all laugh) and Bulbasaur and Muk were doing what they do but only showed the seriousness when their patience ran out as they realized human activities only could be the reason why their master brat wasn’t returning so turned on the whole world(all laugh)..but really demonboy and then so suddenly philsophy boy then again Unova boy(all laugh) and these antics of his bunch were too sudden for us to have a grip on anything(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “the evolition is just not that type(all laugh) anyway,then during that demonboy phase after Grandpa tells him about the grand daughter in law names,Grandpa said he just congratulated saying nice to know but immediately shifted talks and he never videocalled us...most of his friends didn’t know about Misty or wasn’t to a degree where they will talk about his personal life so were professional anyway with him,cause he doesn’t have any personal friends except very very numbered few(all laugh),then Tony and Braum were kept at utmost professional level as they were intruding(all laugh) Olivia and Falvia infact kept them grounded more(all laugh) and they ever told me too much bonhomie with ghosts and dragons against manuals(all laugh) Harris was and exception to them cause he knew Ashey-boy inside out and he always told me that it’s all because his mental state isn’t right and found a state where he is so connected to his pokemons they are like what they are but that has destroyed his personal life.he knew about Misty too,said just was so dissapointed to see this death in front of him and he with all the 3 rest being in Cerulian for many years knew all about how great Misty was in those years and Brenda too had similar opinions said this pest is at a level where it might’ve become impossible for him to become more HUMAN(all laugh)...then Kane was another who kept pace with him,he thought it was just his ego which has forced him to become unstable but Irene had real hard time(all laugh) well,Tony,Harris and Olivia all were personal closest friends to Misty but they managed and Olivia ever kept equidistance she believed ever that it’s either those two or bust and Irene was of that opinion too but she knew Mist since 5 and Kane knew Ash from 5 as well(all laugh) so was hard for her and Kane too(all laugh) then Hana ever told me all due to infatuation with battles(all laugh)..then Susana was atleast told about his personal life a bit cause she was out of profession and had contacts with the lab she told me always you will see same Mist flower will be the new one and the same Ashey-boy the other way around(all laugh)..then that Kalos incident happened and Grandpa and aunty were told in exact language what he said..aunty used to cry everyday almost since then saying how can a man with that view behave such with his family..it makes no sense at all...and then one day aunty said i said what i never did,that your dad would’ve rejected you as a son now that you’re behaving like this.this is the very last month before his return probably just before facing Lance...and he scoffed at her saying a very cruel thing as well said atleast i’ll have have my bunch with me even if his mom doesn’t want him anymore only cause he doesn’t return and he doesn’t as if he returns there all will jump upon him on his personal life and aunty since then did calm down a bit,said i’ve lost him he has no faith anymore on HUMANITY(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) just wants to be a pokemon..which was the case...Grandpa also said it shows that he has lost his faith upon human relations and just wants to become a pokemon and forget his human nature and thus his pokemons are getting that nature and becoming what they are,said,Ash will be remembered for eternity as long as the word pokemon exists but this death is going be telling all that you can’t follow him rather find your own path cause else you’ll be destroyed exactly like him...i asked Grandpa is a Team Rocket 2 happening still,he said this bunch is incomprehensible and thus no such business is meaningfull to them or Ash.they are just here to enjoy their time and leave and you know 102 of 107 couldn’t breed and thus more heightened powers but they reached that state perfectly knowing that they won’t breed anymore and yet doesn’t bother about it and in the very end days it just seemed they themselves are laughing at the world as none can get them and they are so happy to share their joy yet when needed so disciplined as Bulbasaur showed so every hour of a day and sadly though now they are stable in that total carefree atitude as their master brat has gone to a new level after returning(all laugh)...then finally he returned and asked me to clear off his path so that atleast Trace or our family wasn’t seen and thus he stayed for a 9 days and was with his bunch and both me and Trace saw him with his bunch and we saw the same Ash but way more jovial now as if he truely was a pokemon..and now he was such that all other pokemons were rushing to go to him even including Marill of all and he was so gentle to Marill Tracey said the same like he was was back in 17 years when he first saw Marill.. and yet Harris and all said professionally the same with the language being less abstract now understands his own absurdity much more these days but barely cares about pokemons all are just the different ways to get rid of the being to be the self according to his brats and thus his whatever he means by this(all laugh)..then he was doing those antics of course(all laugh)..anyhow accidentally one day while going away he accidentally met Lil and yes all his bunch were at my section and never went to Trace’s side exacpet for the first day,never stayed at home except for the first day and was here for 8 days only and in his farm where he went to jumping states(all laugh)...and when he met Lil they didn’t say anything of course but Lil told me he looked at me for only one moment and that was that for both of us the very first moment of accident and he looked with utmost disdain that i can’t express it is not that i’m his enemy or something it is as if saying you’re making a terrible mistake of some kind for no reason and thus wasting his time here having shown up in front of him and Lil said i went to his bunch afterwards and they fondled me to death and were so happy and then Bulbasaur actually vine roped Lil first as if to ask is there any problem and then as Lil talked about Gili,Bulbasaur don’t know what he understood but was so happy so patted him,this in the week of Cerulian break-in,when she suddenly had to look after only Bulbasaur for some time inside our area and Lil said this is impossible cause Bulbasaur realized i was not ill but most happy actually having Gili and thus he as if sensed another human being in me and was so happy too...and then we all know how he treated Misty may be 12 days later...that stuff what all physchics did with Sableye heading them and then Bulbasaur,we all knew was just about their absolute best to show for all those years Ash learnt about Misty’s health and mental emotions and all so minutely,as if they too realized it a lot and with Ash was now taking utmost care of her knowing full well what is what...and Ash was most brutal as obvious on Misty that day yet that was totally mental and thus her physical state was looked after so well...later we all saw even in that second battelion mood so gentle to all whoever was a bit weak as if Bulbasaur could sense it and now ghosts are fostering our children(all laugh)...and with all those then Lil said it just doesn’t make any sense and he probably has gone mad like all of his bunch has and then obviously we all had had our doubts...then just on the day he left for Cerulian to begin his process he looked most dangerous and he obviously by then had come to know about everything about everything and create that will stuff(all laugh)...just asked me to stand in front of him when he finally put Chu in the ball.Chu was moody as usual but even he i guess got very serious as he realized Ash that day cause he looked a real devil telling Chu unless he budges he’ll cut his tail off if he things he only needs one attack all the time or kill him by his own bunch...but then just after that seriousness Chu himself was pretty happy and as he does scratched Ash’s nose and then said like better be girlfriend cause we’re starving for ages(all laugh) and went inside the ball...and after he picked it up that first time in 4 years and burst into laughter and in a very jovial tone and went off saying quote,’Gary,Gary,Gary,Giti doesn’t know me neither does Zeru right?’...and i got him that he was tremendusly hurt by us inside and was irrepairably damaged and showed me that if Chu despite his stern warnings was so happy to follow his orders then what would Giratina do if the same was told to him cause he is pestering me for ages and i knew his temperament was nowhere near Chu but taming a Giratina like that takes way more effort than taming your starter even if a Pikachu so he definitely knew Ash as well as Chu for sure to my utmost misfortune(all laugh) and then Zeraora(all laugh) Zeraora isn’t polished much cause Giratina is a psudo-legendar y dragon ghost so too mistifying creature(all laugh) but Zeraora is a dreaded name throughout the world as well a electric psudeo-legend not found anywhere except Kalos and of course Unova of all places(all laugh) then Zeraora was tamed like Ash himself from wild and to pester me like the same in 9 months(all laugh) so all these Ash said and did just once more proved to me what he says and means isn’t the same,thus i realized that for all his efforts of 4 years he hasn’t forgotten Misty at all and thus now is killing himself finally and i knew due to their stubborness none would approach another to reconcile and it had to be that sudden accidental moment for Ash that he again found Misty via Lance just like Misty did in that Viridan Lake...then of course that Cerulian massacre happen(all laugh) and and then Violet tells us as soon as she saw Ash,the 16 year old girl is out screaming and fake-fighting with her my Ash(all laugh) and even after that so called humiliation as Violet went in was like he didn’t date me despite saying so(all laugh)...then Ash returns but now is very dejected and always with his pokemons and all,now everyone knows it so i asked just whether it was his own idea or someone told him to get the mess of the Gym away,he just scoffed it off saying with his name and all he is able to fondle anyone and won’t matter the protection will come but then suddenly in his normal tone of the little Ash i knew said,’Gary,regardless of Misty’s decision to meet me or not,i won’t be here a day more than my contract expires and neither will be my bunch except Mr Mime as she is doing now,mom won’t come with me i’ve failed in that pursuit...then told me about the farm a bit from Mr Eden’s business(all laugh)...then just said atleast see that mom is not physically killed by any mob or person,that’s all.’ ,well that was that mobbing incident and all but i felt bad that day said a bit compassionatly rather unknowingly,’Ash,don’t worry about aunty,that was a mistake from our part we just lost our mind but as long as i’m here it won’t happen again’.just faintly smiled at me for the first time in 4/5 years and went off..i was sure by then that he was thinking of suicide somehow and gave me the moral responsibility that atleast his mom isn’t killed due to his actions...this was just 5 or 6 days before Misty came here...but the day Misty came here he wasn’t here except the morning for a few hours but the whole night before that and i saw that in one and half days his whole disposition has changed to an utmost determined man who doesn’t care about absolutely anything at all and told me in a tone that is extremely dangerous as if he knows everything about everything and wants to rip everything apart but very calmly,’Mr. Oak,i’m sorry if i was emotional,you need not to be worried about my mom at all,i’ll make the arrangements myself,don’t worry and no i won’t hear anything more you have absolutely no responsibility on me or my family and never worry,i’m telling you cause that day and this day can’t be legally provisioned and thus both are agreed and terminated thus.please forget whatever i said that day in emotion.thank you.’...so i knew now his wrath and whole focus was fully on Misty and i was a bit scared but thought of his own quote itself that don’t bother...well he had that private area in the lab which had to be provisioned cause he said if his group homehow starts infighting now,he can’t allow anybody else in that area cause he can’t control them and that’s why such a vast and huge area was annexed to the Lab immediately via Lance who said Trevor told him to do so and then Professor Kukui himself told us and grandpa agreed and that area was provisioned which can hold double of his 107 buddies and thus the Lab itself was benefitted and that was totally financed by Ash as we later knew by forcing the whole world Elite4 and this was a year after the Undercover,that his reservation lab is to be honoured more than him and he won’t receive a penny more than his normal that he gets from his current professional position in his career and all else should be going to the Lab and in case that does’t happen,he’ll just tell everybody that the authorities themselves are no better than Team Rocket cause they now are trying to use their power to sabotage the undercover group and will not take any responsibility if now his bunch totally destroyes the whole 3 cities there cause many now won’t be used in battle cause they need rest and they don’t want that and thus will fight anyone and everyone in his absense and if he has to carry everyone with them,he won’t keep them inside pokeballs cause everyone knows he can’t and then similarity applies.Lance said that how Ash before passing a final statement of this nature ever asked him first and then only do it and never ignored his advice to him and Lance also said that Ash was just a great asset that he is so honest that now people has to work or his threats if comes true then it’ll go outside our profession as well but he also said that he understands Ash is really hurt personally and thus even a minor discrepancy is retorted against so harshly...anyway his private area was all his and unless someone was physically killed you really can’t say anything so i was thinking that he’ll torture her there so called him at night just said Misty wasn’t well don’t be too cruel just that which didn’t help us though(all laugh) but next day many of his bunch were around there though scattered thoughout and Crawdauntogator of all was so extremly solemn that i thought why are they needed in a date(all laugh) and i knew that we’ve made a mistake letting his bunch to stay here no matter what help they provided in research cause that 107 strong brigade as we now know can’t be tamed by 1070 swellened up legends may be and to my utmost surprize my own starter Blastoise,who was allowed there obviously,just scoffed at me saying today isn’t fun they are ready for a stand down and if i or anyone of us use him he’ll give his absolute best-this cause Blastoise doesn’t understand Ash’s mental states properly and interpreted that as battle..and then there was Magmortgolem(all laugh) who were just blood thristy professionally moling though in personal terms of dual type troubles(all laugh)..anyway,then i really understood that what Ash’s state is and just prayed that Misty doesn’t lose her head and get any of her pokemons out cause the whole 500 strong lab may be including our own will not listen if they try to attack them despite warnings and i recalled Misty with her Gyarados and the legendary status and just mentally prayed that Misty,don’t try to get him to battle may be he’ll kill the whole Cerulain City pokemons that day itself cause i sure knew no matter what Zeraora alone was a Lightenthunstrom best will much more intelligence(all laugh) and neither he nor Giratina noticed me that day for my relief from hell(all lugh)...then finally he insults us and show that we can’t do anything about him and i knew it that he’s right our own bunch may be believe in him more than us as Magmortgolem has backstabbed me(all laugh) so there’s no way to stop him that day and Lil was crying and all of course said like why Misty ever went out that day to the lake all cause of her,all her fault that this guy was allowed in the gym the day he confessed and so on which may be 9 days later was retold in a situation with doorlocks(all laugh) that Lil later said should’ve hired him to professionally abduct Misty(all laugh)...that’s demonboy for you...but then the demon was laughed off by the real Ashey-boy hours later to such a degree that we won’t forget it ever...and that demonboy still set his bunch upon both me and Mr Skechit(all laugh)..”
Daisy(smile) : “well i now about the depressed flower till those were found and she was in the middle of nowhere not knowing anything and then shut herself down, and i can say it anytime among family Mist,cause we all know simply in gross terms that that was tifle to what happened in last 17 months...Mist after that well(laugh) some beautiful men were uglying the gym(all laugh) since eternity of course but then all too beautiful ones were shown the way more beautiful no matter how beautiful they were,the Sinnoh Trophy with the name Ash Ketchum and that was it cause that picture were ever immotal with that comeback and as we said when he came back after that Mist so happily told she opened the Gym just for 2 days in last week and Ash was of course behind the curtains(all laugh)...getting a Pikachu was a fashion then(all laugh) which didn’t go down well for almost all(all laugh)..then of course during Unova all those happened and all but as soon as he broke-up and left all were just torturing her and us and so on and my attitude didn’t help none infact(all laugh) but my jackal would’ve fled the scene unless that quote helped the jackal to fox around as usual(all laugh) and i remembered exactly 8 times in 4 years she agreed to date and called off visiously before even getting ready for the occasions and twice i heard it was all namecalls and all and just said they don’t know what manhood is and better learn that first before even talking to their mothers again and the second the last of which she told me only by phone that she just rather cried only that day on such a occasion and said she can’t forget Ash at all simply cause none of them knows what manhood is except him and always used that word and that day because she cried suddenly as the beautiful men later told us by themselves said just lost it and went to challenge the great master and was taught such a lesson that they say he will remain their idol forever cause he has made them real beautiful men by showing that a man like that with all that is said about him,just in the end after all those congratulated them back with a little advice to not make foolish mistakes simply cause they surely understand that their bunches are also totally dependent upon them too who even interprets their mistakes as adoration and thus follows them.yes that made the men totally beg his pardon almost and later cried to us and all but then as usual,they don’t understand that the same personality is the flower whom only that man realizes fully and viseversa and thus tortures the flower to maximum and she shuts herself down finally...then we were seeing the slow death,Viol and Lil already moved out,i too then finally came here but sadly not alongside Lil cause ofcourse wickedness(all laugh)..as my man cunningly said(all laugh) that he of course first has to make a sketch(all burst into laughter) and thus was there a bit longer...by the way Ash,tell us again how you came to know about the marriage dates too beforehand(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “just my Mimey(all laugh)...was a deal(all burst into laughter)...i don’t know i mean so many times told mom that keep another pokemon with you to which she finally agreed to test one day my Gengar(all burst into laughter)...whom mom told to fetch a few cloths(all laugh)...which were fetched but put onto the oven(all laugh) to mom’s utter horror as both were just a little halucination(all burst into laughter)...and Mime ofcourse only was enjoying the game and was misbehaving(all laugh)...and then whole night the pest tickled her(all laugh) and suddeny appeared through the foods(all burst into laugh) and did all sorts of stuffs and as soon as mom was like crying or very dissapointed or too shocked calmed her nevers down with Mime to bribe her(all laugh) and then licked her to death(all laugh)...mom says after learning that he can’t breed like- too happy to have a family(all burst into laughter)...but atleast her phobia with darkness(all laugh) has been erased..but if it was Sableye(all burst into laughter)..would’ve been taught how to enjoy and ferry in darkness as well(all laugh)..heinous for aged people and family(all laugh)..though as you know she wants a Lugia(all burst into laughter)...that’ll be a serious trouble cause she’ll wake up in Cili’s home(all burst into laughter)...as you know these brats knows the whole world(all laugh)..and if i somehow cajole them to race with dragons(all laugh)..that means you can wake up anywhere in the world in the middle of the night(all laugh)..anyway,so my sweet Mist flower now procceds to contact me..she doesn’t ask anyone in lab about my whereabouts and calls mom(all laugh)..and accidentally calls her mom once too(all laugh)..i told her during that noon to which she too Mistly was like,’um..why aren’t we talking now inside your room(all laugh)’...by-the-way now i can’t even tell people my wife’s full name even in her absence to random stangers(all laugh)..told a kid who recognized me at the exit area as i was there and just before going out comes up and asks and all and he was the last challenger for that day but he is in his first journey 7th badge this was though and so doesn’t understand hall of fame gym and all that so well just knows two has to be visited and thus came here it’s his first asks if Mist is in hall of fame or not and you know with all things and this just re opened he asks so cause he picked up the Ketchum part only(all laugh)..and thus thinks that Mist is just my wife but i’m the real gym leader(all laugh) cause he wants to battle me(all laugh)..and this guy is from south-western Sinnoh(all laugh) here cause of it’s my first region(all laugh) was 8 when i won Sinnoh(all laugh)..went with mom and dad,4th row just on my left and parents were too happy that day thus all fan(all smile),tells me ‘um..sir..you had a cap(all laugh)’..thus doesn’t know much about Mist but Ms Misty Waterflower water show performer heard(all laugh) despite 5 year gap(all laugh)..anyway,Mist was a bit behind us around as you know last challenger out eternal one immediately in(all laugh)..so i just tell him..that no her full name is Misty Waterflower Ketchum and thus you may realize that she is in hall of fame and you can look up for her informations a real all time living legend you met today..so overjoyed then asks,’um..sir i heard about Misty Waterflower,she was a gym leader of big repute but she was also a water show..”(all laugh)...then i say yes,she is this one only(all laugh)..now only gym leader and that’s why too she is a true legend all round talent..so very happy and all and goes away...then as soon as we’re alone gym leader is fed to hells and my sweet Gyarados comes out(all laugh) and breaches the negetive circles(all laugh)...anyway(all laugh),says as she ever does,’hum..37 so now i’m Misty,hum..Misty..so sweet sweet name isn’t it..Misty..(all burst into laughter)...’,’Mist,please,he was a stranger...’,’shut up(all laugh)..then sits on my head(all laugh)...never say i’m Misty(all laugh)...’,’Mist,this name is so dear to me why would i..’..almost sobs now(all laugh)...’shut up(all laugh)..hum..you don’t cherish me as much now cause it’s been 21 years’..(all laugh)...this goes on and finally whins to me that by me the full name should’nt be used at all(all laugh)..and i was laughing when she was doing all these as i just kept going 21 years back(all laugh) same thing around me “attitude?”(all laugh)..right(all laugh),then in the challenger’s centre i was one day(all laugh) to uninsinuate(all laugh)...and i had to tell them like yeah the gym leader is my wife Mist(all laugh)...so she calls mom just a little talk and says if i was home or not and then suddenly appears at my home(all laugh)..mom of course heard about the hall of fame gym and all but didn’t realize much except a grave personality or something and later told me that first during phone she called mom as mom(all laugh)..then controlled herself with much difficulty(all laugh)...then mom said she has been here so many times(all laugh)..then mom was at the gym too many times as well(all laugh) and so she knew her too well and the viseversa for 17 years to not be mom and daughter(all laugh) so mom was again in a very dissapointing situation but was playing to the tunes of the deal(all laugh) cause she said before when i told her that Mist may come around said after some heated exchanges with me that,’either she’s my daughter-in-law or your beloved wife stays out of this place(all laugh)’..so i then was laughing saying to myself why is it so that i didn’t abduct her after undercover(all laugh) anyway then Mist came in and was looking younger than 5(all laugh)..first comes and immediately wants to go to my room(all laugh) cause that’s where she stayed when she was there(all laugh) and whenever i took her to the lab to show her my bunch after Frontier she went there same(all laugh) and i was at ghostly room(all laugh) but then during Sinnoh my bunch were incensed and she didn’t want to come or let me come(all laugh)...and mom of course was counseled before not to allow her to have her ways(all laugh),so she hesitates then Mist gets very upset and then of course demands to know about my girlfriend(all burst into laughter),then as i fix our date(all laugh) communicated through my 2 beautiful little lackies then office holders at Sinnoh ELITE4 for just 2 months(all laugh)...and a bit about them as i yet haven’t spoken about my dear bro and lillte sis-in-law in here the 1002nd time(all laugh)..my bro is a certain Mr David Duncan(all laugh),Hall of Fame from home(all laugh)...really you know his and my positions in the great hall of fame(all laugh) and the remodelled once ever 3 Cities Cup(all laugh)..that’s a damn hard challenge(all laugh) and he can do everything there via lackies from home(all laugh) same stuff as me home made lunch(all laugh) the time is one hour before me(all laugh) same 9-5 on his Talonflame(all laugh) one and half hour lunch half less than me(all laugh) works by observing(all laugh) and almost got the license to battle as Kanto Hall of Famer cause after all it’s Jasu and McShin(all laugh)..Jasu(all laugh)..that man and this name is something(all laugh)..Dave gets the homemade lunch but atleast not tiffin....ok(all laugh),fine(all smile,Ash quickly hugs Misty very firmly smiling at her,Misty smiles at Ash and then both return to same pose)...well lunch is for 7 people as suppliment but only my tiffin(all laugh)...right(all laugh),so Dave is 6 leagues,6-1..but he’s a default quadruple Z-double hall of famer,(all laugh)..now too Z(all laugh) exactly born in the next month to me(all laugh) and started the same(all laugh) from Celestic Town most historical place at Sinnoh(all laugh) and thus he is an encyclopedia on everything Sinnoh(all laugh) but just the culture(all laugh) then starter Pichu(all smile and .) so you understand how good he is that handled his Pika and Pika evolved into the great Raichu(all laugh)...first region Sinnoh-win,second Hoenn-win,Third Sinnoh Frontier-win,4th Johto-win,5th Orange-couldn’t win,6th- Kalos of all places win(all laugh) finally 7th Unova of all places couldn’t win by luck but my sweet little bro more than has that title as well then Kanto-absolutely won and faced my Mist as well(all laugh) and then infact faced me in Unova at first round(all laugh) and he actually was rather upset in first round(all laugh) and that i could get that but then just had a chat and all he believed in all the newses after he lost(all laugh)..cause you know him how passionate,could’nt believe i haven’t invented some new illegal elements(all laugh) and then Oak Lab was getting the flack for hosting a too incuisitive duo(all laugh) out of which only one is a human(all laugh) and their mates were of course Tyrangaleoveltal(all laugh)..in pursuit of happiness(all laugh)..those 3 sre something and then they have Lycanroc(all laugh)..really Tyranitar never has anyone to sypathize with him(all laugh)..thus all 4 in pursuit of happiness(all laugh)..Lycanroc told Fortifogtarmisgius are you alright(all laugh) he was taken aback as to what does it mean then Lycy says cause it’s right to not be bothered about feelings that has no reason to arise unless the right is seen as wrong as you see the whole world such hence are wrong to yourself despite understanding i don’t want to attack at all so you’re in this self created unhappiness a chain a shackle a complex structure to VEIL(all burst into laughter) the right as it is from the wrong as any thoughts of the right will make it to be more right thus the next right suppresses the previous one leading to the pursuit of mistakes are you happy(all burst into laughter) then legend realized this brat is in pursuit of happiness which unless he gets in he will be lectured to death(all laugh)..anyway,Dave was already enough when met me to be ready for hall of fame(all laugh) and i and he ever have heard about each other always in opposite directions(all laugh) and then had to be Unova(all laugh) i told him that you would’ve beaten me left and right in Hoenn atleast says um would it have mattered had you not won a single league(all laugh) i said definitely battle starvation is the reason(all laugh) says no way i battled as much but this is ridiculus(all laugh) so his Raichu was greeted first day by none other than Zeraora(all laugh)..’um..i see new import(all laugh) what’s the chosen name(all burst into laughter)’ so riles Raichu up who scoffs at him to which the reply is,’no you look like a pokemon but are you(all laugh)’ Raichu fled the scene to get Rotomed(all laugh),’i see new form(all laugh)..see what is thy actual form(all laugh)’ flees the scene again to finally fall in the dark stream leading to happiness(all burst into laughter) ‘i see too jovial(all laugh),why are you so my dear,have you had enough food(all burst into laughter)’ again somehow Raichu flees the scene to sadly get Zekrom(all burst into laughter) now think of that size to Raichu(all laugh) says,’today so much heat,i feel too weak,please dear don’t you like me(all burst into laughter)’ Raichu immediately tries to flee but is Zekromed again,’but..but..i cherish you so much(all burst into laughter)’ that was enough for Raichu to almost cry when comes the great lord(all laugh),see you must’ve had some issues with negotiation(all laugh) then lectures him Raichu now realizes that this is pokemental asylum(all laugh) so offers the Lord of all to play(all laugh) lord was waiting for this moment to chide frivolity(all laugh) then Raichu is dissapointed and resorts to the final option which is sadly Luxray(all burst into laughter) goes to him gravely says how is ice beam produced(all laugh) Raichu thinks that may be this guy just battle starved(all laugh),says like in this tone,’electric,thunderbolt at most what thunder chair(all laugh)..cries his head off I WANT TO WATERGUN(all laugh)...’ Raichu goes to the ground rock section where Donphan was about to jump upon him(all laugh) but before that comes the great Heracross(all laugh),’um..would you be my 4th illegal beau’s 3rd legal beau’s illegal beau 6th(all burst into laughter)’ Raichu now cried(all laugh) then all fondle him to death and all so he realizes that these guys are like that no hope(all laugh) finally they send him to Bulbasaur who says life is hard(all laugh)..Dave told me these saying like bro i’ve had my career but these brats(all laugh) was it a special dish(all burst into laughter) i said ask Mr crook(all laugh) later Dave asked my sis you’ve known bro for ages(all laugh) really did he ever seriously battle(all laugh) sis said just ask him why Gyaradoses are too sweet(all laugh)...so Dave’s story you know no siblings mom and dad both out of profession but both were big fans then the great rocket was there and that accident and all but yeah he had the financial security through his own and his uncles and we all know Mr Eden and Mrs Janette and Lucian and family as well but all were out of profession so the passion really got him through since 16 and then only when time came both were 5 time champs i had no reason to go there his more than plausible and then we met there and all then there itself got the missing Z(all smile) first time after being formally introduced to Mist,Dave just said you’ve had her since day one but had i have had to wait for 15 so that’s why you’re nature is so Mistyfied(all laugh) and Zara then was most busiest(all laugh) said ‘um..but bro why hasn’t you seen even one show(all burst into laughter) said i prefer private cosmetics(all laugh)..then both laughed saying yeah surely a mermaid is a girl(all laugh) and then you saw my this lackey’s invisible Sinnoh-beau(all laugh),a real dreaded Gengress(all burst into laughter) in courts as you know now..well i had very good connections with Dave as you know since our undercover days and knew how great a man he is and he ever realized me and thus kept the right balance then of course he wins Kanto gets the job immediately and already married and all then of course Zara herself knew me just as her bro as well and it was just 1 day into his job and both he and Zara begs me to make them lackies(all laugh)...i tell them to calm down don’t jeopardise yourself they as you know had bad experience and said that no we can come she’s alright and i’m Kanto champ myself and it’s only 1 day here(all laugh) so just that and still you know so happy to be here now despite all that those m.. dragged them through and also Trevor was the only reason he was in Sinnoh but then he of all did what he did and just has stayed..by-the-way he today confided,’um..bro,isn’t it a bit too suspicious that even baby Lugias are so happy’(all burst into laughter)...anyway,i finally tell him cause you know in undercover you have to share your secrests like that in certain situations in the last days and he had none(all laugh) so i did tell him about Mist but said that we just broke-up and i though have come over that but she was just too devoted to me for 13/15 years and he did know everything about my travel details expect the travel companions as the custom...then finally i said that Mist was my first travel companion and we were in relationship ever she was too fond of me since that first day and only in last around two years due to the newses was just deflated and he very well knew who Mist was professionally and that show too and realized it..i just told him that i don’t know if she is trying so hard to reconcile now and i can’t again confirm her my position which is still a big no and that’s just pains me a bit cause after all a friend and very first travel companion and all and you know with his intelligence he realized perfectly that whatever i was saying only meant that i was as much devoted to her and still is though just never sure like her and might have thought of moving away for professional reasons and her star status cause he knew more than anyone how i behaved in those compromising situations which he equally shared with me and knew that may be that star status Mist had then was the trouble for me and my name and allegations for her cause she wanted expected freedom herself but never allowed me any so a huge misunderstanding and jealousy from both of us and then ego and thus ultimately broke-up..but i just told him to atleast once check it with my Lab and if they tell her no she was happy and forgotten me...fine(all laugh),too Gyaradosey(all laugh)..right(all laugh),cause Professor Oak he knew and Professor would definitely know it via our beloved jackal first thing after waking up(all laugh)...but all these are what i thought i said(all laugh) actually may be i said ‘Ah!my Mist so sweetie’(all laugh) and told him to contect her directly(all laugh) so he went to Cerulian after that and by then he was my second cousin and 6/7 months later dear sweet little bro(all laugh)...May ever says that if Dave was there at Hoenn it would’ve been fun with his and my nature matching and our sis would’ve become reddened quickly(all laugh)..but now even break-up and anywhere FULL NAME STRICTLY PROHIBITED (all laugh)...will forget it soon unless Gary manes his tricks again(all burst into laughter) and thus later of course had a great match with Mist and i was too emotional about it(all laugh) then i finally said i’ll haunt Cerulian down and have about a week only(all laugh)...then the team is formed and i told them to keep me informed and i’m going to Kalos,where my little Gili will go for a certain kind of dengerous Lugia(all burst into laughter)...how’s that lioness(all laugh)..?.”
Lillie(laugh) : “will paw your marriage if denger(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “impersonally(all laugh)..as mom the thoughts that you have now about her what is this thought is a friend actually(all burst into laughter)..anyway,so i was in Kalos,land there one day,Persy calls the code language is like this,’hypostitas-ephronunus-cytonint,skyblatel-tycot-hurantof-(spell)DATE(all burst into laughter)’,reply is,’..Muk’s type specified...(all laugh)..cause you have to tell them what you’re going to use unless you too will be illegal(all laugh)...SWEETIE(all laugh)..means date confirmed(all laugh)..if caller is woman(all laugh)...then FISHED(all burst into laughter),yeah,that one(all laugh)..’ ..so(all laugh) the date takes 18/19 days and all(all laugh)..in the meantime i’m doing everything possible and it takes ages to complete all...and finally i’m set,now Dave was in charge,threatened all beautiful men to death(all laugh) via his own Raichu(all laugh).. who himself is extremely too much dangerous(all laugh)..and as you know Dave knows my mom as well as he had to guide Chu-bro in as does Jack who also is just such a great friend as a mole against Jasu(all laugh)...then Simon threatened Sarah(all laugh)..he tells me,’yes,’mam,have you heard the name of Ash Ketchum?he is in Elite4 now just my junior and very concerned about this gym(all burst into laughter)...which is reciprocated by me in double(all burst into laughter)...so ‘mam we want through check-up without one word being said to any leaders(all laugh),else you realize(all laugh)...yes,he threatened the permanent red tape stuff cause Gyarados is dangerous for public health if her master isn’t alright(all laugh)...’,then Sarah realizes it’s about absolutely nothing but definitely everything about the certain particular Mist flower(all laugh)...so she just follws suit and gives that private section entrance registry for 4 long years(all burst into laughter)...then of course she is asked about what she knows she cried to Simon saying that i was the reason for all this and now he wants to take revenge on all and she really did break down and Simon just told her that her apprenhension is totally wrong and told that i was just trying to figure out if someone else is the reason for all this mess then i won’t help cause that’ll be meaningless otherwise i’ll use my sentiments to get her out of depression and all and all this is because of Mist’s name and activities and she’ll not allow me inside the gym and all that and she instantly realized that i was just desperate to again propose her(all laugh) which my whole group instantly realized(all laugh)..cause i was actually unknowingly telling them ‘my Mist’ all the time and my language of course(all laugh)..later they ask me,’um..are you sure you don’t want to date her(all laugh)?’...and i told them do what i say(all laugh),i have to be more assured and Kalos was a trick to all showing i may have to get rid of someone(all laugh and .)...and i must not disturb anyone if she has a realtion and the only way to know is to search all those who are not realtions(all burst into laughter)... and then i told you beautiful men were sampled according to their beauty(all laugh)..they enter utter my name,which of course means(all laugh)..please Sir,i’ve a livelihood(all burst into laughter)..so if the order of the empress wasn’t enough now the world dreaded playboy was haunting for their heads via Kanto Elite4 deputy head(all laugh)..and had the whole Sinnoh Elite4 licking his boots(all laugh)..plus had Kalos of all riches(all laugh)..but more importantly himself had 15 dragons(all laugh) and innumerable ghosts(all laugh)..that’s enough for one life(all laugh)...Lance just gave them full freedom and Simon too happy still are says 103 legends too much and yet i went and that’s why they did what they did but strictly told me to never go again no matter which namecall turns up cause no namecall can get full swellen rarest 103 unless the authority was namecalled and they said 103 atleast know not to come around for an appointment thus the other 10300 will follow suit and you can sleep for the rest of your life cause eventually the money will be more than enough(all smile)..well Lance and Simon joked that without any thought of any outsider just make 30 to 60 in years(all laugh) ..only they among very few at their level uttered this word but Persy with his beau is trying to Ho up(all laugh)..Lance ever gave me freedom saying he personally knew the greatest boss and that’s enough for one life and thus i got what i got and he realized my antics was all because of my sepration and saw first hand my behaviour with half dumped female brats(all laugh)...so anyway,Sarah sarahs up(all laugh),cause she knew everything about our realtionship and Brauchy man(all laugh) too followed suit,i went up to Cerulian,during that public thing not much but then personally both told that any help and i just said that it’s alright but i’m abducting her(all burst into laughter)...i said it’s alright i’ve myself realized that for a long time now she is definitely single and that she can never be due to her nature and hence all trouble...they tell me no it’s always you and can’t be anyone else for her she just can’t stand the presence of anyone except you personally..i just said well i’ll see about that cause we both have to talk a lot before we even can think of anything else...anyway night falls(all laugh)..but a bit later first finish with my lackies so you are everyday seeing how true lackies they are(all laugh)..by the way then i misbehaving with you(all laugh) but those two are like Gengar(all laugh)..as soon as they were given the signal,next day poor Gary reaches somehow at around 7:00 and they tickle him to death(all laugh) and still doing(all laugh)...by-the-way i knew Gary will be alone and not foxed(all laugh),cause the fox along with the days(all laugh)...weren’t really here(all burst into laughter)...cause it was 20 years(all laugh)...what was the reminiscences of madam of days(all laugh),Mr jackal(all laugh)
Tracey(laugh) : “OH SO GLORIOUS(all laugh)...no really i just can never forget it even in next life(all laugh)...Ash,please another(all burst into laughter)...but yeah this time the days and the baby sis abducted by her MistyBoy(all laugh)
Daisy(laugh) : “well all i can say is that wickedness would increase(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “my Ketchumed-flower(all laugh and .)..is not wanting to talk today cause she’s too sweetened today(all .,and smirk at Misty saying things,Misty lightly reciproctaes and kepps hugging Ash very firmly smiling at him,Ash smiles at Misty and continues to tender her)...so i’ll do that,well,actually since the show except the physical necessities 0 feet and any words asked=divorce(all laugh)...well Trace the glorious part will be a bit hard for now so i’m just leaving it for later cause i’ve got so much to say but Daisy i think you should if you want can do away with your memories of that phase cause my parts are going tobe funny..”
Daisy(smile) : “it’s being done now,Sarah cried to me so many times that Ash was the reason and all and then finally Ash says that,i didn’t tell Trace cause he already was extremely busy with urgent jobs and all and i was happy that Mist is no more depressed but that not made no sense to us and all and we all said don’t meet him but you know you can’t stop her if she decides unless forcefully which again we couldn’t do and thus i was just almost dying that day seeing the whole 19 years in front of me and it really was demonic for sure...but again no matter what that night is that night(all smile)...”
Ash(laugh) : “well jackals don’t sleep at night that i was proved again(all laugh)...so by the way,my home was summoned as i said cause i may stay at my home(all laugh)...mom calls me too overjoyed(all laugh),’honey,is my daughter coming back’,’mom,just a random stranger no more’,’honey,why are you..’,’mom please,you know i haven’t patched up or anything or want to just told her if she wants she can meet me’...this means marriage to mom(all laugh)...’hmm,couldn’t give the ring 4 years ago(all burst into laughter)?’..and you know what mental state i was in then..’mom don’t disturb her is she comes around the home and don’t go overboard,she knows us all but don’t get emotional’...mom’s trouble you know she doesn’t understand what actually is a date(all laugh) cause dad took 3 months to marry a random stanger that she was(all laugh)...now gives that knowledge...’Ash,don’t cut off cause those idiots of yours doens’t know excpet attacking(all laugh) i’ve got things to say’,’mom,can’t you just tell her to behave properly and not try to use the past to get an upper hand on us?’..this gets her to become very grave...’Ash,listen your dad and i recognized our relation in 7 days and we barely talked more than an hour and half in whole all because of the supreme happiness we felt in each others company and presence almost as soon as we met,and hence your name(all laugh)...i was thinking yeah great,would you let me be that now(all laugh)...and i say,’mom,please you and dad and this garbage(all laugh)...’...so sweet garbage(all laugh)...actually she is smiling so sweetly cause that is cosmetics(all laugh)..anyway then,’Ash SHUT UP!..what kind of language is this(all laugh)..no matter what Misty was you first travel companion and you know most well what i’m talking about(all laugh) and she STILL WANTS YOU SO MADLY(all laugh)..hence is coming only(all laugh) and let me finish or i’ll  tell her you want to marry her(all burst into laughter)...’,a deal(all burst into laughter)...so i say ok i’ll burgain too if that makes her to cut off(all laugh),’mom,look she might already have had many boyfriends..’,’ASH!don’t think that everybody will go around like you faking dates(all burst into laughter)...i sure know you’ve no idea how to properly talk with girls(all laugh)...’,’alright alright calm down say what you’re saying’,’right,i was saying that your dad din’t take more than 3 months to decide and settle down and yes you would say he was not journeying around but you know he had much more difficulties,you have absolutely none of those but what you dad wouldn’t ever had allowed you to have is what you have and hence your troubles which are those dark types(all laugh),will Gengar ever tell any girl to marry you(all burst into laughter)..or will his comrade at arms Sableye ever advise you to date this girl this girl(all laugh uncontrollably,tears)..get rid of those idiots and Misty wants to come here means she only ever has you in her mind and i’ve spent more time with her after your great declaration(all laugh) than you have(all laugh)..i know how much she cherished you and still more than does..you’ve hurt her the most beyond measures and still she wants to be here cause you went to her gym and yet i hear created some troubles with those dark types(all burst into laughter)...Misty just wants you to give her the ring for 16 years(all laugh)..yeah now someone like you will say why she doesn’t(all uncontrollably laugh)....if she knew your wherabouts she would’ve(all laugh)...wherever you are when you go to meet her propose her(all laugh)..and remember that she won’t propose you(all burst into laughter)...and first get rid of those two and then only go(all laugh) they won’t provide you lines(all burst into laughter)’...man if only mom knew the vulture-killer(all burst into laughter)...anyway i say,’yeah i understand i’ll see but don’t get too emotional cause neither you nor me actually know her side..’,’i know her sisters well(all laugh)...no doesn’t matter what they said i would’ve been way worse may be and still you know they have just been indifferent and nothing else and the few time had to talk were very polite and i understand their hurt only because you’re my son i can’t forsake you..and they’ll run back to me and you as soon as you’re giving the ring...anyway,you’re not getting a better girl than Misty in any lives remember that and that’s all,’mom wait,don’t cut off,Daisy and Lillie,what about them i only heard from professor Oak and only now have come to know that Daisy too is expecting her future but nothing else do i know,when did they get married and all please tell me i need to know’...by the way Gary,i always wondered that out of all labs only 20 labs are there in the world out of 201 that provides starters for only direct family members or dependecies or naive-jackals(all burst into laughter) if it can be shown properly but sadly to Kanto(all laugh) by virtue of which i’m one from here and in 2 generations only too(all laugh) cause mom said 45 is 22 more than 23(all laugh)..and don’t worry none of any of my nephews and nieces will get starters from any labs dragons are ordered to be delivered at 10 thus Cili is threatened(all laugh) and will come Bagon and Dratini for Blosie and Jas(all laugh),Noibat for Gili only(all laugh),Deino for Alice and Jangomo-O for Alissa due to the name pronounciation expressional meaning(all laugh) Tyrunt or double delight for great professional(all laugh),Axeu for Max and Mia in double,Gible will go to my bro and sis-in-law in double if so and Goomy double quadruple if so to the sensei double(all laugh)..but why is it so Gary about the special lab type that Professor ever thought of this even in the beginning which was pretty hard and never budging from that is it the location only?”
Gary(smile) : “yeah i guess it is but grandpa actually wants pokemons to be free and pure so that actually what happens to them is known and not what their trainers imprint upon them cause grandpa ever said that it’s just about they themselves not much about the trainers cause their certain faculties help them to gauge and be faithful to trainers so i guess that but again one Ashey-boy is enough(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “imagine 8000 Crawdauntogator(all laugh)...then Lugia(all laugh)..but out of 30 gyms(all laugh) only a certain gym leader isn’t happy(all laugh)..right(all laugh)..so anyway mom say as i ask about my sister-in-laws,’hm..didn’t even have the minimum curtsey to talk to Gary about his and Lillie’s future which you already know?’,’mom,look no matter what Brock and the 3 Waterflower sisters will ever remain my guides in my professonal life cause they were the only 2 Gyms where i wasn’t good enough to get the badge and yet they showed their compassion by giving it cause they thought i could progress in this profession.I’ve already made provisions for Pewter City Gym as much as i thought would be possible but now this mess called Cerulian(all laugh)..’,’Ash,stop there.first that mess was due to you and you only(all laugh) and you again worsened it last week(all laugh).secondly,that will be your home soon(all burst into laughter) and thirdly and most importantly,show some respect for gyms without whom you would’nt have become what you have and you yourself said it but just because of your own fault there is a trouble there don’t lose that respect.you want to know the marriage dates?’,’yeah’..so tells me more way than necessary(all laugh)...finally says,’finally,i know Mist wants you and yes call her in that name(all laugh) when she meets you..she yearns for you still and don’t hurt her and lastly,if you try to get someone else,i’ll see whether she is exactly Mist or not(all burst into laughter).’,’mom,wait,so the whole world now thinks that a certain Ms Waterflower(all laugh) is hellbent to date me of all who dumped her 4 years back without any contact?’,’dumped?(all laugh)...Ash,mind you language(all laugh) and you created the trouble she didn’t break-up(all laugh)...by now i was rather enjoying this(all laugh)...you got involved in things and then started to behave like you did in public places and that definitely has to do with those dragon types(all burst into laughter)..just pick up the pieces,give her the ring and settle down WITHOUT YOUR GHOSTS INSIDE YOUR PERSONAL ROOM(all laugh)..’,’mom i went to her with the ring you know that.’,’yeah,but then went into battling(all laugh)..just shut up and let me finish...either Mist is my daughter-in-law or your DEAR wife stay outside of this place(all laugh)..good bye..’...this was so funny really(all laugh)...anyway then Dave of course was all ready at the farm and all that,said all things ok,i tell them about my sisters and all then finally call comes in,Mr. Drew Blackmore(all laugh)..i fell from the sky really cause just what i said and then Mr Maple and Mrs. Maple didn’t say one word about anything and Mrs Maple just the formal coutrsey and Mr Maple too just the formality but they really wasn’t upset with me as it seemed later Drew said all they thought was what May thought was just too much ego and power has disturbed my mental balance and as you know and swee that they really are my own family it was just that spoilt kid stuff for them and thus i was better be kept away from when i myself was wanting that and thus May did keep contact with Mist though became very infrequent cause Mist wasn’t right and May did realize that and just kept the contact very brief and didn’t really do much cause all their relationship was centred around me only and that was it.anyway,that Kalos brat VIA Professor Oak told me she has spoken with Mist and apologized and all,i said yeah good riddance(all laugh)...but after that she never contacted Professor Oak again cause you know she was out for Unovan Cilans(all laugh) and professor too was unhealthy and that brat was never interested anyway just that one year torture was too huge for any brat thus the contact.so anyway,Mr Drew Blackmore calls after 1 year or so,’um..hellow Mr Ketchum,...gives his identity with callingname(all laugh)..,may i have a few words with you if you’re free and can spare the time?’..i was incensed(all laugh) cause i surely knew that this rose is too shrewd a vomit cleaner(all laugh) to not know Cerulain break-in cause he knew only too much too well about the contest there being one of the founders and whenever around every time met with Mist formally if she wanted to with or without May and might’ve met 10 times in 2 years and that break-in created a mass difficulty in our whole profession at Cerulian cause Kanto being Knato even the Conference Congress wants to defame me who has only one shared ribbon(all laugh)...so i knew that this rose has volunteered to be the lackey(all laugh) citing different region unbias(all laugh) so that he can gauge and then report too roseyly(all laugh) which is what he exactly did(all laugh) via 500 phones may be(all laugh)...so i say and actually my wrath from the outside world was much mitigated by then cause my only target was Mist and the full wrath was on you cause finally i deleted the outside and focused on the very root so it was alright plus mom’s call made me laugh so much in my mind(all laugh)..the only thing i wanted to know was if she ever had been to one mental hangout(all laugh)..cause i knew certainly there were no physical hangout as Safforn tour confirmed that those are only used after very long depression like 3/4 years otherwise the body itself will reject them and i saw her few diaries and with all my lackies everywhere i knew that Cerulian City wasn’t the place atleast..during my stay here in those 8 days went there one day and myself only met one beautiful sample except the great Frank Cutcher(all laugh),who was such a pet(all laugh) and this sample,who was the propagator and then communicator and a defector from the very gym as you know and he was none other than our beloved Victor Morris(all laugh) the 2nd sweet son of Brauch Morris and Sarah Keith Morris,who is indespensible(all laugh) student of Sableye in become Gengar classes(all burst into laughter)..all must tickle Gengar back for the pest to get most happy and thus kill them out of laughter(all laugh) and most dangerously all must suddenly dissappear(all laugh) in halucinations where its show how Gengar VIA Sableye is bestowing the compassion on the world Dark Night Constant Safforn Forest Version(all laughter)..he said like,’hmm...i just said that cause they were so unhappy hence an arranged situation and thus looking up cause you must understand customs and the their positions and my position too also emotionally,so volunteering was to me only method(all laugh)’,’Victor,what exactly was your trouble?(all laugh)’ then goes all about it and i then said that how far is your reach(all laugh) before he could say anything of course our referee double comes out(all laugh)..sobs(all laugh)...’hum..you..you want to take our jobs(all burst into laughter)..you’re accusing us all despite knowing everything and we ever thought you were infatuated(all laugh)..why did you never gave Misty ‘mam a flower boquet(all burst into laughter)..goes on...’,’Mrs Hana Halmsley Morris,sister of Mr Kane Halmsley(all laugh) Water Pokemon specialist breeder on open ocean(all laugh)..calm down please..now this name mention calms both down
how do you know SO MANY THINGS HERE THOUGH YOU’RE MARRIED ONLY FOR 3 YEARS(all burst into laughter)..’..this gets both to become absolutely angry(all laugh)..before both can eat me up,’i see reffering takes 6 years before 3(all burst into laughter)’...then why this was a plan of me was to get the two brats to SHOW the BOND(all burst into laughter)...now both confess their longing for their soulmate(all laugh)..then Hana says in this tone,’atleast my Vickie gave me flower boquets whenever i came here(all burst into laughter)...’ and Vickie says in this tone,’Ash,please,stop this and marry Misty ‘mam today(all laugh)’..’today itself will require a bit of riches(all laugh)..see Mr and Mrs Moriss,i can FEEL(all laugh) that there’s a bit more in salary that’s given to referees these days(all burst into laughter)..especially if their husbands are out of reach for 14 days a month(all burst into laughter)..so may i help your positions(all burst into laughter)..’,Victor sighs and shakes his head but Hana is so dejected,sobs,’hum..you..i always knew you’re after us and our jobs(all laugh)..first you told everything to bro(All laugh)..and now you want our jobs...I’LL COMPLAIN TO ALL OTHER ELITE4s(all laugh)...’ then Vickie thinks he calms her down a bit,’Hana please just joking,whole world Elite4 has to budge to him(all laugh)..’..sweet sweet Vickie boy(all laugh)..Hana cries even more,’you..you..Vickie why is this devil after us(all laugh)...’,still not Daisyl though(all burst into laughter)..,’Hana,please,stop this,Elite4 Head can’t fire special referees from Referring Association(all burst into laughter) and the gym is a hall of fame not anyone can referee there and i can’t do anything in internal matters either,please just let us have a talk,send my best wishes to Kane and family,please calm down’,then she finally doubls down(all laugh) and you know i can’t contact Irene of all people(all laugh) cause that’s against the ethics of honesty in moral honesty of ethics in honesty which is a question of ethics not only(all laugh) so now Hana sis says,’yeah,bro and sis also i guess has benn..(all laugh)..’,i said please Hana stop these suspicion games(all laugh) you know well your bro and sis none will get involved by any means anyway and looking at the condition here i don’t think even they..(all laugh)’,’my bro and sis are way better in handling PERSONAL ISSUES UNLIKE YOUR GHOSTS(all burst into laughter) who are around now(all laugh)’,Rayquaza blinks(all burst into laughter) sourrounding me(all burst into laughter),so Vickie sighs(all laugh) and Hana says,’and let us see the full gang led by a psudo-legendary dragon named Rayquaza IN A CIVIL ROOM SURROUNDING YOU(all burst into laughter) so right in front of them blinks Mismagius(all burst into laughter)..now Vickie says,’Ash please send these little kids to mommy(all burst into laughter)’ Hana says,’no Vickie these are the culprits you know(all burst into laughter) bro says was so sweet at school and Misty mam you know(all laugh) these pests have taken him away from HUMANS(all burst into laughter)’..well cause they could limitlessly practise upon humans(all laugh)...anyway Vickie sighs again(all laugh) then Hana says,’yeah sis is STILL in contact with Misty ‘mam who is in serious mental troubles i tell you BECAUSE OF YOU ENTIRELY(all laugh) battles alright but won’t be for long her bunch isn’t very happy either she is only wating for you don’t waste your time go to the gym and straight to the reservation(all laugh)...’, then goes off...now Victor is asked,’see Mr Morris(all laugh),public display of closure(all burst into laughter) no matter the number and familiarity of the MOB of even pokemons(all uncontrollably laugh)..like the Cloyster and Seaking with Blastoise(all laugh)..the Caserin and the Luverine(all laugh) though they never saw the PROPER moments(all laugh) too cunning(all laugh)..and yeah,right Swampets are good closure for Mantines(all laugh)..anyway,public display of closure is not suitable for a man who must remain CALM and grave if 2 ghosts tickle him whole day and compel him to reciprocate(all burst into laughter)’..just shakes his head cause he knows my reservation days of PRIVACY(all laugh) and finally calmed down a bit so to rouse him up(all laugh) first Rayquaza again blinks now sourrounding him(all brust into laughter) then Mismagius sits on my shoulder visible(all brust into laughter) and then(laugh,all laugh) i ask him that how far is Hana’s reach(all burst into laughter)...now the great lecture starts,’Ash,what do you think of us,huh?!?...we have been here for so long and you know why we are here,all your rage suddenly is upon us because we can referee in finals and other places and mom and dad knows everything here and everyone in good positions Cerulian so we will haunt around to arrange(all laugh)..and Kane you know extremely well never wanted Hana to involve in your personal matters and then also that of Misty ‘mam’s and you know her too well...and us too(all laugh)..and your great confusion whether Irene would do the dirty work behind your friend you yourself know the answer better than me(all laugh) it was them who told me in um..signals(all burst into laughter)..’,’i see Mr Morris(all laugh),are you insinuating(all laugh)..’,’Misty ‘mam had changed her surname 11 years ago(all burst into laughter) and would’ve officially confirmed it had you not delayed it like this.your trouble is why would she date people as you broke-up and were nowhere for 4 years(all laugh) and now suddenly you’re back with all these lackies behind you(all laugh) and want to crush the whole world cause why would anyone else look at her(all burst into laughter)...’,’so Mr Morris you can also arrange dates then(all burst into laughter)...’..then sighs(all laugh)..’Ash,please,she never can speak with anyone personally unless it’s you and we all know that stuff,but both me and Hana know very well what you were upto...a man like you can hardly approach anyone(all laugh) and simply your skills and all,only Misty ‘mam is suitable for you(all laugh),get in marry her which you should’ve 7 years ago after that thunder-chair itself(all laugh)..Ash,are you even sane?(all laugh).get this brat off from me(all laugh),Rayquaza tickles him(all laugh)..sighs and laughs at the same time(all laugh)..’yeah,this is called POKEMON MASTERY(all laugh)! Man go to a psychotherapist you know(all laugh)..Mrs Ketchum had spent a total 10 weeks here and you only 8 (all burst into laughter)..and she has seen three shows and YOU NILL(all burst into laughter)..you..sighs..(all laugh)..stop this drama,get this brat off from me,get rid of that Mismagius who is sitting on your shoulder with her back towards me but her face in front of her back not attached to her body with tongues out facing me(all burst into laughter) get rid of these pests become sane and marry Misty ‘mam immediately(all laugh)..’,’i see Vickie too fond(all laugh)...but may come around to challenge your ‘mam and trash-talk the whole gym would you and your family mind(all burst into laughter)?’..again sighs...’don’t defame us(all burst into laughter)’...’no i’ll say you’re cook isn’t good(all burst into laughter)...’,’Ash,don’t waste my time(all laugh)..just marry her let us go(all laugh)...’,’Vickie,tell me about my skills a bit(all laugh)’,’i see,you think that we thought you’re a fluke(all laugh)...you can see for yourself what obsession with battling has done to you(all laugh)...you’ve won everything in a fashion that’s never seen or heard of and now for long none can match you so now want your starter pokmeon again(burst into laughter)...and yeah i know very well how much you ENJOYED the few days you saw Misty ‘mam battling(all burst into laughter)...so only she can be your wife and no matter what you may have done before in your last one and half years of public image no cheerleader or most gentle or most skillfull one would be anywhere near you(all burst into laughter)...what do you actually want tell me...’,’no just control the gym well,if anyone misbehaves(all burst into laughter) during the public match or anything then i may humiliate your Misty ‘mam in public’,’i see you’ll burgain then(all burst into laughter)...after match in front of people give her the ring.good bye(all burst into laughter)’..Kane was reported later i heard who consulted with Harris(all laugh) that this dense brat is failing to stage a SHOWDATE(all burst into laughter) but finally Irene came to know(all laugh) directly calls me scoffing Kane off(all laugh) you know all four ever spoke with me on professional issues(all laugh) and Olivia anyway i know since Johto as does Mist and Brock(all laugh) no Irene was very worried and said the same i said don’t worry i’ll see i’ve got many sources her depression is getting cured for sure but will be in my way i know her too well on every aspect possible as much as she does(all laugh) so Irene was alright so you see basically it was totally mental factor for Mist and the whole world thinks that i’m back means why am i not announcing my marriage(all laugh)..so only the mental factor,which the very begining was enough to end cause i say i want to clarify our break-up cause i’m not sure whether we are clear(all laugh)..she says,’i was clear from my part and i got you clearly but then you gave that note(all laugh)’..so i thought i only needed 2 words(all laugh)...which is the inerrogation of ‘another?’ (all laugh and .) and the insinuation(all laugh) ‘never’(all smile and .)...anyway,thanks(all laugh and cheer)..so(all laugh) i just had to share what i knew cause she was in for traditions after 5 seconds may be(all laugh)...right,as usual(all laugh)...so(all laugh),then tell Drew,who also is privy by then i guessed of the great note(all laugh)..cause Mist invited you all that i knew from Professor and Gary came back said quite a few were present so i knew that this rose will extract information from any underground to vomit it(all burst into laughter)..now mega-Blaziken though(all burst into laughter)..,in that party there was Dr Muk Skechit(all laugh),Mrs Daisy Cascade(all laugh),Doctor Naive Slate(all laugh),most honoured Mrs Violtine Slate(all laugh),Mrs Lillie Garywig(all laugh) and Giraora was set upon him specifically so in a totally messed up psychophysical condition was there abjectly late a certain only Mr Oak Mr Oak(all laugh) and then there was Irene and Kane,Tony and Olivia,Harris and Brenda and Braum and Flavia then there was Mr Ledly and family and Mrs King and family and a few more total 27 and all at Mist flower’s expense(all laugh) and even then had my favourite quickest dish of a banana berry smoothie(all laugh) and i ask Grotham what was she eating then(all laugh) said,everything you liked(all laugh) said neutricious Grotham,used to feed anyway(all laugh)..so sweet my Mist flower(all smile,Ash quickly hugs Misty very firmly smiling at her,Misty smiles at Ash same pose)..anyway,then,after party Doctor Slate and Mrs Slate was furious(all laugh),Harris son was to happily oscillating his head for 2 weaks(all burst into laughter),Kane darling was happily grave at this defamation(all laugh),Irene mole was happy along with all else as soon as i entered Cerulian with all might to get Mist(all laugh) but she though couldn’t express cause of defamation lawsuits(all laugh),Tony boy,Braumy manual and Oliv psycho were saying..hmm..FISHED..(all laugh) and Flavia was brainwashed by Sarah and Brauchy first woman then only man(all brust into laughter) and then Hana and Vickie lad fled the scene immediately next night raising police suspicion using the referee’s associetion who were poked by Simon(all laugh)..so anyway,Kane and all did in their professional talks while i was at Kalos with Lugias did say why bother just date her,i said mate you don’t know me yet(all laugh) then he understood i’ll create a drama to get her herself propose me again so happily stayed mumb(all laugh)..all got that Olivia i only told i’ll see what happens the contract is to get her out of depression(all laugh) she realized it and Harris too did he only said Gyarados’ of such lunacy is cured by only a particular food(all laugh) i said we’ll see about that(all laugh) and the two infatuated brats were jumping up and down still(all laugh) they were tamed by Olivia and Flavia as well who with Brenda just said we’re happy to see your activities reopen at Cerulian(all laugh) i said yeah,3 city circle so yeah(all laugh) anyway,then after get-together Kane called said propose her she’s waiting to devour you up only(all laugh) i said all in personal times(all laugh) rest were too happy but Harris was furious said,man can’t you stop this drama(all alugh) i said well i’m a pro now full time 2nd phase of career(all laugh) anyway,then Mr Drew Blackmore calls,’hellow Mr Blackmore,nice to meet you(all laugh) but Mr Blackmore,why do you think because i’ve haunted grounds and given notes means i’ve married a cetain Ms Waterflower(all laugh)’,’Ketchum yeah(all burst into laughter)’,’still Ms aint it’(all burst into laughter)’,’i before t to end yeah(all laugh)’,’which also gives mind the circumstances here in my mind another word it’s strength of sound with the V(all burst into laughter)’,’Ash,please you don’t need to do these things and you know our door is ever open to you without any memory of anything that happened in the past and your sis is only waiting for you to smile at her again and she herself will hug you to death...me and your sis have recently come to know that we’re expecting our future and this news may sound nice to you now that you’ve kindly remembered your wife(all laugh) and hence the phonecall...we don’t know much about your antics but we know more than well the legend that you are now incomparable all time and everone knows about your undercover work in team rocket,you know as much as me about our familiarity(all laugh) and Misty certainly reciprocates to your character by her own and you don’t want to say it nor does she and will long for each other and die yet not meet again or YOU will not let others make the arrangements again which Misty certainly wanted but gave up as we all done and it’s alright even if me and your sis break up even now,she will do it and so will i that atleast let others make the arrangements and that to you obviously is not good enough.Ash,you realize that your career may be is over forever due to the impossible height of your bunch and your skills and now wisdom finally dawns upon you that whole life you can’t be battling unless you’re insane and thus your endeavours and all we know is that Misty is only waiting for you to ask her out for a date and that half an hour is enough for her to happily change her surname.think about it as i’m too sure you would’ve ever have anyone else unless they came all by themselves and could keep pace with you and your demands which i know only too well(all laugh) and which only Misty could do as you did(all burst into laughter) and has been doing always(all burst into laughter).that’s all.thank...’,’wait wait wait...hang on dear old 13 comrade(all laugh),first many congratulations heartfelt to you and your wife and the very best and fervant wishes for your future,may you all ever be blessed and just confirm your wife’s belief that ideas including personal relations are bigger than persons across timescales...but the only thing that’s unclear is that why can’t i dump this concerned Ms Waterflower by vomitting off again?’...’cause you will clean it only as Misty is bigger than ideas including that of a fiancee beyond timescales to you bye(all laugh).’...so that shrewd rose(all laugh) was volunteering to force others to volunteer to make the Elite4 vounteer to make voluntary arragements(all burst into laughter)...and this devillish rose will be patiently waiting to spew on me AGAIN(all burst into laughter)...anyway,these two phonecalls made me laugh really cause my mom knows that you go to one date to know each other,next to confirm the knowledge(all laugh),third to propose(all laugh),fourth is to make other arrangements and fifth is the after marriage first day(all laugh)..so i was at the 5th(all laugh)..and this shrew knows hat one must rose up to maximum(all laugh) and FOLLOW(all laugh) all the way for 3 and half years(all laugh) only to be either at the next city or the previous(all burst into laughter)..by the way he followed via tracking gyms(all laugh) as his friend was trainer and was travelling and had may be 6000 ways(all laugh)...and he was 16(all burst into laughter) and the trainer was just Tony boy(all laugh) and shrew minutely learnt the following,rosing and information extraction technique for one year(all laugh)...he as usual first saw May and just like May recognized the soulmate thing and was fooling around to have a grasp at our cost of roses and proposals(all laugh)...i told May that this brat is following us i’m informing the police(all burst into laughter),’huh,as if you don’t follow Misty(all laugh)..6 days phonecall nobody listens and you say you don’t follow,WE CALL ONLY 5 TIMES(all burst into laughter)..um..i mean..(all laugh)...’,’yeah,let it go too thorny(all laugh)..’..she was 17 then,’hum,what did you say(all burst into laughter)’,’nothing but if Combusken vs Bulbasaur in 4th round 5th minute 2 challenger down..(all burst into laughter)’..she knew atleast this means that’s it lets BATTLE(all laugh)..so she would leave or BATTLE(all laugh)..actually she did battle more(all burst into laughter)..and that hidden iron determination and zeal to surmount anything depite her eversweet nature is what has made her what she is now professionally you know too reddened(all laugh)..anyway,Drew’s method of getting rid of pests was formality and humility actually(all laugh)..he would at first go there with all flairs to keep up the jealousy story then as soon as pests were at him,’ ‘mam’(all burst into laughter)..actually i copied it from him(all laugh)...ever the best weapon(all laugh)..’shame ‘mam(all burst into laughter)’..’sir(all laugh),please sir,let me serve you sir,please express you wish sir(all burst into laughter)’..and only this shrewd brat could follow May like that and draw 3 times(all burst into laughter)...i asked later why the hell did you two roam around together for 7.5 years sharing everything and then only married despite being 20 when you first started(all burst into laughter) that age that is(all burst into laughter)..this was on their marriage..’bro you don’t understand these anymore,you’re in Kalos now too egotistitical too much money(all laugh)..and you do know well what professionality does to one...just hope your ego comes down and you become like before,and no please this isn’t about what you think just for our relation that’s all and also i’m a judge and thus not battling anymore(all laugh)’..and the rose says,’um..Ash..you know that we shared everything even in professional life so absolutely did in personal life in difficulties and now so happy that you’ll see that together and judge the performance together professionally not competiting anymore and thus among us the professional barrier isn’t anymore so the equality like has always been but before obscured by professional life now is only all vividly shining(all smile and .)’..’yeah,can’t better her so lesser her(all burst into laughter and .)...’,’yeah,like battle her every minute spoiling her and thus me so we drew all the way(all laugh) and the word too(all burst into laughter) and now the whole world can’t battle you every minute so you’re this...but yes ego vs Ash Ketchum abovecover Kalos round 5 minutes 57 seconds in,win that one,bye(all . and laugh)’...those two are something 3 drawn grand contests that too Orange incuded(laugh,all laugh)...anyway,so mom shrewdly(all laugh) was knocking the door(all laugh),then went on doing things and all..
yeah by the way now the great Frank Cutcher(all laugh)...’Mr Cutcher,I’m....’,’Mr Ash Ketchum,Pokemon Master,Hall of Fame,i know Mr Ketchum,your men has had a meeting with me,i hope you’ve known what went on in that.’...Gengleye suddenly appears just in front of him(all laugh) and the light is off(all laugh)...anyway just before he was out of the hallucination,i sweetly say this,’sweet sweet Frankie lad(all laugh),why do i find this infatuation especially at youger ages in both male and female brats(all laugh) with the BEAUTY of the BODY-URINE and STOOL(all burst into laughter)’...the brat is so puzzled(all laugh)..just came out and Gengleye was still at him and then he doesn’t know what to do or say or feel(all burst into laughter)...then i walk off saying,’remeber this for this and when again someone at 25 is too interested about your 21 year future cause of the future exuberence and innocence(all laugh).thank you Mr Frankieboy Cutcher(all laugh)’...then walk off Gengar then licks him to hell and Sableye compels him to reciprocate only tickling(all burst into laughter)...that brat will remember those 10 minutes forever(all laugh)...later i heard that his bro and Dolores was scrared to absolute death(all laugh)..Frank first thought licking is a warning(all burst into laughter)..then of course later after the gifts realized the prank and you know his position in the city(all laugh) and was in tears with joy i heard(all laugh)..cause of the anatomy of course(all laugh)..yeah was present at the show(all burst into laughter)..and then met Mist of all again(all laugh)..Mist says i just said yeah Hi,’ um ‘mam(all laugh)...then compliments for the show..and yeah his wife was present too(all laugh)..almost ate him up(all laugh)..his 8 year old son asked him dad who is my soulmate(all laugh uncontrollably)..anyway(all laugh),he says,’but Mrs Ketchum,um..why did you come back actually(all laugh)..?’..that was fun..any single that was present(all laugh)..all said like,’hmm..(all laugh)..projection..hmm..(all burst into laughter)...’...but Kane summed it up beautifully,’um..then dates are also about philsophical discourses you say(all burst into laughter)..’...yeah,a Mr jackal too agrees(all burst into laughter)..cause the word is hangout(all burst into laughter)...this cunning second cousin(all laugh) and thus this researcher VEIL(all burst into laughter)...this impersonal reservational wiggedly ORDERED FOODS(all burst into laughter)...and this IDEA of Mantinal Viridan Nights(all laugh)..at Hurb’s Special each comeback NIGHTS(all laugh)..neutritious(all burst into laughter)...and(all burst into laughter) too much phonecall at lunch time(all laugh)..so lets return to a Mr Cutcher..and then his great big bro(all laugh),he was also scared to death first and then gifts come and doesn’t know which side to sail to(all laugh)... and then Leo of all(all laugh),and he had to be in Indigo Platue(all burst into laughter)...’Sir,immediately give up your license,achievements,all pokemons except starter,the case...talks about the case... has been re opened you fought for a human prize,you’re banned FOR LIFE’...yeah they said that summoning him to the HQ main office(all burst into laughter)...he totally broke down actually says all sorts of things then my name is uttered and almost faints(all laugh) cause he knew about my realtionship with Mist and says all and tells them not to let me trash talk him and family and all(all laugh)..man that was something as they so jovially told me and then after everything is done,’so sir would you like a bonus(all burst into laughter)’...then he is given somethings as gift or something says,’um..thanks but why is he not giving these to her?(all burst into laughter)..’ and then Dolores too was told that the case will reopen and all and then they dragged her whole family(all laugh and shake their heads)...she was also in tears and did what she did and all..next day she,her husband and 2 kids were about to leave for some place to get away(all laugh),pacrel comes for her kids a few girfts and then at their workplaces some things are done(all smile)..this confuses them even more(all laugh)..later they told me she asks,’um..Mr Ash Ketchum..is he alright ?(all burst into laughter)..’ ..the whole city was scared to death really and yet couldn’t warn each other cause 2 Elite4s were after them and they knew my image and knew that the other Elite4s will jump on them too unless they and their pokebrats behaved(all laugh)...but then all informations we get and then all gets Gengleyed(all laugh)..but i didn’t include the best meeting i had when i came back VIA Orange head quarters on the way to Safforn again after Lugia delima was the men whoose beauty had surpassed the word beauty according to me and Trace happily reciprocated(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing)...so these beautiful men i met after the haunt in Cerulian and i had to be present myself cause they did the honours first and yeah i had Glalie(all laugh)...but was inside(all laugh) and brought her to me the day Muk was sent back...so these beautiful men had just about started the saloon(all laugh) there and i went at the office was a coffee meeting as usual(all laugh)..actually in a private cell(all laugh)...anyway,so there i asked the men,who were alerted before that i will come that i just want a few informations that’s all,the men themselves told me in details about certain phonecalls that were talked about and said everything without me saying another word but that was 30 minutes max(all laugh) their whole lives were foisted upon me(all burst into laughter) and then professioinal discussions started(all laugh),20 more minutes or so they had to know a few things to clarify on illegal substances on UNOVA-KALOS BREAKAWAY POKEMONS(all laugh) cause i’m a specialist now(all laugh)..now even more way more as you know what i do to pass my day(all laugh)...the specises were Palkia(all laugh),Hydreigon(all laugh),how’s the weather(all laugh) and finally Reshiram(all laugh),wasn’t i there(all laugh)....may be 20 minutes beaked my head off(all laugh), then i was asked of my methods of self introspection(all burst into laughter) to which i said i don’t have to handle hazards at offices where they don’t know that winning a regional league is actually a too difficult thing to achieve,which sweetened the men(all burst into laughter) who THEN told about their beautiful women(all burst into laughter) to which i had to say that why the beautiful personal lives are opened unto ugly men(all laugh) to which they said they know only too well about things but they never knew about other things(all laugh) and one year was huge(all laugh) to which i said that not for nothing was my image at press so dreaded(all laugh) thus please consider it(all laugh) but then these men were more beautified(all laugh) said their beautiful women didn’t know everything(all laugh) i said as they should be(all laugh) but then these men were extremely beautified(all laugh) to which i said offices are strict(all burst into laughter) but to my utter irritation the men said that they will be excused cause for my other services at the office which was to tolerate people who made me talk for a full hour on everything about legendary pokemons like Zengstrong(all laugh) little did i know that those brats were hovering around may be just outside the office(all laugh) anyway,i told them about legendary battles of Team Rocket and all and told them why they shouldn’t jump into the ocean ill-prepared with a Marill(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) and especially not before knowing what exact process will make your 21 year long starter who didn’t evole cause of human activities(all laugh) to suddenly but methodically turn on you(all laugh,all cheer for Tracey,who bursts into laughter) no the 8/9 that were present atleast 3 did want to protest but gauging the situation and their own livelihood and personal lives absolutely correctly 2 changed designations and another fled the scene at the right time cause she was informed about her future and thus it became easier for her to go for a prolonged vacation whoose husband contacted me a gentleman from outside of our profession,much later cause she remembered the discussion and thus i came to know all these and he said that he never expected such things cause to him our profession was pretty honest(all laugh) i said just enjoy the pokemons and their trainers and the mutual skill during battles cause that’s the point nothing more...and the other 2 men as i said was extremly prudent and used their other half advantages rightly...anyway,lets talk about psychothrombonosis Trace,please a bit we need  refreshment cause i’m foolish(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “the way to cut off half grown Azurill’s tail by blades while the concerned full growned forsaken Azumarill(all laugh) waterguns me to choking(all laugh) or psychics me to permanent cosmic void to immitate Gengleye(all laugh)...um...(all laugh)..’
Ash(laugh) : “Misty’s husband isnt’t it Trace,Misty’s husband(all laugh)..Trace why do your good sweet days look at Misty’s husband’s Misty(all burst into laughter)..?”
Daisy(laugh) : “to see the how much the reddishness increases gradually covering the visional aparatus to a whole when the a certain Waterdos sees a certain Angel being sweetly Melodius while booking Elesaahes(all burst into laughter)”
Tracey(laugh) : “i can’t know you but you can know me thus i too will know you my sweet sweet Melody (all burst into laughter,.)..”
Brock(laugh) : “ seeing the Angels through Mist and haze(all laugh)/hearing the Melodies rejecting young flower craze(all burst into laughter)/Booking the Massies behind friendly Misty gaze(all laugh)/we’ll never know the exact reason for 4 year long rage(all burst into laughter)  ”
Gary(laugh) : “Elesa(all burst into laughter)..you..sweetie(all burst into laughter)..”
Misty(iriitated,hugging Ash very firmly,Ash laughs and keeps tendering Misty) : “SHUT UP!(all burst into laughter)..you namecall failed to control a Magby(all burst into laughter) so now conspire with your Devilil(all laugh) to keep my husband from calling me(all burst into laughter) during lunch each day(all laugh)...my(all laugh)...my Ash(all laugh)is..my(all laugh)..MY sweetie(all burst into laughter)...you(all laugh) namecall(all laugh) why does your wife eavesdrop my Ash during our call(all burst into laughter)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “(song) 
“
My heart is so disguised(all burst into laughter)
I just can't live a lie anymore
I would rather hurt myself
Than to ever make my Ash cry(all laugh)
There's nothing left to try
Though it's gonna hurt us both
There's no other way than to say good-bye

(all burst into laughter .) “

Violet(laugh) : “ (song)

I can honestly say you've been on my mind
Since I woke up today, up today
I look at your photograph all the time(all burst into laughter)
These memories come back to life
And I don't mind(all laugh)
I woke up this morning
And played our song
And through my tears, I sang along
I picked up the phone and then put it down
Cause I know I'm wasting my time(all burst into laughter)
And I don't mind(all laugh)
Cause i have forgotten you(all burst into laughter,.) 
Ash,just good-bye,good-bye
Oh! Ash good-bye,good-bye

Misty(very agitated,hugs Ash very firmly and then again resting her head on his chest,Ash laughs and hugs Misty very firmly then tenders her) : “SHUT UP!(all burst into laughter and .)...he’s(all laugh)only my Ash(all burst into laughter)..um..he’s my hubby(all burst into even more laughter)...my(all laugh) sweet bee(all laugh)..why(all laugh) are you disturbing my Ash at night too(all burst into laughter)...and if you say i don’t cherish him...how(all laugh) can you say that my sweet bee hasn’t projected me out fully(all laugh)...HE’LL(all laugh) SHOW YOU YOU NAMECALLS(all burst into laughter)..Ash why do these full grown infatuated namecalls disturb us(all burst into laughter)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “AH!the longing the longing(all burst into laughter)...”
Brock(laugh) : “cause we cherish him so much(all burst into laughter)..plus there’s no gurantee that other girls unknown to us aren’t in the rounds and Ash isn’t actually thinking about them while being with Misty flower(all laugh) the theory as well as the abstract idea of girlhood(all burst into laughter) are made universal(all burst into laughter and .)”
Gary(laugh) : “tomorrow...again(all burst into laughter,.)”
Daisy(laugh) : “
(somg)
we were told that Late last night, 
Ash asked Misty
"Am I the most important thing?"
It's looming that Misty might lose Ash
that Ash doesn't cherish Misty like he used to

Violet(laugh) : “

............................................................................................................................................................
(2 days later,night,middle)

Ash(laugh) : “then lets finish with Elesa cause those fights were something and i just am giving an example by this match cause this was the start there and i did about 12.7 gyms per month average(all laugh)...but Elesa uses THUNDURUS(all laugh) greets me saying are you single(all laugh) i say no(all laugh) suspiciously looks at Iris of all people(all burst into laughter) who screams(all burst into laughter),’you namecall(all laugh) i’m calling Elite4(all laugh)’...now Cili was silently laughing(all laugh) gets him,’um..is she your cousin(all burst into laughter)..’ I was just enjoying the fun this was 1st gym itself(all laugh),Elesa was 35,extremely good(all laugh)...right(all laugh),and she was in hall of fame for just 1 year by then started from 20 just like Mist did after travelling Unova and Kalos throughly and Nimbasa was a huge destination anyway so now Cili is asked a double edged question(all burst into laughter) to which Cili’s ever great method of getting rid of pests was that,’ um..Mrs Elesa(all laugh)...’ that was it(all laugh) Elesa gets very grave(all laugh) and lectures them(all burst into laughter) that that moment in Sinnoh was magic(all burst into laughter) her line up was Thundurus(all laugh),Zekrom(all laugh) and finally Tapu Koko(all laugh) so then i go with Luxray and Chu (all laugh) and Rotom(all laugh) gets in first Thundurus(all laugh) who uses psychics and all doesn’t work cause Luxray gets the X-ray(all laugh) realizes the tricks and the agility is almost equal to Thundurus tells me can how long should i tolerate these antics(all burst into laughter) i say be carefull the brat is stronger than you,scoffs at me(all laugh) no those conversations really was something(all laugh) says,’are you telling me to unnecessary go the distance like your 3rd class egotistical brat did(all burst into laughter)’ that class is to show the level difference of that attack(all laugh) i say don’t waste your time concentrate(all laugh) says,’yeah,yeah,as ever doesn’t know a thing how to turn pests away from door and not invite them to bedroom first then start a skirmish(all burst into laughter)’ i was laughing saying,’just get on be concentrated’ then goes for some minute 2/3(all laugh) and finally Thundurus wants to tire Luxray out then we both say won’t tolerate the bratly antics(all laugh) then we poke the brat by trash talking(all laugh) those trash talks was that your grielfriend is better looking for your comfort(all burst into laughter) or Thundurus was told if try to recall i think we repeatedly said,’but are you a good husband(all burst into laughter)’ so eventually the brat gets irritated and Elesa understands 10 minutes later that now is the time to thunder-chair(all laugh) tells the brat(all lusgh) Thundurus goes to his fullest with 2 levels above thunder-chair that Chu used(all laugh) cause it’s about better husbands(all laugh) Luxray takes it full blast(all laugh) nothing happens(all laugh) then Thundurus self heals as does Luxray and Luxray does it way way quicker cause he was laughing after the blow(all laugh) then Luxray goes to self destruction mood then that is he will not need pokecentre(all laugh) but won’t be able to fight again that day(all laugh) that was there ultimate strength that just two levels below that pokecentre level(all laugh) to Voltagegauge-psychogoic-crystaled-lightened-thunder-chair(all burst into laughter) within 3 months another pokemon topples Chu’s level by 18(all burst into laughter) and match the 800 year record of 15 by betterring it to 3(all laugh) that’s the basic thunderbolt level that a Luxray would use to get a Goldeen at ground(all laugh) but that thunderbolt basic is from Zapdos(all laugh) which at present including the one he didn’t go that day is about 685 (all laugh) that’s the hightest electric legend known a Lightenthunstrom normal mad(all laugh) can’t better that brat or anyone higher in a Luxray body(all laugh) but in Zekrom mind you can go another four levels(all laugh) which is exactly why they stand no chance against either of them most(all laugh)...so Thundurus is fried out(all laugh) Elesa says match done(all burst into laughter) i cry to the whole world don’t get me unemployed by rejecting me(all burst into laughter) then Elesa sighs(all laugh) gets Zekrom(all laugh),who comes and uses another thunder-chair to match the level of Thundurus (all laugh) and this is against Chu(all laugh) who goes to the same level as Luxray and stays for 1 second more(all laugh) to rile Luray up(all laugh)... then Zekrom joins Thundurus to pokecentre(all laugh) then Elesa begs me(all laugh) those were the best two out of 3(all laugh) i say,’ ‘mam(all laugh) i have a ghost-electric(all burst into laughter)’..becomes very happy(all laugh) cause now thunder-chairs arent coming so goes her best elcetric(all laugh) Tapu Koko(all laugh) never saw that one before of course cause he was triple level mega elovoluted(all laugh) so goes in Rotom(all laugh) shows each form saying you don’t have so many forms how can you scoff your girlfriend for not liking you(all laugh) how can she cause you girlfriend sees each day same form(all laugh uncontrollably) extremely agitated Tapu Koko becomes cause no matter what he says the answer is all cause his girlfriend is upset(all laugh) then goes to thunder chair(all laugh) goes 1 level above Thundurus and Zekrom(all laugh),comes in hallucination of girlfriends doing the same to him(all burst into laughter) and Rotom just uses the dark-electric guard which only my Chu or Luxray could beat(all laugh) this agitates Tapu Koko more and he misbehaves(all laugh) by going another level up(all laugh) but before he can execute all his girlfriends are fondling those many Rotoms with their different forms and he is standing aside menaing rejected(all laugh) so Tapu Koko just loses it cause Rotom is so powerfull and is pestering him to death no matter what he does(all laugh) and cries(all burst into laughter) saying you rejected yours and so after mine(all burst into laughter) to which Rotom says mine looks better(all burst into laughter) yes all these while Tapu Koko is in psychic communication(all laugh) then eventually Rotom uses a thunder-chair(all laugh) of course then he couldn’t reach that level so just touches Nigel(all burst into laughter) and this is while hallucinating his girlfriend and Tapu Koko’s side by side to insinuate(all burst into laughter)...Tapu Koko admits defeat(all laugh) by quitting(all laugh) that’s the first challenger who quitted despite having a lots of gas left in the tank cause of the pokemind-games(all laugh) which was my first experience with those and later now it’s what it is(all laugh)..all legends kept playing these games too but their want of victory ultimately toppled themselves cause mine were never wanting that(all laugh) that’s just joking like we’re doing no harms meant(all laugh)...but still it was ethically done(all laugh)..so i get the badge in privacy(all burst into laughter) asks about my girlfriend again(all laugh) and i say no out of profession,a certain company now met her in a grass competition(all laugh) ages ago dated right after(all laugh) later she changed profession very intellectual(all burst into laughter) and just that we’re too fond of each other and i’m getting ever more so(all laugh)...then come in and all but after the first 5 gyms all were above 45(all laugh) mostly(all laugh) and then my disposition totally changed(all laugh) and during the last 30 gyms except for the leader people were shuddering(all laugh) cause Chu was sparking all time(all laugh) and so on in last 50 gyms Cili didn’t enter(all laugh) Iris did and sat like a statue(all laugh) i came back cheered her up for her badge(all laugh) which was a normal fight(all laugh) and Iris thus had 300 badges(all laugh) out of which 230 were 1 on 1 4 minutes(All laugh) some experience Unova was(all laugh) Cili only then talked about cooking(all laugh)...and after the 1st badge i tell my flower things that went on,she was very happy but just wanted to be beside me so much then that was her talk and i only wanted that then and we hardly were talking about pokemons except 15 minutes in 1:15(all laugh) contemplated each other while gazing at each other in silence for 30(all laugh) and rest 30 was about everything personal(all laugh)...and Mist was just like a 16 year old then couldn’t forcefully tell me a thing and was always about moisting the screen(all laugh) i used to pat her to restart the gym(all laugh) or sleep and told her to eat and sleep well i’ll call again tomorrow or at night(all smile) just became like a little kid and i had to do everything(all smile,Misty smiles at Ash while in same pose,Ash reciprocates then same pose)..and this system of becoming a kid was also shown to her but in a different manner by our Violet sister(all laugh) who now does that and each time the crook(all laugh) has to return immediate cause if he doesn’t he will be accused of for not spoiling great professionals(all laugh) or that his gym leading sentiment doesn’t like a certain Mantine(all laugh) anyway to go back to Unova,it all was good but after those 5 gyms it was getting hard for me cause now my own brats were not tolerating each other(all laugh) and Gary knows each day i would change a few(all laugh) grass turned on water who on fire who on electric who turned on grass(all laugh) then ground was on rock and the rock was on steel who again turned on ground(all laugh) cause rock was just Tyranitar against each(all laugh) but each ghost were at Tyranitar’s side using dark sentiment(all laugh) and Solgaleo got the pure psychic bunch(all laugh) who were at each other saying this is why they think fondly of Feraligator(all burst into laughter) which was brushed aside by grass and electric bunch and fires said this is patronization(all laugh) cause those damn brats know more than themselves(all laugh) without Crawdaunt the divisons can’t be done(all burst into laughter) then Bulbasaur was brought who turned each on me(all laugh) and took the side Luxray(all laugh) Chu was lecturing each to disobey me(all laugh) cause i was sweet little bro anything who didn’t know(all laugh),Luxray was chiding Chu saying don’t waste you time lecturing get those namecalled grass(all laugh) which Bulbasaur opined to be a must cause he was getting poisonous(all laugh),Muk came one day said this is utter disgrace that pokepeople are being hindered by me to get more intellectual(all laugh) then finally Crawdauntogator was brought in(all laugh) Gary was so happy that day(all laugh) cause he and Trace saw stupendous fights at lab 24/7(all laugh) then Feraligator said i was unhappy to be held back(all laugh) by our namecalled master(all laugh) which Crawdaunt wholehearted agreed to saying because of him a few choised namecalles got away from him(all laugh) like that brat Ultranercozma(all laugh) who obviously they didn’t know what that name meant(all laugh) i said you lost to a ghost-dragon-steel-dark-psychic type(all laugh) immediately Crawdaunt turned on each prychics i had(all laugh) then the darks joined to which other water types said Crawdaunt gets unfair afvantage for being dual type(all laugh) to which Feraligator scoffed at Crawdaunt saying why are you waiting for these brats to talk jump upon them(all laugh) so that Feraligator can then backstab Crawdaunt(all laugh) who in return said you’re afraid of the electric group get them(all laugh) so that he will divide the Feraligators friends in such divisions that major dark types went to Feraligator then rest will complain partiality(all laugh)...this was going on and then i soffed at Crawdaunt saying you lost said because of you(all laugh) to which Feraligator pointed out that he was since the very first day telling me and those other namecalles that were around me(all burst into laughter) to be not serious at all(all laugh) i rebuked them sayig you’re insulting my girlfriend(all laugh) beware(all laugh) which to them meant a pokemon named girlfriend(all burst into laughter) whom they thoroughly namecalled(all laugh) some were like whoose his or her beau(all laugh) some said what type is she let the namecall face us(all laugh) and i’m elaborating that phase cause i havent and that was real funny but extremely scary stuff(all laugh)..TYRAniTAR(all laugh)..just think about that and this version(all laugh) he was most incensed cause he was only rock later got Lycanroc but by then things became contemplative(all laugh) then some opined that girlfriendmon was the reason why the idiotic master was misbehaving(all burst into laughter) i told them my girlfriend is like Gyarados(all laugh) then some said two pokemons let 200 come(all laugh) we’ll show them some said whoose Gyarados(all laugh) to which the other answered that’s the beau(all burst into laughter) get that damn brat(all laugh) then type infighting started and odd numbered ones wanted Tyranitar(all laugh),he was the master at that type ever in demand and you know what he did each day(all laugh)..Gary was told by hallucinations to feed him some namecalled brat each day(all laugh)..Noctowl went against Tyranitar once(all laugh) and thst Noctowl if you saw which Gary did(all laugh) he himself was a rock type then(all laugh) i had Tyranitar a total of 100 days with me cause he was crazy(all laugh) and many times had 40 with me(all laugh) many wanted to come out of pokeballs all the time to who i said you’re scared to be inside..whoose inside(all laugh)..who is he dating(all laugh) others pointed to Charizard(all burst into laughter) who said let the dam grass types come(all laugh),Hercross was lifting Dragonite each day(all laugh) then Dragonite himself became very dangerous and was after everyone(all laugh) then to return to girlfriendmon(all laugh) each match i was asked whoose that brat(all laugh) and then they knew girlfriendmon had Gyaradosmon(all laugh) who was more loated cause she was the beau(all laugh) so most dangeorus then i named each of Mist’s bunch whoose types werent with me and each became girlfriendmon or the beaus(all laugh) so finally i said if you want to face girlfriend then unite(all burst into laughter) which they thought of(all laugh) but after a few days and all the shuffing of bunch the whole group united cause of girlfriend named unknown namecall(all burst into laughter) then later each dragon came were girlfriend(all laugh),Nivy ever fled the scene(all laugh) cause he was first and was startled to see my nature and these brats(all laugh) then of course he and all else were united due to girlfriend who were in plural and from my own bunch(all burst into laughter) thus they were infighting cause that was their food as the gym food was pathetic(all laugh) then these were going and i started to learn why they were behaving like that and all and then slowly got insights that i can never express if i’m not a pokemon myself(all laugh) each time Charla came(all laugh) it was trouble to which Charizard scoffed them saying tell this master namecall to let me fly quickest so that i’m with my beau each day after ridiculousity(all laugh) and then Charla too was fighting with them(all laugh) but eventually after the first day they let her off(all laugh) and then Charizard each day agitated the fire group of backstabbing him(all laugh) which mean Chu and Luxray who got Rotom and his sworn in enemy Whimsicott(all laugh) to go at each other(all laugh) these were going and they never listened to me but their thing was that we won’t kill a pokemon or harm anyone but we need to show our strenghts and they being pokemons couldn’t suppress each and each attack and badge would come with swearing(all laugh) saying they aren’t happy at all that the gym brats were mentally so naive(all laugh) Chu was going to all hells with art of battling and then Nivy and all learnt things at an impossible pace and that Noivern was so dangerous at few gyms were all dreaded and each day shouted at the other dragons saying they were a shame for thier type(all laugh) then each were getting upto the level my Garchomp was a brat thirsty brat(all laugh) went against Tyranitar and whoose natural insanity to fight himself(all laugh) didn’t help any and each day and night they were fighting while in cities they were at the sky fighting(all laugh) with Yveltal(all laugh) who each day told me to go to the sky myself to see how he roasts some choised brats inlcuding all their beaus’s all beaus(all laugh) all around me was so scrared and then the playboy image started all those scary things were ulterior(all laugh) yeah Chu,Togademaru,Heliolisk and Luxray thunder-chaired each other atleast 50 times per day and Luxray was there all along cause i didn’t have another pure electric type to control Chu and Heliolisk and Togademaru was rotated cause they had other types(all laugh) and Snorlax’s group was light(all laugh) and Tyranitar was alone so sent him back(all laugh) here each day he would go against the whole Magmorter group(all laugh) which probably has spoiled him as you see(all laugh) then later their fight was like water would turn on grass who on fire this after 4 months or so cause now they realized that disadvantages are too naive(all laugh) and that Spiritomb was feared by all then(all laugh) everyday would say those namecalleds that slipped away from grasp last hour(all laugh) and so on i told Mist that they are always agitated and wants to fight so i told them that my girlfriend will teach them a lesson and now you’re their number one enemy(all laugh) and Mist said don’t take Glalie(all laugh)...but they never attacked as you know except the normal type attacks all were mental games and thus their intercommunication and same when they went up in the sky and thus just knew everything about everything and each day i had to tell them about thousand different imaginary pokemons names whoose attacks was mutually fixed and then were charged at(all laugh) and i each moment was getting nervous shocks to see them and realizing what they were doing and eventually that thirst for battle engulfed me and i became as much dangerous(all laugh) i said who that Chu get him(all laugh) to which Chu scoffed that thunder-chair me(all laugh) some jumped me with all sorts of psychic disturbances and all those who weren’t psychics still could connect to me and all and Charizard was kept apart cause of flying schedules(all laugh) then one by one and i remember that order only i don’t remember any other order except the first 4 upto Bulbasaur and just remember their region but Unova was there cause these poor guys came to me for something good and i was roaming around with about 72 lunactics once only(all laugh) well those who were caught or came knew them only then came(all laugh) just Incineroar the very very last came absolutely by himself i didn’t do 1 thing there must’ve picked up Chu and my bond somehow and for fire fight you understand(all laugh) and i also don’t recall who were caught who weren’t or how were caught except a few here and there and in Unova only Garchomp asked me via Chu to prove to him that i was able to cause he is so freedom loving in reflection(all laugh) others normally caught just came or like that Garchomp all by himself still starangely asked and asked Chu just a thunder-chair(all laugh) that was enough and when i returned here after Unova Garchomp was mad(all laugh) but said like he feels bad to be caught cause 2 choised brats like Tyrangaleo wasn’t(all laugh) then in Unova first came Noivern very 1st month just after went there and started(all laugh) you know his story revolution against new young leader for being abstract(all laugh) breeding season skirmishes just that age(all laugh) then so basically this was first month and thus i do count Dragonite very next month first week after Nivy so taking it as first 1st,and i also remember who came by themselves and except Solgaleo cause that kind of a pokemon came all by himself my first one like that i was 20 so that i recall Dragonite too by himself came,Naganadel caught same month 1st,Palkia himself 2nd,Rayquaza caught 3rd,Goodra himself 5th ,Hoopa himself 6th,Aegislash by himself 7th,Dialga caught 8th,Reshiram himself jumped on Charizard for tips(all laugh) 10th,Chanedlure herself 10th,Kyurem caught 12th,Hydreigon herself 14th,Confragigus himself 15th,please welcome Zekrom(all laugh) of course by herself(all laugh) kind of jumped upon Goodra and Dialga of all (all laugh) 17th,Guzzlord(all laugh) himself 18th he jumped on Reshiram(all laugh), Latios herself 20th,Giratina Mr Oak(all laugh) himself jumped on everyone at deepest Karapaskar(all laugh) 21st ,Garchomp caught 23rd and Garchomp was last in Unova next 7 months all about gyms(all laugh) and Garchomp remains my last caught pokemon and will remain this term for sure(all laugh) and only 5 were caught rest 14 by themselves came along(all laugh) and before Garchomp Kyurem was last caught 11 months back then had Hydreigon,Confragigus,Zekrom,Guzzlord,Latios,Giratina all by themselves and 4 psudeo legends then that brat jumped me in Unova and after that incident only Garchomp came and was caught and also was the last caught but it didn’t help me cause i thought due to previous 6 being all on their own suddenly a brat then Garchomp strangely asks to prove the honesty didn’t help at all(all laugh)...but later realized just the reflections of thunder(all laugh) and not one ghost has been caught since Trevenant(all laugh),then Nivy took 3 months to warm up to Tyranitar next 18 to get starved(all laugh) then next 4 to calm down(all laugh) by next 10 months the full philosopher was out(all laugh) so it took 36 months for him to attain his state by the time i went undercover with very first 3/4 weaks wanted not to battle(all laugh) but had to and each time their mind games saved me(all laugh),Dragonite same took 3 months to warm up Nivy one more cause he was alone as dragon(all laugh),Naganadel same,Palkia took 5-18-3 so was ready then,Rayquaza 4-18-3 then each of these 5 took 10 months to get the jovial nature out(all laugh) then these pests were ready by undercover(all laugh) Goodra very quick took one month to warm up(all laugh) it was 2-17-4-4(all laugh),Hoopa 3-15-2(all laugh) ghosts will be(all laugh) and took only 4 months to cool down(all laugh) now the rest didn’t take an year to get jovial(all laugh) but the 18 was mandatory for these brats(all laugh),Dialga, 3-18-2-6,Aegislash,2-15-2-4(all laugh),Reshiram,2-18-3-7,this brat cooled down after i returned(all laugh),Chanedlure 2-16-2-3(all laugh),Kyurem,2-18-4-4,this brat cooled when i was in undercover(all laugh),now these brats didn’t wait that long being starved(all laugh) so Hydreigon,2-16-2-3,Confragigus,2-13-1-1(all laugh),Zekrom(all laugh) 2-15-1-2(all laugh) that Zekrom was expressive wife(all laugh) now these brats now didn’t require more than 14(all laugh),Guzzlord(all laugh),2-14-1-2(all laugh),Latios,2-12-1-1(all laugh),Giratina(all laugh) Mr Oak Mr Oak did 2-10-1-1(all laugh),Garchomp,2-11-2-1(all laugh) so from my beginning in Unova if i calculate, Garchomp was done in 39 from 23,Giratina in 35 from 21(all laugh) yeah on the month of entering undercover was an absolute brat there(all laugh),Latios 36 from 20 same time this brat and Giratina the two natural opposites there were much to the whole world’s misfortune bossom soulmates then(all laugh),Guzzlord 37 from 18 in balanced honesty(all laugh),Zekrom 36 from 17(all laugh),Confragigus 32 from 15(all laugh),Hydreigon 38 from 14,Kyurem 39 from 12 third longest(all laugh),Chanedlure 32 from 10(all laugh),Reshiram 40 from 10 longest yet within 40(all laugh) this brat and Kyurem were at each other during the end months last(all laugh),Dialga 37 from 8 second longest in the end was at everyone(all laugh),Aegislash 31 from 7(all laugh),Hoopa 30 from 6(all laugh),yeah during the finals dragged Hoopa and Aegislash wasn’t happy either(all laugh),Goodra 32 from 5 was just about there(all laugh),Rayquaza 38 from 3 poor kids(all laugh),Palkia 36 from 2(all laugh),Naganadel was 4-18-3-11 from 1st so 37 from 1,Dragonite 4-18-4-9 from 1st so 36 from 1 same and then finally Nivy(all laugh) Noivern was 4-18-4-7 was from 0th month(all laugh) so was thankfully at 33 from 0(all laugh) just that thought spared kids at own region(all laugh) Hoopa didn’t nor Aegislash(all laugh)...so by 40 all were done and then i was in the deep sea at undercover after 4 months(all laugh) when i came back each brat was jovial too much still i tested each and specially a few choised ones like Infernape and Luxray of course(all laugh) at Kalos and within 6-8 months i was absolutely assured that these are spoiled beyond infinite limits(all laugh) and in each life the normal period will decrease by a league(all laugh) ultimately running me out of profession(all laugh) but Giti was quickest(all laugh) 14 months done(all laugh) but Incineroar took 5(all laugh) i remember those brats as well in Kalos but not by order till today Trace told me(all laugh) and none was more than 11 and least was with Incineroar and that brat Dusknoir at 5(all laugh) 2-1-1-1 done(all laugh) i remember their months i can say Heatran 2-3-2-1 at 8(all laugh) Lycanroc(all laugh) she was something against Tyranitar cause Tyranitar’s time was like 18-36-18-never(all laugh) Lycanroc was 4-3-2-2(all laugh) was highest at 11(all laugh) and then Darkrai was 2-2-2-1 at 7(all laugh) was 7,Malamar was 2-1-2-1 at 6(all laugh) then Deoxys was 2-2-2-1 at 7(all laugh),Zygarde was 2-2-2-2 at 8(all laugh) not alone hence not so(all laugh),Greninja 3-2-2-2 at 9(all laugh) but she rejoined after 2 months being with me for two days before only and that brat Zeraora 3-2-1-1 at 7(all laugh) so i have the order i went there at 32,May;Lycanroc was 1st and all by themselves so 1st Lycanroc at 32,June spoiled at 33,May,sent to lab at 33,July(all laugh) then 2nd Darkrai(all laugh) at 32,August spoiled at 33,March,sent to lab at 33,May Gary and Lillie realized and soulmated each other on June next day Darkrai told Gary both your personal and professional life are veils in-between is you see for yourself(all burst into laughter) now after Gili to make him Nivy(all laugh) then 3rd Deoxys at 32,September,spoiled at 33,April,sent to lab at 33,June itself(all laugh) told Gary before confessing both she and you have stayed the same no matter what what’s the point confessing then(all burst into laughter)..remember something(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “two words(all laugh)..this pest asked me the same question before two words is proposal important(all laugh)..since the new translators to now THIS IS THE MOST HEINOUS PEST FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS IN THIS PROFESSING(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “AH!MR OAK SAID LIL CALL ME GARY BUT STILL OAK..(all burst into laughter)..any help sister(all burst into laughter)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “Mr Oak why is it called husband(all burst into laughter)..”
Gary(laugh) : “see this is hands-on example of this pest spoiling my wife while his wife was spoiled at the very first damn SCENE(all laugh)..at 16 surely flesh and blood ain’t it(all burst into laughter)..”
Misty(irritated,same pose-hugging Ash very firmly and resting her head on Ash’s chest,Ash bursts into laughter and hugs Mist quickly and the again back to same pose tendering her) : “SHUT UP!(all laugh)!you are the one who was infatuated at first sight with Lil and she the worse(all laugh)..my sweet bee..was(all laugh) in such danger and you namecall(all laugh)..Ash,cut this call(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “to namecall our Mist flower as toffee-flower(all laugh)..right(all laugh),so can continue(all laugh)..right(all laugh),so then 4th Malamar at 32,October,spoiled at 33,April,sent to lab at 33,June againt itself(all laugh) came along with Deoxys and told Gary before confessing and after you knew and know you’re Lillie so who are you and who is she then(all burst into laughter) then 5th Dusknoir at 32,October,spoiled at 33,March(all laugh),sent to lab at 33,May with Darkrai(all laugh),told Gary after confessing unless you can point out the exact moment when you realized the reality how can you say you’ve got it totally still(all burst into laughter) then this brat with Darkrai comes and next month Malamar with Deoxys(all laugh) Mr Oak Mr Oak had real memorably real time then(all laugh) then 6th Zeraora of course(all laugh) was at 33,February,spoiled at 33,September,sent to lab under the care of Mr Oak Mr Oak at 33,November(all laugh) then 7th Zygarde alone hence not(all laugh) she was at 33,March,spoiled at 33,November,sent to lab at 34,January then 8th Heatran of course(all laugh) what an experience inside volanic Heatran den(all laugh) this brat says mere kids there the idea of being is an attack of self thus what is an attack at all if it’s just the self illusion cause being itself is so by attacking the attack(all burst into laughter) Heatran was at 33,July,spoiled at 34,March sent to lab at 34,May two months before Kalos finals(all laugh) during finals one round was an utmost brat there(all laugh) then actually i thought Heatran will be my last but then Greninja first came at 33,April then was released at 33,June returned at 33,August again released at 33,September then again returned at 33,October so then she stayed and then 9th was Greninja i count at 33,October then she was spoiled at 34,June so during finals in July was a total brat(all laugh) but was sent here thus(all laugh) was the case of Hoopa who was spoiled the month before Unova finals began and Aigeslash during(all laugh) so was to be kept but i sent her here during the advanced group stages then by semi-finals returned to Kalos to me(all laugh) and then finally was sent here at 34,October after Unova Elite4 finished and infact Greninja came back first time and was already simmering with lunacy hence came back(all laugh) then released then again returned now absolutely boiling Mr Dycobs said from Fosmer-Kanrum-Haggler lab that this pest is impossible to control totally lunatic about you like your Mist flower(all laugh) so was back again and knew my brats so within 1 week got into battle starvation(all laugh) and then finally 10th Incineroar at 34,June actually Heatran came 33,July and this brat 11 months later(all laugh) and Greninja was at 33,October so still 8 months(all laugh) was a total surprize really but you know soulmates will come together no matter the psychophysical existence if that is same and the temporal scale permits(all laugh) infact my only experience with Incie alone and Lycie was with her who isn’t a psychic to being with who mederated Incie’s procedure(all laugh) and Incie was 4 day old(all laugh) so that was something and spent full 3 hours(all laugh) was bed ridden next day(all laugh) then next day went to a gym via Greninja infact couldn’t see clearly either(all laugh) was last  for the day there and said Greninja has to support me else i’ll fall in the battlefield and that was fire gym of course(all laugh) and then Mr Yugler still most in contact(all laugh) he just laughed said can i sit too(all laugh) i said well that is the best really(all laugh) then released Torterra,Shiftree(all laugh) and Ribombee(all laugh) all fooled around and then Mr Yugler said why don’t you stay here tonight i said yeah can barely walk anyway(all laugh) all of us stayed there and he was 52 then single and had great dishes made(all laugh)..so then Incineroar came at 34,June and was spoiled at 34,November(all laugh) was at Lab infact all the way since 33,August(all laugh) and was spoiled in 4 months here(all laugh) then was with me during Hoenn Elite4 as her test and by the time Hoenn finished i knew my full 107 is spoiled Chu and Mime is separate so the 107 was definitely done(all laugh) Chu too now fully done(all laugh) only Mime is good for best(all laugh) well not quite(all laugh) Mime has to keep the veil Chu was sweared out of(all laugh) Chu as you know picked up the art of battle starvation while he was kept here during undercover but wouldn’t use unless he knew he has to go to the grave(all laugh) so to save all of us he used to be but now he’s an utmost brat(all laugh) so from Kalos to Kanto i knew the result(all laugh) and that is still 4 out of 5(all laugh) final was Lance he declared barring 1st round just fun(all laugh) and got Stu in last round(all laugh) that was fun Stuart then said was dissapointed(all laugh) said still i got 1 that day now would’ve followed the law(all laugh) anyway then,Goodra,Rayquaza,Palkia,Hoopa thus joined and they found a hell to be put into(all laugh) and Nivy was chiding all dragons each day then Dragonite too became too powerful after like 2 weeks of chiding(all laugh) and Heracross threw him off each day(all laugh) MENTALLY(all laugh) and joined certain groups and so on but they were very jovial to human beings cause they realized that they are nothing to their powers(all laugh) and so on and each day i talked with thousand people(all laugh) to learn about these and my schedule was 10 hour training(all laugh) while at dreaded dragon inhibitations(all laugh) or at a disgracefully substandard gymhotel(all laugh) so i increased my training and talking time to 12(all laugh) rest 7 went in doing something out of which 6:30 were phonecalls(all laugh) it was just living inside a erupting volcano and slowly my personal life was getting affected then i just wanted to chill by having pokemon discussions(all laugh) at party’s and all which didn’t go down well and all and the whole world were telling me to calm down but Tyranitar would’ve killed each if i did(all laugh) then with my troubles i always was agitated and my disposition told the whole world that i’m a demon(all laugh) really whatever you saw here was nothing to that and during that final things became easier so i was calm(all laugh) and then finally Mist was scared and i then said it’s fine just my bunch is getting amusing powers i can’t tell you in words what i’m learing each hour with them,Mist was ever a little kid with me them and so many times i told her that please just calm down it will go eventually cause i can’t stay for eternity doing this maximum 3 years it can go on no more to which she was dissapointed but i was very sad as well and all were happening but you know my Mist just can’t think of her Ash for one moment thinking that she wasn’t his Mist or forgot her or didn’t think about her like that(Ash smiles at Misty,Misty smile at Ash and both in the same pose) and eventually she thought it was that pokemons were excuses and then way before that infact sent Glalie back to the lab to check it 10 days later Glalie came back and created a mayhem in the gym(all laugh) so Mist realized that it was about pokemons so then was alright for a few days but Glalie turned on Mist and Goldy one day and her powers flattened Goldy of all pokemons who in returned was rather shocked that Glalie who was so gentle in just 10 days would behave like that and then Glalie threatened Mist saying either she battles each day or will battle all present(all laugh) she actually returned and got Infernaped(all laugh) who was so incensed at everything and all then Glalie fought 1 battle and of course she couldn’t conncet to Mist or even me cause it was only 10 days but she totally decimated a rather very good opponet an one time champion(all laugh) without hearing one word of Mist and later turned on Golduck again saying you brat fight(all laugh) so then Goldy finally somehow managed to topple her cause she lost concentration in anger and was tired after fighting the whole gym then battling then again fighting(all laugh) so Mist sent her to the Lab that day itself at 23:30(all laugh) and Goldy was sent to the pokecentre and all who told Mist that Glalie’s friends have spoiled her(all laugh) but he wanted that too(all burst into laughter) and then to me and Glalie comes says i was in an asylum(all laugh) all behaves so goody-goody(all laugh) and with me for a month or a bit less may be and was extremely ferocious on everything then went back these all were going then my relationship with Mist broke down cause she was in the pinnacle of her fame with the show and the gym got that tag of speciality and all and then her life and mine were totally different when it came to our professional part cause i was in an environment where my bunched forced a red alert(all laugh) and she was so good in her skills that her bunch was extremely good but just pokemons(all laugh) mine became Tyranitar(all laugh) then of course Mist went there those who knew her greeted her saying are you here to battle(all laugh) and themselves divided in 10 groups(all laugh) and tld her to manage them each for and hour(all burst into laughter) by that time another 9 will be formed(all laugh) and the whole world were shocked to see this thing and i was as you know queried and all but i scoffed at pests saying none of your business and if i feel threatened i’ll straight inform the Elite4,Lance was ever in contact with me and he of course knew us since we were 20 and kept in touch and i told him just that my bunch is going to be really unique but pests are at me Lance said as long as you’re legal nothing can happen and my bunch was tasted i sent Tyranitar of course(all laugh) who fondled all so much they let him go comes back jumps on Abomasnow(all laugh) saying you brat should’ve been there cause none fought me(all laugh) where’s your beau(all laugh) to which Abomasnow said,he’s after you(al laugh) but that brat(all laugh) is no match for me lets fight(all laugh) and started their systems(all laugh) these all were going and then Mist was scared and told me to be careful cause of authority then those things were happening and all and then i just couldn’t stand anyone not talking about pokemons and told the same to Mist who was so shocked cried the first time which was a serious matter and that was the first time in both our lives together we had a serious issue in-between us that made one to cry and i didn’t feel bad about it then just told her don’t be so upset it’s ok we will talk about ourselves in between the lines(all laugh) and then all and then Mist totally got away from my head each weak thrice for half an hour 20 minutes in pokemon discussions then it became 15 minute call(all laugh) then all that by the time of that incident my bunch became much quite but i myself became Tyranitar then(all laugh) Mist at that time was so good herself like a 5 time champ that she just didn’t understand what was happening with my bunch and me and thought i was just going crazy i told only her that it’s they not me i’m forced to go hand in hand with them and all and then i recall even on the day of hell rounds Mist in illusion was that you’re jealous and you can’t battle legally from behind the responsibility mask that was the illusion and i first used the dark gang to shut her up(all laugh) then gave a long lecture saying Mist in next 1000 years many legends will come this bunch won’t so don’t try that trick with me of all people none in last 1000 can compete with me together if i only use Butterfree(all laugh) and the reason is Butterfree not me so i told her about the hard bits of undercover and all and then still after that she wanted to battle me cause my new girlfriend told..fine(all laugh),to delete the old which she did and i listened(all laugh)..my(all laugh) sweet flower(all smile)...right(all smile),that did happen then and i was so assured of Mist that i thought if i contacted her 1000 years later things will be same which is from current perspective but neither me nor she had that idea firmly ingrained then and Mist’s only demand is that she gets me for an hour just be with me or keep looking at me in silence i want that too but more abstract way Mist doesn’t want that abstraction and that was the trouble then so during that soulmate session i had to give my view and tell her to check hers and then we realized the bond clearly both but going back to Unova then i had ghosts around me(all laugh) and then my ghosts were around me afrter that in parties(all laugh) one day i had in the very end Spiritomb,Hoopa,Giratina,Mismagius,Aegislash and Confragigus(all laugh)...so those days went like that then i come back and all those afterwards go to undercover where atleast 7 were after me(all laugh) and very dangerous situations(all laugh) but by then i was battle hardened enough i said when death is everywhere why bother about PHYSICAL(all laugh) appearence i have no interest in personal discussions and if from opponent groups it was harded but was said i see how many has dumped you(all laugh) so those went on and then in the last 2 months all were extremely serious stuffs and all but in Unova i was there for 30 months excluding the final and first 8 were hard then next 18 were totally mad(all laugh) next 3 really my brats cooled a bit(all laugh) then the last month before finals they saturated their powers cause no new dragons came except Latios who got his treatment(all laugh) and finally then Unova final happens and all then we go undercover by then they were fed up battling(all laugh) and then eventually all went to Kalos where again all those  that came new and all they were sent after 2 weeks for battling among themselves(all laugh) and all then by Sinnoh Elite4 finals absolutely all did become jovial and then when i finished Hoenn Elite4 all were set totally being jovial and it took them i guess 8 years to complete the circle and they had their current form and all that is all of them became as they are now and then of course in the meantime Lapras,Primape,Butterfree and Pidgeot rejoined,Gengar was kept here for 1.5 months during our undercover training cause he needed to fight(all laugh) then he fought during team rocket too much(all laugh) then became too jovial(all laugh) then in the next 5 months he was kept here then we started the libraries Gengleye was a hit(all laugh) and Ultranercozma was kept here for an year full then that brat returned and pestered all(all laugh) and all these were happening and i got the eloquence then(all laugh) then in Unova some beautiful men wanted to know if i too were beautiful(all laugh) to which i said senors please i feel very depressed of myself with these(all laugh) and then after that tested a few of my bunch if they were soulmates or not(all laugh) and all were done by end Hoenn Elite4 and i also by the end of Kalos got the form that you saw return(all laugh) and then i went to Johto and all were still fine,Orange was pungent stuff but during last month in Kanto i was assured that Kukui lab being each of my bunch at the same time(all laugh) pass the next 1.25 years may be absolute atmost maximum then look for the next term and i then would’ve never been to Unova again and by now i wouldn’t have been here for sure had it not been for my Mist and you know the other side so anyway,lets return to the beautiful men,thus after one and half hours satisfying all being Team Rocket founder member(all laugh) i was in for another one and half(all laugh) cause the beautiful women didn’t want to hear the academic progress of the men(all laugh) thus then i’m confided in about all possible schools(all burst into laughter)...they give a huge list(all laugh) everything till then that wasn’t professional was foisted upon me(all laugh)..this takes more minutes and i see it’s 4 hours(all burst into laughter)..so i tell them look the coffee has got cold(all laugh)..supplimented with snacks given(all laugh) not enough it’s 4 i came at 12:00(all burst into laughter) from Venturiastrog to Lumburg HQ at 4:10 hours(all laugh)..then anyway the food is excellent though in lunch(laugh) anyway so after lunch coffee is 1.5 hours around(all laugh)..but as i try to rush men say wait(all burst into laughter)..i realized Cili has Katched Ketchum(all laugh)..Cili(all laugh)..sorry just can’t desist(all laugh)..but(all laugh) i guess we’ll have to stop here today cause ghosts are jumping(all laugh) so bye(all reciprocate bye)...”

David(laugh) : “well,our trap was grand(all laugh),so then in the morning Gary comes and i greet him saying,from authority to check(all laugh) and then went on a bit and he was grave and then i just laughed and said everything he was overjoyed and then in that 2/3 hours itself realized he’s my big bro for eternity as well(all laugh) and then Trace came after that and then another 2 hours and then Gary returned and by then my elder sisters were jumping up and down as well(all laugh) then bro actually fetched Dragonite and sent Gengleye off with Greninja and Dragonite came alone wasn’t happy as usual at all that his evolutionary methods were being disturbed since the day before(all laugh) then bro just said just teach Scyther(all laugh) so they were there and then Rayquaza came with Latios and Ultranercozma(all laugh) so he and Dragonite was sent back both are sworn in enemies of course(all laugh) and then Latios was kept with Ultranercozma to abduct Brock during lunch first time(all laugh) then he comes and was as usual too nice(all laugh) and then i finally video call May and then bro introduce us and all till 4:30 went on then Trace and bro went back,Brock stayed cause his matters were hard to sort out but bro was too happy to have any patience that day which his pests liked but the unknown signals that insinuated seriousness they didn’t agree with at all(all laugh) then again Brock was reabducted again at 21:00(all laugh) then i was in video call with my elder sisters before the next day,next day all together that gathering at lab is really memorable and the night before meeting aunty and all we both were too happy to have found our full family again and i was really happy to have my parents in a sense again(all smile) and then i told uncle,aunty and Luc before that i want to stay with my bro and they you know said yeah kid that laugh(all laugh) and then bro told aunty that a deal you get out of home i give you my little bro and sis-in-law literally(all laugh) and to dad being at lab with you he gets his nephew and niece-in-law Gary and Lillie so Yveltal asks are you happy(all laugh) aunty was first too overjoyed already to have me and Zara here then going to lab and all were so emotional but as usual Yveltal comes up(all laugh) so later told us Dave won't this pest for once let the translators off(all laugh) see even made me call my own son a pest(all laugh,Ash cheers for Gengar,all laugh)..man,Gengarian philosophy is something for sure(all laugh) no wonder Wendy is ever miffed with bro(all laugh)and then she was told in brief and then was dealt again(all laugh) Bulbasaur was sent to introduce me and Zara(all laugh) and he said these two chosen brats are infatuated with master brat cause they don’t know the relation between mental prognosis of abstract ideas(all burst into laughter) somehow managed to shove Raichu down his throat(all laugh) but he kept disturbing within and hence was so funny the thing(all laugh) then bro before told everything in brief and all discuss and then next day was so great Daisy and Lillie was namecalling me all the way two days back then just brositted me to absolute limitless(all laugh) and Brock was again abducted in later half(all laugh) then May and Drew was there for 3 hours at video(all laugh) and then Boulder of course(all laugh) then the 8 musketiers of Cerulian(all laugh) actually  then finally Cili(all laugh) and also Max and Mr and Mrs Maple were there all was just such a overwhelming experience of joy for both of us and then all the plan but the luck is such next day Team Rocket Real had to create red alert at Unova(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “AH!UNOVA!CILIVA!(all laugh)..no,no finsih it’s alright here and later there i was with Zekrom(all laugh) and yeah Giti to add(all laugh)..”
David(laugh) : “well,the first month was alright then Jasu arose(all laugh) and here we were most dejected all my sisters here and brothers too that more cause of that bunch was not here at all except Chu and Mime and they were rather serious then did fool around but wasn’t what they normally are,Mime was extremely serious,Chu was still jovial and extremely overprotective of sis(all laugh) then after Bulbasaur and Muk returned all were much happier and the 4 were much jovial then and Bulbasaur told me substandard food as usual that master brat never learns(all laugh) and Muk said only a hug away just don’t understand the spontaneity of changing emotional feelings blinking across beings waiting to be hugged to be not serious again at all(all burst into laughter)...then they got our mood way lighter in a way,then bro went in December that month was fine next month Lance said hard stuff don’t know whether i can hold my post and Trevor of all people was a bit shaky and then i had to return there and Zara said you go to hell but remember you will return here only(all laugh) i was surprized but so so happy infact(all laugh) and mom and dad knew about Oak Labs by then all did(all laugh) and they too much(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “just an eloquent intervention(all laugh),Zara was at personal care of..”
All in Unison,except David and Gary(laugh) : “AH!PROFESSIONALITY DAVE,THIS IS MR OAK!(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “yeah,yeah,i get it all a ploy to dethorn me(all laugh)..yeah that’s in lexicon too(all burst into laughter)..”
David(laugh) : “no really Gary,you,Trace and Brock are as much as bro is in contribution to unleashing these pests(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “yeah,to our utmost misfortune(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “well,my family too i guess(all laugh)..and this pest has spoiled Foster as well you know(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) :”personally(all laugh)..”
David(laugh) : “no Foster is some pest indeed(all laugh)..i asked him a few days ago next year the first nomination but you’ve already been granted so take care of Flores more now(all laugh),yeah David but still Regirock has a trouble in left 3rd hand stone at a that level(all burst into laughter)..i said yeah,even i have to sympathize with your wife more(all laugh)..anyway,so i went back to Sinnoh at new year and first month there was alright still but here the troubles started and then the next month Bulbasaur and Muk returns too jovial we knew bro was here atleast and then their disposition as ever suggested girlfriend wasn’t of their expected type at all(all laugh)..so,atleast we knew it’s as usual the humans that were the threats and then from the next month itself in March the troubles started Lance was forced out in March itself who was bro’s biggest support,this got Trevor roused up suddenly and then from April Jasu came forth(all laugh) and then McShin of all people came in May and Tlplocus was trouble in May and then sis was even in that condition suddenly summoned and she was totally in vacation not even in practise and still on,i by then realized Trevor had lost his mind and persy all over the place and suddenly Emely at Orange became too greedy and so i was throwing around my weight and still you know later Brock was allowed to Orange but i should’ve been there as well cause Kommo-O at full rage is a sight to watch(all laugh) not at all safe for even me though(all laugh) then my Sinnoh hazards were off and during bro’s recovery there pests were playing there games everywhere when Guzzlord came to massive help everywhere(all laugh)..really he returned and we all told Bulbasaur to let him loose with the philosophy 4,Palkia was last with the rest and Feraligator was playing Crawdaunt’s role as well and once Bulbasaur was jovial those pests went to absolute maxima(all laugh) and turned the table everywhere for us(all laugh),Lenny everyday used to to tell Zara these are the line and she said no cases will be not not won by us decimating everyone(all laugh) so yeah the translators were immense and no wonder only Trace could provide those along with how he handled everything here all alone and all cause of what Trace(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “OH!SO GLORIOUS(all laugh)!..no man,that day that hour at this brat’s very own den was something(all laugh),this pest went off shoving me down the most difficult responsibility of 1000ft emotional management of his lunatic Gyarados without looking at her(all laugh) and that was the toughest time really and then Jas and Blosie was also getting closer to come here and so on so somehow managed but,yeah the traslators needed to be better so i concentrated cause we weren’t sure of anything and then when Bulbasaur returned and Muk of course(all laugh) then everything was easier but man those lines from Guzzlord and all the brats combined was something(all laugh) but had master brat not been injured we would’ve seen real fireworks at Huntelion itself(all laugh)..”
David(laugh) : “yeah,Cili feared that exactly when jasu and McShin was after him and especially after dragging Lance bro for once said i can get a Kommo-O if i stay there for 7 days continous and then will see what these brats can do about it when using that with my bunch full Huntelion becomes madcaps in tickling(all laugh)..anyway,then bro was back and by then Jasu was down with McShin and bro returned and within the very first month all were too fine cause all are afraid of Huntelion now(all laugh) infact a broad might be there prohibitting bro from entering(all laugh) and also if these pests are forsaken now then whole Kanto will get spoiled(all laugh) so McShin can’t do a thing and then his Cerulian family scoffed at him severely saying our name has already been in floklores don’t spoil it(all laugh)..so,anyway,then back in Unova legaue then after first two months of fake newses that he is entering and then the extra tests,bro is personally checked alongside his bunch next month he announced he was humiliated so is entering none can stop him(all laugh) then gave a false nomination(all laugh) then Unova said no he has changed his heart(all laugh) then next month was 4th when Unova said his bunch will be rechecked more was said(all laugh) next month was the final finally 5(all laugh) all 6+ and male 5+ with one league left were banned unless it was their 7th month(all laugh) in that case females spared cause they may have to discontinue if maternal leave comes(all laugh)...but we weren’t unbiasedly lucky(all laugh) and that is the i guess only league where all were 5+(all laugh) except exactly bro(all laugh) some 5+ revolted without knowing the Shiftree methods which he today a few hours ago told my poor Manaphy the idea of invoking a revolution from within to mitigate the revolution of the idea of the same(all burst into laughter) sadly they didn’t know how to achieve that(all laugh) and they were scoffed off saying they will be given 3 years in Unova again and didn’t have to complete their last region with minimum number of hall of fames and badges with another 3 months for their personal life(all laugh) but will have to face Elite4 twice in 26 months to win it at 12-2 atleast(all laugh) to get even the general tag(all laugh) and 13-1 will get them the hall of fame but Lance,Trevor and Persy will be freed up of their duties for the next 6 years(all laugh) and Lance will continue beyond 65(all laugh) and also then there are qualification rules as you know number of wins against hall of famers in gym and general training and so on(all laugh) these too were made impossible and so it enough for everyone to say we’re not Shiftree so pardon us(all laugh) and if any tried to show personal reasons their whole family was grilled(all laugh) and Unova region pokemons including all psudeo-legends were suspended for next league(all laugh) and Unovan dragons will would’ve been suspended for Elite4 as well where one faces Lance’s 5 dragons to none(all laugh) so many sanctions if they didn’t want to face bro(all laugh) i was rather curious as to why this sudden fanatism(all laugh) and you know whole world knew Tyranitar asked the researchers whoose whoose beau a few chosen brats sneaked away beyond the like gysopmoftif-protoradon-neurobulm-synaratom reverse dark-prosomoic mask last hour bring each brat immediately along with their choised beaus(all laugh) that type specification meant everyone said that please we have responsibities(all laugh) and that i still remember cause they said it’s like 10 Mewtwos in one(all laugh) but now just a max best normal Ghostradarkarrigussonor(all laugh) Munro then after that all said life is but a dream so forget we ever competed in Unova league(all laugh) and Trevor along with other Elite4 heads and Team Rocket boss himself knew that if bro agrees it’s a matter of weeks to get the job done(all laugh) and i along with certainly Jasu and McShin then thought the opposite(all laugh) and then i got bro in first round itself(all laugh) you know Luc knows everything said like show the brat(all laugh) i said yeah if i can sneak behind the differentiating of reactions to appearing feelings of joy in 4th quarter from the cause fully comprehended hallucination mask(all laugh) this bro said first time when he told me about his questioning traing sessions(all laugh) so anyway then i get him and my line up was Palkia(all laugh) who was asked how to know that he has a tail(all burst into laughter) the process was by not knowing one feels the knowledge is inbuilt(all burst into laughter) hence one knows one by not knowing the other if i am known by me where is the other(all burst into laughter) then Butterfree offcourse(all laugh) added this means if a Palkia is a Butterfree then he can sleep power too by knowing it but then agaiin he can’t cause that knowledge of feeling is different(all burst into laughter) so those two pests taught this and my Palkia returns and tells me life is hard(all laugh) i said yeah only the beginning(all laugh),Tapu Koko,Zygarde(all laugh) who made my bunch lonely(all laugh),Groudon,Latios(all laugh) my ground types are too confused now to my utmost benevolence in matches(all laugh) cause they repeat these things(all laugh),Kommo-O(all laugh) the sensei(all laugh),Ultranercozma(all laugh) her knowledge is great against any opponents(all laugh),Zeraora(all laugh) Gary specialist(all laugh) this is real fun in battles now(all laugh) the right approach to questions(all laugh),Giratina(all laugh) just that(all laugh) and finally Tyranitar(all laugh) sneaking behind masks(all laugh) and bro choses Feraligator,Crawdaunt(all laugh) who was against Tapu Koko 1 dark psybeam and Tapu Koko was 2/3 hours in pokecentre immediately sent(all laugh) and this was after she thunder-chaired which couldn’t break the dark guard and then at the same time the dark beam come 2 minutes done(all laugh) and Crawdaunt zapped to bro and ate up his cap he had a reserve one smiled and put it up(all laugh) i understood these two are swelled up by the two most loathed villians then Mr Tracey Skechit junior villian and Mr Gary Oak most cunning senior villian(all laugh) and Professor was playing the tunes(all laugh) then of course bro announced whom he will use obviously before the match and chose first of course(all laugh) and yeah each was 10 on 10 as you know whoever bro faced in groups they said first will be 10 in groups then 12 in 32nd and 14 in 16th round then quarter final 16 and semi final and final it will be 20(all laugh) bro will do the normal rule(all laugh) bro said no such thing will take place if they want to keep the battlefield intact after each of his matches cause Tyranitar,Dialga,Solgaleo etc will dance upon the whole place after each match together(all laugh) they said alright we have to be serious outside of professional responsibilities(all laugh) so bro had 94 then including Lapras,Pidgeot,Butterfree,Primape barring Mime of course and he then used 40+32+20 total 92 barring Butterfree of course he wasn’t there then and of course Sharpedo he never used anywhere and then i had Zygarde(all laugh) against Garchomp who was in full lunacy then just may be 6 months old(all laugh) but still wasn’t like the preceeding two who settled down by then so some battle was there but Garchomp just were too extremely powerful so easily decimates Zygarde to 2 hour pokecentre(all laugh) then next Groudon faces Guzzlord(all laugh) same result but Guzzlord having come earlier was more incensed than Garchomp so 4 hour pokecentre(all laugh) then Latios against Zekrom(all laugh) and Zekrom was absolutely lunatic then so eats Latios up totally(all laugh) finally goes in Kommo-O(all laugh) now i saw bro was smiling broadly cause it’s sensei(all laugh) then saluted me and Kommo-O most(all laugh) i thought yeah want to steal this one as well now(all laugh) then Kommo-O is against Hydreigon then same result 3 hour pokecentre and it was 5 wins for him i felt relieved now that i’m heading towards the last half now finally(all laugh) then Ultranercozma is against Kyurem(all laugh) same stuff 3 or 4 hour pokecentre infact Garchomp was some battle rest just overwhelmed by bunch and thus only Garchomp had the unfortunate tage of sending brats off to hospital for only 2 hours(all laugh) then Zeraora(all laugh) really Gary has no peace of mind(all laugh)..anyhow then agaist Zeraora it’s Naganadel(all laugh) and i was hopeful that may be atleast one to equal McShin(all laugh) but Naganadel was so quick and the posion attack so dangerous nothing happened at all and then Poison beam stuff Zeraora 4 hours off(all laugh) so McShin seemed a real role model(all laugh) then i chose Giratina(all laugh) and i was happy cause the match was 80% done(all laugh) and Dialga came i thought atleast this one(all laugh) nothing happens,one sword charge finally and Giratina is torn apart(all laugh) 4 hours pokecentre and each jumped bro saying all substandard not girlfriend(all laugh) and then finally i said well Tyranitar go(all laugh) and bro laughed seeing a Tyranitar and bowed down to him cause that’s bro’s helpline contact(all laugh) then saulted me and ref and all(all laugh) and he had Reshiram(all laugh) Tyranitar can’t take flamethrow from budding Dispoptas’(all laugh) so 3 hours off then match ends he shake hands i was loathing him(all la ugh) then spoke later just formal talks realized he knows a lot so must be a good illegal(all laugh) saw his Chu equally incensed that he wasn’t given each brat(all laugh) bro just said it’s all luck just his bunch too good which affirmed my belief that just patronizing utmost crook(all laugh) but well this word is something(all laugh)...”
Violet(laugh) : “that gym,the family(all laugh),that idea,the BOULDER(all laugh),that dish(all laugh),that FEELING(all laugh) and finally THE MAN(all laugh)...”
All in unison except Brock and David,Misty angry voice a bit,Ash laughs and hugs her firmly(laugh) : “IT’S JUST SO NAIVE(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “yeah now little bro also has joined in that FEELING(all laughter)..”
David(laugh) : “well feels nice(all laugh),and please Violet your experience of that match(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “well i watched the Orange match all of us did and Hoenn but sadly with Mist Ketchum then the after match first talk too to my utmost inconvenience(all laugh) and then finally this one,Orange we said hmm..toffee-flower..hmm(all laugh)..sure whole world knows it right(all laugh)..”
David(laugh) : “well,only if my sis allows me to know(all laugh)..”
Misty(frown,same pose,Ash laughs) : “no Dave don’t listen to these namecalls(all laugh)..”
David(laugh) : “so i’m silently allowed(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “Ash please that bit cause too much time(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “Professor Mr Oak Dr Oak(all laugh) interprets the elder sisters’ reactions..hmm..doesn’t change pokemons..hmm..(all laugh)..too much ego..hmm..(all laugh)..because the bench..hmm..(all laugh)..still wins with a damn brat Muk and for the bench..hmm...(all laugh)..hmm..Ashey-boy..hmm..(all laugh)..pokemon master..hmm...catches pokemons..hmm..(all laugh)..then trains them..hmm..(all laugh)..then wins toffee-flower..hmm..(all laugh)..of all places had to be Cerulian..hmm..(all laugh)..Waterflower..hmm..(all laugh)..and raided our gym..hmm..(all laugh)..and our baby sis is too infatuated with this brat..hmm..(all laugh)..hm..Ashey-boy..hmm..pokemon master..hmm...(all laugh)..we will see how she gets her way once she returns..(all laugh)..and hence she went to my home FOR ONE FULL MONTH(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “yeah,that was something and we thought now no way you two will return not married(all laugh) so we hear Mist going to your home we said when did you get married(all laugh) said never in a million years(all laugh) but my Ash..um..(all laugh)..just my best friend(all laugh)..team rocket surely told you that line..(all laugh)..”
David(laugh) : “yeah even before i met bro after Unova to begin with(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “just so naive(all laugh) then we knew this pest is too dense of course so may be will get atleast 3 for sure(all laugh) and then i wateched live the Hoenn final when i said greatest caring husband(all laugh) and Unova said the opposite(all laugh) and then Kalos all watched(all laugh) and i said just that age(all laugh) and then i knew about the gatefees(all laugh) and all were driven here as you know(all laugh) and even in my field he was a centre of attraction but all said just as a Gengar(all laugh)..anyway,that was my experience(all laugh)..
David(laugh) : “well,Gengarian life now whole Orange has come to admire at gunpoint though(all laugh) cause it’s with Palkian lifestyle(all laugh)..anyhow before continuing bro really i mean for all the family that we are now what were your views of the undercover cause you were the centre of attention of even the Unova general government(all laugh) so that view of yours before the seprate room living started for you and my sis-in-law(all laugh)..”
Ash(smile) : “well i really didn’t bother at all you know and we did the final knail stuff really so many were chosen brats(all laugh) and i really didn’t care i knew James and Jesse weren’t exactly what they wanted to be(all laugh) cause you all know the bunch(all laugh) and Meowth(all laugh) then in Unova they met me thrice full gang did first time sadly i had Tyranitar himself(all laugh) and Metagross(all laugh) with Infernape mad version(all laugh) he was something in that phase(all laugh) so 10 were thrown into the bay and next time the typical sneak attack on Chu but it was Zapdos then(all laugh) and normally trained so no chance with 5(all laugh) and i knew they will fondle me so kept Rotom(all laugh) and that was enough for them then final time they tried the sabotage stuff by bribing labs(all laugh) but really i was physically scared and for my bunch as well and also for Cili and Iris and i had Celebi and Claydol who had been from Orange and Johto was with me for 10/12 years so barely managed them from not sending them with other culprits along with their bunch to next life(all laugh) and it was possible cause they were with me that long never if it was Uxie and Bronzong(all laugh) just those set up labs as you know but i was familier with them too much by then(all laugh) and then after that you know Meowth was misbehaving cause he surely realized what power my bunch pocessed and may be now they will attack human beings as well cause they were trained to that extent he understood that was at the level of their Mewtwo but way more powerful and Mewtwo did try to fondle human beings against orders so he alerted them by misbehaving cause himsef was too afraid(all laugh) and managing Meowth was a big thing really still is though as whole world has to find their beau immediately or get abjectly scratched(all laugh) so then yeah i was like you know my bunch then(all laugh) by the time i went in Luxray surely was a Lightenthunstorm but this jovial self also was there and you know my psychics then(all laugh) that was actually more frightening cause so many years of battle nature peeked in their minds from time to time otherwise you know Dave would’ve taken a week to settle down(all laugh) just imagine Giraora with the greatest boss(all laugh) what means a comrade and why they are so starkly different(all laugh) so anyway,i was like if they ask me i may think cause i knew unless one goes deep no physical harm so i was alright and then i was thinking that well i’ll marry Mist and then tell her and then go may be in similar situation as to the Unova one but this time you know i now think way better protection whole world Elite4 would’ve given to all of you and even inside i would’ve asked for more people in handling those stuffs which we were warned but just laughed off then even James many times cautioned us but we were we just that wasn’t our life and thus they would’ve provided atleast two more personnel cause being married i wasn’t alone like i was when i did go there so yeah i would’ve been there cause i knew my bunch was like that and Unova same reason why i went a person like () and that calamity for him this term it really told me that this is serious and the gym leaders as you know asked me to come after that Mrs Jolum,Mrs Olympia,Mr Graham from Opelucid Jasu(all laugh) they surely they did but still did tell me don’t get involved with anyone except psychics but anyway to be honest whatever happened happened and the result it’s like a plane journey sometimes the crash landing gives you great injuries but the aftermath with Jasu(all laugh) that would’ve never been there really..so yeah i would’ve been there for sure but then i broke-up and just jumped in after James boy confessed his longing for both his beau and me(all laugh)..”
David(laugh) : “well some confession that was to his beau(all laugh) May likes that cost(all laugh) anyway, then bro did agree and the whole reason why he wasn’t attacked more vigourously later before that fake lab stuff that was 12 or 13 months before the finals i guess bro said just after or before getting Guzzlord and the reson for that not happening again or the pokemon attacks was that he was totally legal and meant his bunch are too cunning like Mewtwo and Acreus not togethre catching cause they were wild(all laugh) and then most dangerously he couldn’t be stopped as he will get another set and in 2/3 years will become the same this time having a Kommo-O(all laugh) cause he will start from Cosmog,Corpish,Totodile,Larvitar and Jangomo-O(all laugh) within 9 months they will become who they are now with 50 more recruits(all laugh) and then mostly if he or his close ones are physically harmed the general government will finally get involved across all regions(all laugh) and they were anyway alarmed after bro complained that fake labs are here as well then what about gyms so may i take care of them(all laugh) and that was it(all laugh) so our beloved rocket lesser bought the opportunity to insinuate his name(all laugh) anyway i say fine but am i allowed to meet the longing confessor or atleast know the gender(all laugh) says yeah they want too(all laugh) i think great whole family involved(all laugh) then i meet the lesser rocket who was finally honest to himself but i asked him about his legal bunch first says Confragigus(all laugh) i say enough(all laugh) he’s dissapointed says no the Garchomp i carry really loves me(all laugh) anyway i realized after he showed his bunch that they were fondling them to that irreversible extent(all laugh) so i understand their plight against bro and all(all laugh) and then anyway says a bit about bro and why trusts him i was thinking of course too much bonhomie(all laugh) then finally bro comes in and then after half an hour of chatting i realize why Feraligator could beat 50 Palkias(all laugh) cause he was in his own opinions(all laugh) DANCING TO THAT MADDENING TUNE(all burst into laughter) and it was as we all know the mind games that worked(all laugh) there aginst me as well though those were said while they were attacking(all laugh) and Zygarde was sweared left and right cause Garchomp had to break a bit of sweat(all laugh) and then anyway,the wills are made so that the poverty line may go up in each region barring Sinnoh including Kalos obviously(all laugh) and then our hands on training where he showed us the difference between real and unreal bodyslam(all laugh) and saw his Palkia knew what a choised one that is(all laugh) so i realized that he alone was 50(all laugh) so we’re safe and can go anywhere cause we had total 70(all laugh) and that meant 3500 about 1.5 times more against 1898(all laugh) i rather need to look after him cause he at that time was like very nice but if poked will become Reshiram(all laugh) and during undercover all were scoffed off as being men or women(all laugh) and the rocket duo loved this exact bit so much(all laugh) later impersonally told me just Mistyfied about it(all laugh) but i was ever spared and given license to fondle him cause since beginning we both felt that closure and then after me and Zara realized we are soulmates he was too happy but first you know under which circumstances all these were happening and then secondly though Zara was fortunate enough to then be in the process which as we know is too uneven(all laugh) and i still was not bro(all laugh) so she was saved and so was i(all laugh) and you know that time was devastating for bro personally and yeah i faced that stuff as well for 3 months constant which was devastating as well as the others did the same and felt the same but you know my side and Zara’s too and bro faced the most of that we never to that extent none of us except him but like me bro as well found Misty later in the real light so for both of us and Zara as well that part has been illusive now for long(all smile) so anyway,then just before the final a week or so to before tells me about my biggest curiosity cause i realized that he was too caring about everyone and such nature must have been properly attacked(all laugh) but surely he understands two people and their relation in matter of minutes and happy and sad according to his own views about it but surely must have a chink in the sheild(all laugh) then i realize the chink actually was so big it made the shield useless(all laugh) he told me about Misty and said just call at 6:30 and if match hasn’t finished then say very urgent and will call back after a certain point of time then say if the sad news happened the logic is and i instantly understood that 15 years was so hard to forget(all laugh) ‘no Mist i mean(all laugh) Misty was ever vulnerable emotionally just after the gym time finished cause of the pestering she received and all always told me about this big pressure  from such a young age hard on a little girl very hard anyway(all laugh) so then if she has moved on she’ll officially complain against you(all burst into laughter) and if not you’ll see a burst of lots of emotions,i said well i will see but complain(All laugh)..no will namecall Zara(all laugh) and then you and then say you’re not a man then drag Zara in it(all laugh) and so on so i understood similar stubborness(all laugh) and then afterwards Crawdauntogator did what they do(all laugh) and some battle that was cause i was just around(all laugh) the funniest bit i remember was finally when intruders got upto them(all laugh) Crawdaunt said like comrade replan to fetch uneuqal beaus(all burst into laughter) to which Feraligator said then drag the humans after all they are the choised ones that are playing the music(all burst into laughter) then most astonishingly they went to that next level that is there current as no matter what the humans did became a plan to oppose their bonds in combinations(all laugh) and the humans were told about this before yet failed to match pokemon intelligence(all laugh) this was to me the biggest honesty of dishonesty(all laugh) then finally Azelf is Uxied(all laugh) and Marshadow,Banette and Sableye gets the boss to tickle them after getting the remote and undressing him(all laugh) while a herd of psychics and ghosts covered us with incredible antics(all laugh) and that was it for the boss and we go out and the whole time in there he shielded me most in battle as if i’m a little baby(all laugh) cause told me that you’re a great professional like your bunch but just not mad that is a little sweet kid like Lance or Trevor(all laugh) and later i just looked after our group including him cause he had Tyranmadgaleoredveltal(all laugh) so it was all right and not to mention Garchomp and Zekrom and inneumerable dragons and ghosts(all laugh) and he took each dual type there here only by the end had just 10 excluding Mime and Chu(all laugh) all those could breed were spared and had Muk,Lapras,Sharpedo,Pidgeot and Primape out of whom Lapras,Pidgeot and Primape had just came back for permanent stay after getting battle tune maddened(all laugh) so wasn’t at that level just about started battling(all laugh) and Muk isn’t ever taken except the Unova one still was sent back but Bulbasaur was there though all time and with me he was cause he was calm and cool(all laugh) but in battles i just let him off and was an absolute pest against all fire types(all laugh) and finally we go out in that fashion and then we were very good friends still after that he gave what he could to the lab here and also to Professor Kukui used whole ego to shield us and so on but the press has been lucky that he wasn’t eloquent then cause the things we saw there if were lectured upon(all laugh) anyway that was like a family bond but like second cousins(all laugh) then he went to Kalos and me Kanto and i realized with his antics and all(all laugh) that he’s at a level from where a wife if directly found will be able to control(all laugh) but we had professional contacts talking about legends(all laugh) cause we both were 5 time champs and battle hardened too much(all laugh) and then eventually we realized the brotherhood just after he finished that Kalos tour and laughed all off but that unfortunate incident happened for which i feel very bad for him and Misty and all of us as well but still i only sympathize with the family(all laugh) and then one day wasn’t in mood was talking about legends and how their independent herd mentality he sees among people(all laugh) then i said what happened then said those and all then during Elite4 we became bros during Kalos where i realized that he will die soon if he becomes a Gengar(all laugh) and people were saying he’s a Gengar(all laugh) who was constantly with him along with Sableye or other ghosts to help the process(all laugh) and Giratina to find out the differences for Hoopa to mean them and so on(all laugh) and then we in Kalos itself came that press bro vs beau differentiation(all laugh) we knew there’s no girl for him more than him(all laugh) actually i confronted him after this cause first we got his internal pain and as i said i realized too much ghostly bonhomie(all laugh) and then next time i see him was laughing so much said what else now no hazards of stunts and so on with my bunch step by step really you know nothing left to be done for me in human world atleast given what i could i did the rest what i want will be not here but with my buddies only who are real atleast to me then i couldn’t take it and screamed at him confronting that atleast me and Zara don’t think you’ve done everything here we want you with us atleast you’re like our family to which he said look will you be able to stop even your very own big bro if he’s eating Gengar’s food whole day mentaly even while you forcefeed him human food(all laugh) so i realized the bond and his views and my sudden words as well really we were brothers and so on and i was dissapointed after all these cause no matter our realization he himself drew a line in the horizon which was so painful for both me and Zara then yet he said just get the tag i’m not going anywhere till my mom is secured and the lab and all it’ll take some years atleast 3 for sure and then went about our future and so on so that was really emotional for me but again that was Persy and these all got me charged up as to i must beat each brat i see cause they created this profession else Gengars would’ve been roaming around in their own dens not ours(all laugh) and then each hall of fames and so on i met afterwards whom i thought was good enough to say the thing i said try to atleast get him engaged in some activities involving good research or campaigns about legends(all laugh) and both me and Zara kept a tab on him and we were given great life lessons(all laugh) i was told to obviously keep protection and learn anatomy(all laugh) and concentrate on lessons i learnt form long battles and all emotions help in family life if properly managed(all laugh) and yeah like take a minute more to brush my teeth well(all laugh) and so on but Zara was told to prolong the lunch break by 7 minutes by scoffing off only but absolutely the rule makers cause they do(all laugh) so she was told to walk for 5 minutes after lunch but while the breathing process must be slow to help the digestion so walk slowly(all burst into laughter) cause else in late hours may come acidity(all burst into laugter) and she was treated as 5 year old kid at first month in school alone(all laugh) and so on then we both were reminded that we should never forget to keep track on minute details like if on a day the dinner was taken 5 minutes later due to things that could’ve been postponed like tv or night training(all laugh) and all sorts of stuffs like asking if the vitamins were taken enough or not and the side effects of much time in the sun on AC and so on(all laugh) these all was cause if time is taken as discretely being presented then each passing moment the joy becomes less and sorrw the opposite but if continuous then everything is same and to keep it continuous a personal most dear hold must be there which is one’s soulmate(all laugh) and this way the psychophysicality is also assimilated to time thus the flowing will get flowed out the rest remains thus the consequent result of happier life(all laugh) and we get this logic are were dumbfounded that either he will stay single forever or married forever(all laugh) and we knew about Misty then so we realized must’ve been forever married now a bad patch(all laugh) and i battled Misty and no in that time you can’t understand anything and that was not in the last year but i got an idea that she wasn’t happy atleast cause i intentionally asked for professional contacts she just refused by politing it out(all laugh) so i realized was not ok at all cause she was extremely good but not hall of fame for like ages cause i was 5 time champ with the name and all(all laugh) so rather it was for her benefit more than mine to be honest(all laugh) so we knew that atleast then Misty didn’t have a happy personal life(all laugh) but with all these care and logic Zara says that Dave,we can by no means keep him at home cause that kind of care surely for this only those ghosts has conspired against Misty(all laugh) i said despite my profession i must agree cause those are hardly pokemons(all laugh) and more so cause the 10 that came from Kalos in notime was spoiled and Incineroar the most(all laugh) and here bro too agrees as we all do that yeah my bunch or any trainer’s bunch is accused once they are 4+ with 2+ left(all laugh) but his bunch is the most accused one directly telling him what to do by literal lines(all laugh) and it’s true(all laugh) yeah i know the stories how everything is judged by pokemons i actually became a bro cause first Utranercozma came(all laugh) and then Kalos bunch took notime to get spoiled Incineroar the epitome of that so i became bro and Zara for same reason became sis(all laugh) after my Cerulian badge the 2nd last in Kanto afetr Viridian and the last was Pewter cause i wanted to follow him opposite way(all laugh) i told him and he always asked about the opposition and so on as he was being fed substandard food at 230 grand hotels and 72 motels(all laugh) but this time said rather said yeah be brief that’s the worst of the 3(all laugh) Daisy Waterflower was way better cause not a star(all laugh) and then again what else that so and so Gyarados(all laugh) i said no Golduck,Jellicent,Sharpedo(all laugh) against Palkia(all laugh) but Palkia went down to Jellicent in a draw cause Golduck was too good if not Jellicent(all laugh) then went with Kyogre(all laugh) who went down to Sharpedo(all laugh) and i knew how good Misty was and why the name is necessary(all laugh) then i realized still heart wrenching(all laugh) said Sharpedo afterwards was one punch away(all laugh) so i went with Feraligator(all burst into laughter) no that name now is something really everywhere(all laugh) entering general dictionary for sure as Gengar already is there(all laugh) and no it didn’t take short(all laugh) but man Palkia and Kyogre couldn’t...just your petulance seeing the Golduck..Feraligator should’ve been first to cunningly get the brat lulled(all laugh) then Dragons would’ve decimated the brat cause Golducks are naturally happy going bunch and Palkias are best lie detectors(all laugh) so that brat couldn’t fool him saying i want to battle till death cause he doesn’t(all burst into laughter) then Jellicent should’ve been given water sentiment not psychic or dragon cause that brat is chill and cool in thought of play(all laugh) so feed him exactly that and make him happy then prey upon him(all laugh) again detect the lie(all laugh) and only that will puzzle the brat to submit himself as to how his playing tricks are needed to be less responsible(all burst into laughter) a trick each time would get any gym leader toppled cause otherwise you can’t keep a Jellicent in a gym(all burst into laughter) though my Jellicent knows of thousand other methods to fool the whole world both way but none are responsible(all laugh) cause they don’t know what it means(all laugh) thus the gym leader should’nt either or else they’ll teach the lesson(all laugh) yet mine can be responsible too showing irresponsibility and the viseversa(all laugh) and this fooling around saves your energy for the last incessesant one whoose medicine is to tell him you can’t walk na na(all burst into laughter) then when he is told to tell you that you walk to beau i swim calculate the quicker(all burst into laughter,.) then jump in the water and charge at him he will be too happy but sidestep him and charge at his master(all laugh) he will catch you being faster then tell him i was going to complain to your beau(all burst into laughter) meaning your Palkia took that the brat’s master is the beau so can swim as quickly which is wrong so the brat has to protect her thus responsible thus lose(all burst into laughter) as you will then say that your beau is standing there i can reach you can’t(all burst into laughter) but yeah i can’t swim quicker if in water so lets discuss about responsible dates(all burst into laughters) finally when he is frustrated cause he will want to play but doesn’t due to responsibility and Palkia detects this lie(all burst into laughter and .) and you’re so fresh cause you haven’t fought at all(all laugh) create the dragon rage whirl at full force to get the brat out of water then hyper beam it out of roof(all laugh) cause detecing a lie after death will get the Palkia back to life to do something about it(all burst into laughter) but the Palkias i saw so far most are kids at most going to advanced universites or just about proposed seriously for a change(all burst into laughter) your has some material of wise life and beyond cause it’s battle scaled(all laugh) to be less responsible(all laugh) thus should be rubbed to that way but remember the other brats will infringe their trust with Palkia and so on and then with you it’s just so many things that needs to be done by enquerying them psychologically creating pressure of exams again and again(all laugh) but anyway your Palkia would’ve beaten that leader in this way and her obsession with using Golduck first and not second and Jellicent the other way around to create the more-less responsible to the less-more responsible cause only then she is going with her choise and Sharpedo must always be last IF trained right to be not serious at all(all laugh) or might’ve been Kyogre in place of Jellicent cause then the less-more would’ve become rather blur but then Sharpedo will spoil the expected marks getting one more by copying hallucination(all burst into laughter) and so on many possibilities for both of you but these are natures only and ways to get the job done butt i don’t understand her obsession to force her psychics to use those useless jovial classroom joke hallucinations(all burst into laughter) cause the wickedness isn’t properly veiled which can only be done in kids find first beau behind 2nd beau hallucinations(all burst into laughter,.) cause then you’re wicked so the opponent gets that and does plan to counter and exactly when they counter you say life is such(all burst into laughter) that means you were being honest only that you’re more wicked than they think(all laugh) so the brat would’ve been at bay as his master would’ve been baffled to see the overall package of honestly dishonest hallucinations(all burst into laughter,.) they have to be varied though the thousands of degrees and subcategories are there(all burst into laughter) yeah everyday as you know a new hallucination is being defined(all laugh) then says could've been Tapu Fini,Slowking and Manaphy as well psudeo-legend psychic then normal psychic then only psudeo-legend natural psychic with fairy tendency which Tapu Fini has a bit as well then Carracosta in it against Palkia not good but Kyogre good enough or even Primarina if trained with Kaledo infighting(all laugh) Kaledo would've been not of any use against either Palkia or Kyogre at all cause he's been made responsible(all burst into laughter) but this idea that she has that she can battle is totally wrong(all burst into laughter) cause she is teaching her students you rather battle your style is rather in each move you study and then decide and do the next move and then only the next move comes which you sometimes may predict or sometimes just wait to counter but she mostly predicts and counters less you the opposite and hence she teaches you are a grand student ever she more of a teaching mentality like you are a better researcher she the professor like Crawdaunt and Feraligator(all burst into laughter) i said,well i'm only happy we're not pokemons and we don't ask Gary for the reason of this(all laugh) being born that is(all laugh) then he continued,or like Gengleye(all burst into laughter)she is Gengar you Sableye but she resists herself to not be a Gengar hence her troubles unnecessarily(all burst into laughter) but exactly why she thinks she has a specific gender(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) and hence i do too(all burst into laughter) hence she broke-up her(all burst into laghter) then i somehow managed not to laugh too much to avoid becoming Sablaye thus remembering my gender for my wife's sake to avoid her horripilation even in divorce proceedings in witness box(all uncontrollbaly laugh) and asked him can your bunch manage other pokemons in battles(all laugh),yeah why not(all laugh) if they allow them to that is to have their ways out of the despondency of this present being(all laugh) this presence is what my Banette researches upon(all burst into laughter) as you know cause it doesn't exist conceptually only as a thirst to think on the same(all burst into laughter) i said,yeah i understand your stylish translators(all laugh) then he says,yeah that should've been brought forth ages ago why this obsession with being Ash that i have Dave which my Kyurem doesn't like and she has sound logic as well for that(all burst into laughter) i said you better have noiser logic(all laugh),i see too fond(all laugh)so was she hence her troubles(all laugh) i thought yeah obviously mutual(all laugh) then he says,Tapu Fini at full potential must be told to study the varying levels of caution that one has when this urge to expand the self out of being comes up and why does it happen despite the urge itself(all burst into laughter) then he will answer that this caution is the reason for that urge and that urge isn't necessary at all cause that itself is the illusion that's the necessity of the same to continue it to hinder him all the time(all laugh),cause one wants to expand cause one thinks that he's the one and only(all laugh) if he didn't then he has no reason or meaning to be a being(all laugh) thus if he doesn't know the reason is because this being is not self sufficient hence this urge comes to validate it and everything else is spontaneous to find that closing door to which ends the being but this just piles up the dust rather one must understand how to turn against the very own being cause that's what it does all time look at the time now it's midnight at your place so why are you in rush to sleep(all burst into laughter),because you think you're a being that needs to but in subtle body that isn't there hence who are you(all burst into laughter) if Tapu Fini knows this(all burst into laughter) then he can deliver against the lie detection the host of poor men's get together party(all burst into laughter) where you get trapped by the emotion of closure that the fairy nature of Tapu Fini will help thus even if you do detect the lie still you will get emotional then the psychic cruelty works that his income is so mearge and family responisibilities so now what if Tapu Fini gets unemployed(all burst into laughter) this will make you think twice this time bought is the victory(all laugh) then this is Palkia but Kyogre life dictates that the vastness of ocean and sky confines themselves in the solid state hence it's about potential of life thus they will kill you to see through you,you see(all burst into laughter) so for anyone to get to the full potential one must let himself get killed(all laugh) then to do that(all burst into laughter) Kyogre must be asked of his opinions on the idea of mistake and definition(all burst into laughter) mistakes will be there so will definitions otherwise life can't go by this path of illusion hence he will cut off every possible mistakes and definitions as well to realize the potential is only full if dead(all brust into laughter) hence his being will surpass himself thus at full potential he will be too happy to battle(all brust into laughter) cause there's no such thing as other cause that's a mistaken definition(All burst into laughter) thus he will kill you to or try to by fondling with your nerves at his whim(all burst into laughter) and if you don't allow he will tame you by himself(all burst into laughter) then such a Kyogre is brilliant but then she might've used Slowking who must be asked of his opinions on break-ups(all burst into laughter) mentally that is(all burst into laughter) the point when you don't trust your partner of husband or beau of even like family parents,siblings,children,relatives anyone when you don't trust then that moment before you are decided beyond doubts is when your being is most free cause you don't depend upon any hence your're too trapped cause you depened upon yourself(all burst into laughter) cause your idea of the self is just your being hence wrong all and then this was fuelled by the trust you had and so on but in this junction is Slowking is taken too many times his happiness will turn into depression that is killing him(all burst into laughter) sanity that is(all burst into laughter) hence he gets woken to the slowness of kingsley life of irresponsibility(all burst into laughter) this means he's never serious thus he's ever winner cause the idea of responsibility is an hindrence that is hindering my well being here you see Dave why am i Ash Ketchum(all burst into laughter) i said,well i don't agree with your Kyurem on this(all laugh) and say it's cause you're born so(all laugh) but what about Manaphy(all laugh),yeah the Manaphian life says innocence is a crude virtue(all burst into laughter) there are many you see who wants this innocence this naivety some are born so(all laugh,Ash cheers for Boulder all laugh even more,Brock laughs shaking his head) then this urge is ever there cause when we depend on others we may have to have some degree of dishonesty that is a burden and hence we're not happy thus this infact permeates the whole life to every degree hence you can't be innocent at all thus you should be crude but at the same time this is going to overburden you cause you are going against your natural state but that state itself it actually the reason for your trouble(all laugh) thus the only way to get rid of this is to be innocently cunning(all laugh) that is you try to know this idea of other why it exists is cause you exist as other to them(all burst into laughter) thus this idea of innocence to them will become Manaphy's veil to hallucinate other people while he himself is free of it thus he is no being but then if he isn't any being he isn't bothered at all about others cause they don't exist so the innocence is naturalized and thus this very existence is the hallucination as to they won't know what Manaphy wants hence he wins cause this idea the opponent's master will foist on his pokemon that Manaphy is here to battle which he isn't(all burst into laughter) hence it breaks his chain with the master and you win(all laugh) so to get to this point a Manaphy must be asked to prepare a lecture that pierces through the idea he has of his master(all burst into laughter) this bond will get him to be pure and the previous state thus he rather will take you under his wings but if you don't allow him to have his ways then he will take liberties with your brain(all burst into laughter) then i said,i only am so greateful to myself that i didn't do this to mine(all laugh) but can a pokemon get to this level in wild and if he can then can you catch him(all laugh),yeah they have to have that idea when they are born then they can with experience but yeah human stages are important my lab colleagues has played a huge role in my bunch's state that you know without the liberty and the medicines they would'nt have become what they are now,medicines my colleague used that is(all laugh) and yeah they might be still in wild but they may come to you if you go to wild like you know i went to Hematoborg district forest,Cariostrog,Kalos to get a Dusknoir and i didn't use any pokemons directly cause with my experience of ghosts i thought they are rather courteous to foregin travellers who ask for an opinion of the currenet times of his society from them(all uncontrollbaly laugh)like poverty(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) so i went there first my bunch played around with me cause i was discussing the same with them to get the compatriots opinion on the country(all burst into laughter) then we approached them then i asked them who are financially poor among them(all brust into laughter) finance is as you know the intelligence factor(all laugh) then they said intelligence is you see lad is your mistake of being(all laugh) cause if you were intelligent why are you bounded by the idea of the yourself(all burst into laughter) then i had a good time at their collges(all laugh) one of their bright students came along with me she was in a great service among them was doing her thesis on disturbence due to the idea of time(all burst into laughter) this actually is a trouble you see in their life as well as ours cause their view of life is if no time then no idea of anything hence all is to it's fullest but the idea of time is intrinsic as long as you're a being cause each moment it will force you the idea of moment and hence you must be not so to go to the fullest to live the perfect Dusknoir life that is philosophically firm hence metaphysically supple(all burst into laughter) thus i asked her to teach me the difference between temporality and subjectivity(all burst into laughter),she later told me after getting in my group that yeah this ideas are contradictory to each other cause your idea of subject is ever you hence being you why this futile urge again to be you(all laugh) and the idea of time is the reason for that which again is neated if you were you then now still so why the time hence nothing can be fixed upon in time or being thus there's no point in being sane either cause temporality is responsibility and subjectivity is sanity hence if you know you're sane why appease others being responsible to yourself(all burst into laughter) and the viseversa if you're responsible why be sane(all burst into laughter) but you can't be in both cases hence you must get rid of the idea and thus comes the real time and sanity and everything living in time knowing it's just an idea of non exactitude that points to the insanity cause you're such as you are no being hence all these are hallucinations thus why bother at all about anything except time when you can remain non-exact thus can penetrate those who are not so that's your food cause they will like you(all laugh) so you see Dave why my lab is so unique(all laugh) i said yeah,hence they are paid that sum(all laugh) but hence also i guess you enter volcanoes unprotected to unearth such gems to us at the cost of your lab and opponents(all laugh),no it's just this idea you know that i have that has been troubling me since day 0 here why am i a human(all burst into laughter) hence Kyurem is so important in my life you see and the viseversa and then Charizard too(all burst into laughter) cause his idea of proper approach to dates if is seen through it's just you yourself ain't it this idea you had of Zara and the viseversa is why you were there in the first and then you two are soulmates so basically the oneness became manifested but before that it still was idea and it's the same for all if you didn't have an idea of her and the viseversa why would you be bothered at all but you did get enough bothered meance the actuality only translates if patience to find own self is there hence Bulbasaur told you what is the meaning of what(all burst into laughter) i said,yeah i'm so lucky that i don't have one myself who forces himself to be me and hence the viseversa is too maddening for me(all laugh),yeah,this problem of lenght of time and the pressure of history too has been worked upon by my Grumpig(all brust into laughter) her method is that if i was then and i am now and so on then why not then then was i and now now is me so i become the time hence where's objectivity thus history(all burst into laughter) i said,yeah being from Celestic surely such guides would've took away many people's jobs and researches(all laugh),then bro went on to talk about Mantine(all laugh) how Mantine's life is about being happily ferrying the idea of insanity(all burst into laughter) any idea(all laugh).."
Violet(laugh) : "i'm only happy that i didn't teach philosophy to my boy(all laugh) else would've intruded mid song to tell me give up this confining idea of harmony(all burst into laughter)"
David(laugh) : "yeah mid-match still better than that atleast(all laugh)then i after this long sermon(all laugh) asked him how long does it take(all laugh) said that well all about the nature of pokemons and to beat the brat in his own game so he changes the nature or not(all laugh) but deepens it each time(all laugh) i said yeah 10 lives later may be(all laugh) and he never used to speak in such details in case of other gyms as to my strategies rather said yeah this combination and that way of attacking and so on like normal people do(all laugh) but no they weren't normal either(all laugh) cause you know he never attacked at all after 1st year travel all the brats themselves did(all laugh) he day one told me they were asked what is the difference between attacking idea and idea oritented attack(all burst into laughter) so then actually didn't want to influence me much cause once you hear these you don't want to attack either to your utmost doom(all laugh) bro as many say was just the tonic needed to get to your work once more with a smile on your face hence only he is so sought after with his bunch but the smiles in Gary and Trace and now Brock's face tell a different story(all laugh) and Brock actually travelling was way easier wasn't it than 24/7 lunacy(all laugh).."
Brock(laugh) : "yeah,atleast could mingle in foods without getting caught(all laugh)"
David(laugh) : "actually your dishes were too delicious to get them along with bro to this state(all laugh) anyway,so this went on in case of other gyms but then as usual the mention of Misty and her skills mean they must be absolutely as according to him cause she’s his forever wife hence must be a Gengar as well(all laugh) and i must be told that way of countering to and hallucinating(all laugh) so that he himself later has food for thought on how to counter himself(all laugh) and if i can help on that(all laugh) well Feraligator ever could and sadly does despite our wishes(all laugh) and that much bro did too cause he had that big bro attitude then hidden towards me otherwise and that in general as May and Drew says especially Drew cause bro was after him(all laugh) i only wonder if my wife had a bro and asked me she will get mentally decapacitated will you like the vomit still(all laugh) and my answer will be judged by my Kommo-O's idea of life(all laugh) but Drew especially said that unless bro feels that the person truely believes that he can change them for betterment in life not in battling(all laugh) then one will be praised to heaven(all laugh) with little changes here and there which themselves are good enough cause of that language(all laugh) and all these ideas are the little changes which none ever thought so(all laugh) but to him that is honestly dishonest hallucination(all laugh) cause he you know wants to sit on your shoulder and act as his Gengar do with you personally too(all laugh),anyway then i thought i too can do the dishonestly honest hallucinations(all laugh) so i said well Misty is too good and Misty will soon get the nomination and yeah Misty(all laugh) is a respected name now but Misty’s bunch(all laugh)...Misty!Misty,Misty,Misty,Misty!(all laugh) as if in the whole world none other has that name(all laugh) what is that name,yeah Misty!(all laugh) and none else is a water pokemon trainer with that name(all laugh) what is it,yeah Misty!(all laugh) and no gym can be better or equal to that damn Cerulian(all laugh) cause who is the leader yeah Misty!(all laugh) don’t pester me by naming so and so whoose name aptly suits her nature(all laugh) but yeah always skillfull with water pokemons beat me ages ago thrice good trainer nice person so nice and sweet little girl(all laugh) but gone to the bay(all laugh) i said bro still said the name 8 times(all laugh) why not contact her for once(all laugh) cause 8 times the same times the infinity,i’m a boy and she’s a girl and it’s honestly immoral by all ethical standards to talk with a girl for no reason even being a girl(all burst into laughter) which made me realize that one sermon for 1.5 hours at his place when it's 23:30-1(all laugh) was enough for a day as ISD charges are costly(all laugh) but Foster’s full life along with his relationship status and how good his then fiancee was and yeah to bro girlfriend means fiancee so Mrs is definitely usable(all laugh) and Mr and Mrs Slate’s full life was foisted upon me(all laugh) and then with Brock as well whom he hadn’t talked to since the end of Kanto cause he changed profession(all laugh) but still without him he would've never been able to complete his first region itself(all laugh) and yeah Daisy was namecalled(all laugh) without her he would've had to quit the profession(all laugh) and Trace was mentioned as being just a great lab colleague actually only his skills never the relations just said Orange travel compnaion and like Brock much help then got infatuated with Professor(all laugh) and Foster was babysitted to heaven as to as i said this and this i did he played the role of Foster and was trying to gauge what Foster could do better which i said i’ve been asked midmatch umpteenth times from the devil himself(all laugh) then said sweet kids sweet litlle kids(all laugh) and then Brawn(all laugh) said such a man should be given a separate place in history and fame who inspires all to lead a life of a happiest ghost type(all laugh) i said yeah like Gengar(all laugh) said yeah i agree Gengar’s have only one partner for life or stay alone similarly happy in both cases(all laugh) but that match was philosophically discussed(all laugh) Brawn i knew would be 1 on 1(all laugh) so i chose Rotom(all laugh) Brawn goes with Thundurus(all laugh) but said just watch the fun as my brat loses his temper with ghostly games(all burst into laughter) i understood i’ve entered school again(all laugh),anyway then he ever knew will win Kalos(all laugh) and my stipulation for wanting to travel another region to complete was that if i lose that i’ll not get the rejected hall of fame just the special tag(all laugh) bro didn’t know this cause we suppressed that else with all his mental devastating condition after coming out of that mess,he would’ve created a mayhem(all laugh) and he himself scoffed the authority off by saying if he is forced to stay around Sinnoh Elite4 HQ for cases that have no meaning then he will release his bunch in wild(all laugh) that meant whole world wild pokemons will get spoiled(all laugh) so they allowed him to go to Kalos and asked me if they were fondling with me then he will give Bulbasaur to me so i said no it’s alright i’ve a family now(all laugh) and that’s cause Bulbasaur will try to dictate my pace being leader and now he being alone and relieved off the duty mask(all laugh) neither his ways nor language nor ideas will suitable in a civic room or to a sane person(all laugh) cause after i did my proposal undercover that is(all laugh) he told me you look serious today don't you understand the difference is only in your ideas but never in actual between tickling of the suited one to the sweetened one(all burst into laughter) so i realized no wonder why this pest is the leader of the bachelor's mess(all laugh) and now this meance was trying to forcefully admit me to his gang by trying to break up my marriage already(all laugh) and that too by giving the soulmate theory to confuse me even more(all laugh) and i too then in undercover thought even then only cause of such brats may be did bro's marriage broke-off(all laugh) i came to know about sis next week actually to this(all laugh),anyway,then i manage to win Kanto he gets Kalos and he monitored me throughout the region as if he is influencing my game to an extent where i lose my individuality or not and so on this continued till final and i was being cheered up by his knowledge of Kommo-O(all laugh) and so on then i win after the final ends congratulates me then says this is my schedule of Elite4 and i saw absurdly incredible workload(all laugh) then later asked me what are the chains that they’ve put around you(all laugh) i said no i need to win 3 atleast and draw another atleast rather than 4 and 1(all laugh) said i see has Zara agreed(all laugh) i said yeah she’s ok with another year cause she knows me too well sadly(all laugh) said alright if you feel like not continuing or anything that is hindering your game and mental emotions(all laugh) then tell me except Lance i’ll see about rules(all laugh) and you know his schedule and the general hall of fame both groups infact were in HQ all together to take a picture with him(all laugh) and even Katy went there too zealous(all laugh) she spoiled me actually(all laugh) bro said i can’t appease all(all laugh) and was visiting gyms and only appeased the senior hall of fame(all laugh) still appeased 56 juniors in total(all laugh) and told me that his bunch can work independently and i knew they could do so during undercover 3 years back what to speak of now(all laugh) and yeah then could manage as well sadly(all laugh) but that is despite my wishes of course which was my apprehension(all laugh) but he couldn’t show that then his bunch would’ve been in danger which now though has been removed(all laugh) they really are invincible now unless humans resort to that only eternal all weather option called the bottom line(all laugh) surely Dusknoir can't solve this poverty(all laugh) so then that wasn’t the case so that he didn’t do(all laugh).."
Ash(laugh) : "just an eloquent intervention(all laugh),here we've discussed about my final matches against Dillon and Patricia and Nigel of course(all laugh) so i will mention your final Kanto match as well(all laugh) make time like Dusky does(all laugh)..yeah i saw that actually live if time suited(all laugh) you know my finals were unfair on my opponents since Unova itself(all laugh) should've just let me travel the gyms and the region that's all i wanted in Kalos atleast(all laugh),anyway,Dave is Dave as you know too sweetly reddened like his little sister-pester(all laugh) but is more matured about the costs of proposal(all laugh),actually i knew that given he is all fine would win Kanto cause once you've seen that hell of rockets you can win leagues in your dreams given you're great to begin with and his bunch is exactly that so he did get out of the groups in flying colours then the knockouts were excellent and comprehensive victories as well,quarter finals was his toughest match actually against Linda Mastom who was doing her 5th region a two time champ hence was desperate(all laugh) is a great competitior anyway then that went onto the wire and Dave's Bisharp just got out by 10 seconds after the double count and after that i was kinda apprehensive realized first time what my bench ever thought(all laugh) and then after that i congratulated him and also told him i realized what die hard fans think(all laugh) he said yeah alright no trouble but had he lost would've been very sad for me but i had my plans ready to insinuate of course(all laugh) that i want a personal match with Dave using Trevor's bunch(all laugh) and you know what happens then(all laugh) actually would've broken the myth that time that i could do anything with anyone's bunch cause i can't cause i can't attack even rightly(all laugh) Solgaleo was asked 10000 times what is snarl blitz(all laugh) it's ever the counter unless i'm shown something i can't discover at all(all laugh) so anyway,Dave won was a very tough match against Linda at quarters but that he did well and Bisharp withstood the great Reshiram(all laugh),Linda is from Unova(all laugh) anyway,then semis were brilliant for Dave just brushed aside another multiple time champ and then in final faced Abraham Opatumos,3rd region infact from Orange and already a champ in Orange itself had Palkia at first region at Orange(all laugh) then was a good match,Abraham actually did brilliantly throughout won again 3,6 time champs back to back from last 16 and before that defeated another two 7 time champs in groups(all laugh) but the kid was a kid still(all laugh) so Dave won the final comprehensively as well and then the quarter final actually i wanted to talk about but can't remember anything except Reshiram vs Bisharp(all laugh) was 8 on 8 in total,both Reshiram and Bisharp were fresh and took 44 minutes(all laugh) total match,4 hours 6 minutes(all laugh) and in final the last was Emboar vs Groudon actually Abraham's Groudon was a great match for more than 20 minutes and Emboar again just won but Groudon was Abraham's last Emboar had a backup still(all laugh) so you realize how great Dave was in that match(all laugh) anyway,then no more interveneing but still man in Unova my brats didn't let me sleep even(all laugh).."
David(laugh) : "hence should've dragged Trace along with you the horizon is ever so confining(all laugh),anyway then i entered Elite4 and then i knew all main Elite4 heads and everyone else of course as well comrade Jasu and Stu McShin(all laugh) then i get my schedule Lance at 3,Persy at 4,Trevor at 6(all laugh) that 1,3,2 and Persy as you know the office pressure is hindering him though way less now but after the lure machine bid is driven here(all laugh) we’re getting a new Lance(all laugh) and Mark both me and bro have faced as much dangerous and lost to Persy twice rest equally shared but those two both were runners up level at league finals(all laugh) and he knows that Kommo-O is a fly/water type whoose evoled form is Pelipper(all laugh) and still both Jasu and McShin are lunatic battlers(all laugh) so 5-2 means 9-0 now(all laugh) hopefully Mark is at total bay and McShin is in total mess to get the two down much and still our sweet sweet Jasu is there(all laugh) anyway all three wants to get involved in everything cause all is battle to them and Jasu most hence so much moling bonhomie of sweetness(all laugh)..well,i’m no better than them either like bro was when he wasn’t hearing that maddening tune(all laugh) but we atleast don’t want to get involved in official matters(all laugh)..but just a bit bro,what’s the current lunacy level(all laugh)
Ash(laugh) : “well,i only don’t officially battle hence travel around as Dragonite or Pelipper(all laugh)..”
David(laugh) : “that’s why the dragons aren’t happy at all cause only Rayquaza gets the leeway to pester all of them(all laugh)..anyway Trevor asked me are you happy with the schedule till your crowning cause you see it’s one man autocracy now waiting to hand you over the reigns while he retires to Safforn Forest only to re-emerge again in our happiest dreams if that’s at your cost(all laugh) i said yeah i have to be happy cause anyway i’ll get the double crown but is my other half revered too(all laugh) said yeah defintely general government is also interested cause of the money generated(all laugh) so then i win 2 then enter Lance’s den(all laugh) bro said man i can’t help you only on this Lance is such a cute little innocent kid of 60(all burst into laughter) i said why do you still stand on the patform(all laugh) said,no my brats otherwise will make the who place the battlefield leaving the crowd in danger thus me cause they want to intrude everyone now to increase the number games for greater fun(all laugh),then at Elite4s he also asked every details about my match and mood and everything else(all laugh) then said if a single hall of fame brat beat you and show as if he or she is better just give me the name what means pokemon training at 1:30 am in deep Safforn Forest Gengleye will show with most entertainment(all laugh) i said well we’ll see(all laugh) then while i came to Kanto,inquired about Cerulian of course(all laugh) and then Misty was very seriously battling and was on her way getting the tag so i infact thought she might’ve moved on(all laugh) so was dissapointed(all laugh) and i told bro that just as a in between line stuff cause in Hoenn he was then was telling this to the whole world along with Hoopa and Uxie at press(all laugh) so i recuperate him(all laugh) that Misty is very serious now about the tag now and Misty is battling well i heard(all laugh),’yeah,yeah again that so and so(all laugh),Misty isn’t it Misty(all laugh) what’s the chosen name yeah,Misty(all laugh) what was Oracle that i heard first day on my journey yeah,Misty(all laugh),i’m all fine but then who is it that must be associeted with me yeah,Misty(all laugh) you see for a married person like you to talk about certain stars with tainted past is harmful to your mental well being thus affecting your other half just cut it(all burst into laughter)’,so i got first the number game again(all laugh) and then the inter spouse skirmish part only(all laugh) so i realized that his antics were getting more and more severe cause of that pain(all laugh) so said,no it’s just that to be honest she might’ve moved on that’s all what i’m saying as you get excited as soon as the name come up too much(all laugh),’yeah i understand my mistake with less dark skin(all laugh) i’m not marrying any girl in this life including Ms Misty Waterflower,part time gym leader(all laugh),Cerulian City that damn water gym REPLACING Daisy(all laugh) cause she and the rest are girls(all laugh)..’ then this is before Kalos so after that as i said that press came up and i knew all for that Kalos incident mostly(all laugh) and the whole world was wanting a piece of him and yet be afraid of him cause he did literally seem like a Gengar since Sinnoh to Johto(all laugh) anyway then we go to Kalos where we get our bond and then he enters Johto but me Unova(all laugh) and i also heard newses as did bro we both brushed them aside saying get the Kalos money involved if they are tickling you(all laugh) in Johto bro was doing imposible antics(all laugh) and kept telling us just a few more days of circus then i can retire with my bunch(all laugh) and we were getting babysitted for about 1.5 months by then(all laugh) and we just understood the break-up was too severe on him as i said and Misty didn’t have an easy time either atleast for long so we were dissapointed and then that part goes then i go to Sinnoh finally then i won 4 so already was qualified just formalities were there(all laugh) and he goes to Orange so he finished a month before me there and when i go to Orange he was one month in Kanto and Orange as usual did give him jerks(all laugh) and i know that special temporal sentence as well from the great rockets themselves(all laugh) he was saying first league here so many years later Lapras and all but his tone was dissapointing(all laugh) but in Orange he didn’t show any outside symbols but that Kalos stuff came to an agreement so he mellowed down a bit in public but only for a few days(all laugh) and then he said i don’t want to do Kanto Lance is so sweet(all laugh) Lance coerced him in there(all laugh) and Kanto for bro really is something cause he knows Unova better that any humans cause he has known it from Kommo-O(all laugh) and next Kalos and Sinnoh similar Kalos just more gyms,Sinnoh more chosen brat valleys(all laugh) and undercover(all laugh) Kalos the universities of course(all laugh) and then he knows Kanto then Hoenn then Johto then Orange last and Kanto is divided some people thinks he’s great some the opposite none neutral(all laugh) and so on so his antics at Kanto was maximum(all laugh) and that helped Lance then now us for sure(all laugh) and this goes on but then finally by then Misty was in hall of fame(all laugh) and hence there bro did so few gyms so by then the 5 hall of fames were contacted by Platue themselves(all laugh) but bro disagreed before their replies(all laugh) said it’ll be humiliating to me much to my bunch’s liking(all laugh) and then Sabrina didn’t send her reply of course cause she knew every detail of bro’s bunch and own level changes(all laugh) was visited privately later(all laugh) and then finally Misty was contacted and refused(all laugh) rest were visited at night(all laugh) and we were interested to know what happens to Cerulian City Gym(all laugh) by then i knew about my little sis and well Mr Maple himself invited and all that was ok as i heard but this was something and i surely knew that Misty wasn’t alright at all via my sources which are all over the world as part of undercover(all laugh) so then bro of course told that he isn’t visiting misbehaving gyms(all laugh) and Misty told playboy’s not allowed(all laugh) so i came to know that and in Kanto it was the peak of antics(all laugh) and then Lance i contacted a few times he said it’ll bust after the final(all laugh) and so on and by then i was way more frank with Lance and Trevor as usual(all laugh) i said Lance you’re a sweet little innocent kid hence didn’t want to come or help me against you(all laugh) Lance was laughing so much said my number one spot has been secured in my 4 leftover years for sure now exactly why i coerced him in else certain words would’ve been associeted with me(all laugh) anyway,finally he finishes the Elite4 on the same month i do i was thinking on what whether i should get in the Elite4 office or not but pests were at me as usual why they too weren’t invited there on the final show as they couldn’t black tickets(all laugh) and so on finally call comes(all laugh and .)..and i so much recall that and since Kalos we ever called each other bro sometimes i big bro and he little bro and since Kalos itself he used to tell me about his whole life mentioning everything except exactly you all(all laugh) by calling names that is(all laugh) but abstractly i knew everything the names weren’t mentioned(all laugh) and our little sis was mentioned before that with a note that she isn’t a little girl anymore cause now a responsible old woman(all burst into laughter) i had by then realized that he only understands family realtions and nothing else(all laugh) and exactly why i was never said harsh words and babysitted me and Zara as well cause she also was like his sis(all laugh) but thankfully unlike Drew(all laugh) so didn't spew(all laugh) and i knew about his income and as well the similar expenditure which is escalating day by day to keep his bunch sanely lunatic by means of human labour(all laugh) and that’s exactly that(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) and all that money and all were as usual channeled to places(all laugh) and i also was asked if all my incomes were ok or not and so on else he knew everyone everywhere(all laugh) and if he didn’t his bunch would’ve found them out at midnight(all laugh) and my uncle and aunt and Luc and Tayla as well did speak with him quite a few times they were also asked if i was getting too overzealous with things or not(all laugh) and later after we were brothers my family was very happy as well as they are about anything all time like Brawn(all laugh) then anyway,finally Lance gets the best seat for the circus(all laugh) and that match itself was something(all laugh) then call comes straight to Trevor i want lackies(all burst into laughter) Trevor said why,’um..well the wills and all my gifts i want to distribute among many be 1000 people who shaped my career and 1249 gyms as well’ now Trevor of course knew the whole world as did(all laugh) that it was 1250(all laugh) so Trevor said that the other gym(all laugh) no that’s a separate matter a bit fishy place(all laugh) need no know the activites there despite my endeavours(all laugh) then Trevor says your eternal lackie is here(all laugh) then i get the call,’um..Dave listen my flower(all laugh) sorry Misty Waterflower Ketchum..um..(all laugh)..just that i want to marry my Mist immediately(all laugh)..you know Dave finally finally,found indeed that namecalled Misty(all laugh) was only a veil of illusion on both me and my dear Mist,my Mist is just that not that damn Misty cause namecall is a psuchophysical mass of garbage(all laugh) and infact why i say even more is cause Zara was taught these by sis herself to get me(all laugh)..anyway,then,bro continues,my Mist isn’t a girl or a psychophysiomotional entity i finally absolutely realized(all laugh) she’s more my me myself my dear soulmate(all laugh) so she isn’t happy at all without me and hence she just should be my wife right now(all laugh) and she has been in so much pain and still is and if any damn brat is currently with her i’ll see how long he stays sane when he becomes the roomate at Pogamobstrog,Kalos,to a college-bully Darkrai at his own den(all burst into laughter) and if any chosen ones have in this 4 years tried to look at my Mist then..(all laugh)..anyway,so don’t know the queue(all laugh) all i know is that she wasn’t married 6/7 months ago AND THAT’S ENOUGH TO GET HER DIVROCED(all burst into laughter)..my Mist will never be happy with another brat except me as i said WHY IS SHE NOT WITH ME NOW(all laugh)..anyway,thus NO WAY OUT(all laugh)..i’ll see how good in anatomy(all burst into laughter,.)..anyway thus can’t date(all laugh) thus each brat with their beaus and their brats(all laugh) must be hunted down immediately and if she is married recently how long what biography(all laugh) who if were are formers how they broke up(all burst into laughter) which damn family how met my Mist everything(all laugh) if goes out of our world’s jurisdiction i’m rich you know(all laugh) and then the rest my ghosts will see how MUCH is the LONGING(all laugh) and Sinnoh general government knows me as well if from there no brats will get to court even(all laugh) and wherever the brats may be when the family is gifted a very special buddy of mine and a very special friend of mine they surely won’t(all laugh) Heracross and Mewoth(all burst into laughter) and if out of profession i’ll see how they stay sane being lost at Karapasker Wetland forests Giratina’s very own homely den(all laugh) and Confragigus knows Huntelion too well(all laugh) and both are school dropouts(all burst into laughter) and i’ve got Lance with me and Simon too but Kanto Elite4 is beautiful(all laugh) i said fine and then go and then he says but are you in service i said no first day out(all laugh) then scoffed at me saying just send the men my bunch works independently despite me and my location(all laugh) i told him it’s just your vultures here(all laugh) the smell isn’t good neither the flesh for long enjoyment(all laugh) anyway then both me and Zara apprise the budding Gengar bro(all laugh) that it’s definitely better to leave ghosts alone(all laugh) Zara before me said if you don’t i’ll get the divorce ready aginst any so and so cause the gym situation was of course very bad and the expolitation of expression card is only created for these situations(all burst into laughter) and then team is formed and Lance told Trevor to help couples reunite for a vacation(all laugh) Trevor said he knows about Sinnoh more than me(all laugh) and the Elite4 too than both you and me(all laugh) he can pick lackies and Persy is too much a fanboy now(all laugh) and mostly if he wants he can make my own office to kick me out of my cabin and help him to date his girlfriend exactly there in full comfort all he wants(all laugh) what’s the pin that pierced the heart becoming an arrow of that type(all uncontrollbaly laugh)..
Gary(laugh) : “yeah,now all are after me(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : "Mr Oak why is it called pierced(all burst into laughter).."
Lillie(laugh) : "and Mr Oak why does it pierce only the born thus heart(all bursat into laughter)"
Gary(laugh) : "no you see got my wife spoiled and my son as well and this is humiliation by all means of ME using MY(all laugh)"
David(laugh) : “no really Gary,it’s hard now to desist(all laugh)..anyway,Lance said well about Kanto he was regretting that Kanto was his first region so hasn’t met many chosen ones(all laugh) and the arrow is that saw a certain picture of a certain Ms Misty Waterflower,hall of fame water gym here at Cerulian and was totally Mistyfied for 30 minutes(all laugh) said no it’s alright first travel companion hence a bit of emotion(all laugh) but that was so much that wanted to know everything about her recreating the same situation even in front of me without any reservations at all(all laugh) so i insinuated this(all laugh) said no long collaboration of 15 years of that type(all laugh) so a bit of emotion(all laugh)thus the engagement broke off for some reason and both probably are too hurt since and the ego won't allow them unless luck of afterlife luckily for all of us it has been the former(all laugh)anyway,then came out as lunatic as his Tyranitar only could imagine(all laugh) and erupted on juniors at 23:30(all laugh) whole world was called in their sleep or lunch and mouthed them off with that language as we know till 2:30 am(all laugh) 3 full hour of nonstop chiding met many choised ones in info books now desperate to meet them in person(all laugh) and thus made my job too easy now atleast at some levels(all laugh) and Persy's too even more(all laugh) so we better comply after his bunch complied with us for 7 years not making everyone go mad excluding McShin cause he faced him again as i compelled him to(all laugh) McShin brought that up in courts as you know and bro was so sorry for that but Lance,Simon and else said it’s no big deal it’s ok but bro directly threatened McShin by saying too much noise is being made do they really want him to break rules and get legends(all laugh) McShin tried to scoff at him saying you’re getting out of hand(all laugh) said,i see out of hand,sweet sweet Stu(all laugh) then i should surrender to the international court at Hagelassberg,Hoenn shouldn’t i(all laugh) McShin immediately said fine this this time i’m at office call me before coming here i’ll sweep the floors of my cabin myself and take orders to serve the food as you date your wife there all you wish(all laugh) even Kanto government of all places has agreed first time along with Kalos that is(all laugh) who again followed suit being first time with Unova that is of all places(all laugh) that terminating this bunch will end the whole pokemon profession itself cause 75% will REVOLT(all laugh) that too being taught by the greatest revolutionary of the most sinister type(all laugh) and then at his deathbed to add to(all laugh) thus all other pokemons will follow suit and all these are only letting the bottom line move up to their throats hence McShin should be kept at ground(all laugh)..then anyway first meeting was there 7 people were there me and Jack of course(all laugh) who is a mole against Jasu(all laugh) and is a clever fox despite being a Sinnoh Frontier champ once(all laugh) well you know that was his 2nd region after the main Sinnoh but then heard that maddening tune of outside profession at 20(all laugh) and he went in vacation during the Unovan fiasco and complained to the court everyday about paychecks to his bunch’s energy drinks(all laugh) and we had another two extract-the-minerals lackies from our farm base(all laugh) who can extract their own infos again(all laugh) and Simon with his three officials were set upon the whole world(all laugh) now i will ever remember the team setup(all laugh), ‘yeah,gentlemen and ladies(all laugh) and respected Mr Simon Gower,i’m sorry to get you involved in my personal business but really i want to be legal(all laugh) the thing is that the Cerulian city gym is very interesting to me(all laugh) and my 2nd badge there but just leave it i want my Mist(all laugh) um..sorry just emotions(all laugh) by then we all were silently laughing(all laugh) so i first want to know about the current marital status of Misty Waterflower the youngest waterflower sisters there all i know about 6 months ago she wasn’t married and main gym leader now and the marital status means since this date each month in 6(all burst into laughter) how many selected class tried to look at my sweet flower and especially who are their chosen secretaries(all laugh)..um..sorry(all laugh)...and we realized that unless we help him all the psychic and ghost bunch too happily will(all laugh) despite him(all laugh) then says first marital status then each gym brat in hall of fame in the age range(all laugh) must be grilled and unless they budge i’ll visit them gladly for collections 1251th and so on IN HALLUCINATIONS(all laugh) and if you need support anyway(all laugh),the staffs inside must be threatened with penalties heaviest and give us infos without the whole world’s knowledge and all sorts of informations i want on 5 years which brats dared to go near..anyway(all laugh),sorry i’m just emotional(all laugh) the thing is i heard a certain gym from a city near Cerulian City whoose badge i have as Frontier symbol but that was from another leader hall of fame he was no more here now but then was grass gym hall of fame and the next leader cearted some fiasco there in Cerulian Mr Gower where is he now(all laugh) Simon gave the whereabouts then the incidents and we could see the anger(all laugh) said i see the screams are near-far-middle-far while angels and fairys roam around the picture of happy date series ending in eventual dumping(all burst into laughter,.) the anticipation of the DARK MOMENT despite LIGHTER FUN(all laugh) a Xormnuh for a day/if another is added with him where’s the way out of bay(all laugh,.)..that was the Team Rocket song with Mewtwo and Arceus in their heydays(all laugh) and bro has gone to Xormnuh and then literally later(all laugh)..we realized immediately ambulence might be needed(all laugh).. and then says fine then finally as we know the names of possible targets(all laugh) and i know 4 of them who woke up at the very dawn(all laugh) those targets must spit out everything they knew in their previous lives as well(all laugh) esle reminiscensing halluciantions deeds that are now erased but if poked are made to get them DARK(all laugh) so search of light themselves will spit out(all laugh and .)..basically look i want my Mist right now(all laugh) and can’t legally without knowing these informations cause i don’t want to hinder anyone that dares anyway(all laugh)..’  then tells only me that,’yeah finally the economy class of junior hall of fame(all laugh) Dave both you and me are new imports here(all laugh) i heard that my sweet flower..um..(all laugh) i heard that Misty isn’t alright and her behaviours has discomforted even Lance so if a brat broke-up then that chosen beau isn’t getting him for sure(all laugh) grill junior artists’ each unmarried or dumped brat(all laugh) we can easily playing sentimental cards get mingled(all laugh) and rest you know(all laugh)’ there was very few number of such unmarried brats that were men unfortunately(all laugh) they were told you see Mr Ash Ketchum wants to marry Ms Misty Waterflower from Cerulian City gym who is in gym leader’s hall of fame at water gyms in Kanto and was his first travel companion across his first 3 regions so shouldn’t we celebrate such an occasion knowing both the names(all laugh)’ i was told to see the expressions(all laugh) yeah these targets were chosen by him that means each(all laugh) then i filter then if i feel so i will send them to the anatomy master(all laugh)..each flew off to hell as soon as bro’s name is uttered(all laugh) and bro is dreaded even outside profession for that incredible press to differentiate between brother and beau(all laugh)..yeah throughout i had his Chu(all laugh)..and both his and mine were on my two shoulders so enough(all laugh)..so like this it went on and we started to hunt a few people down poor Sarah and family was threatened to death(all laugh) and all just his name and antics were enough if two Elite4s and the implication of Kalos with their money wasn’t enough(all laugh) and then in the mean time Lugias are beaued(all laugh) then he returns goes to the few chosen ones(all laugh) and that Frucient head head Cypras(all laugh) first Giratina and Ultranercozma was set upon him to show the life of Karapaskar and how Ultranercozma views it in from different types(all laugh) then next hour Gengleye was set upon him who compelled him  to tickle them for a full hour as he was taken to dark-fairy mix privacy(all laugh) then he was warned by means of anatomy to behave(all laugh) while he was migrating from one hallucination to other(all laugh) he said later well i was wrong and all ok but why did you suspend me that ghostly tickling hour succeeding the previous hour of suspense comedy movies(all laugh) were more than death in next life too(all laugh) and was in that level of hallucination for 2 hours with commentaries(all laugh) currently out as you know(all laugh) had to be cause said never saw suspence comedy(all laugh) then other men were there who was threatend and all which bro will himself say(all laugh) then while we do our thing bro went to Venturiastrog then of course Lugias came by to get Muked(all laugh) told me i said why didn't you grab that namecall legend(all laugh) said no just that fear of difference between the process and the procedure exists what you think and you're made to think the difference that is(all burst into laughter) i said well means Lugias are afraid to get insane then(all laugh) said yeah pretty much just so nice(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing)and then i was taken as a sidekick to pick up your death glares(all laugh) then later the fondling(all laugh) and then i was told about your life in full details only afterwards before that Team Rocket Actual(all laugh),by the way as usual Bulbasaur confirmed that i'm his bro later when he said Mr Duncun doesn't understand the difference between hence and thus(all burst into laughter) so he's your bro which means hence is the reasoning chain and thus is the way to prove the siblinglinghood so i don't understand that hence the relation is natural thus i'm his bro(all laugh) and yeah,i know the Marshadow,Pangoro and Sableye dictum with Sceptilic,Crawdaunted and Glalic confirmations that Drew was shoved down with to his utmost disdain(all laugh) and Trace humanly observed out(all laugh)...but to be honest Gary and all of you were so happy to have me and made me your own in no time but this still excludes the in bro's words wax-Onix(all laugh) i later infact asked Mrs Slate of this simplicity(all laugh) said you see boy,it's just that the type differences if you handle for too long becomes own(all laugh) and i realized just so nice(all laugh) and Zara was confirmed by Bronzong actually(all burst into laughter) Bronzong by the end was jovial as well not at this level who yesterday told me this faculty of thought is why you battle(all burst into laughter) cause you want to think about yourself but why(all burst into laughter) see Mr Duncun,this idea that you can think is why since the beginning till very now you've never been able to get over the duality of choise(all laugh) thus you're still as much unhappy as when you were just born aren't you(all burst into laughter) i fled the scene as soon as i could(all laugh)Bronzong was given to her as protection in ending days and his report was Zara was so happy to hear his words that didn't stop laughing but didn't try to think furthur hence(all laugh) this he told me before my marriage and i then said man how can you depend so much on translators(all laugh) said well if not them then not me either(all laugh) i then itself realized then he was like cousin and i realized a great cousin indeed(all laugh),anyway then he creats that circus in Cerulian(all laugh) and gets to sis and does what he does to tell the whole world that the water empress was married for 19 years but the emperor was busy in last 5 perfecting the gift of hallucination lectures(all laugh) then later told me of the break-in(all laugh) saying my Mist just needs a date to herself propose me(all laugh) then finally the day before called Zara to know her ring model(all burst into laughter) she could barely stay alive(all laugh) then she gave the phone to me and i said just the one with Gyarados marked on the stone(all laugh) yeah,yeah,Gyarados(all laugh),why is it that Misty is so much sought after name yeah,Gyarados(all laugh) why is it that she is a great gym leader yeah,Gyarados(all laugh) don't mingle pokemons here it's um..(all laugh),then both me and Zara clapped saying finally the Gengar has become Ash Ketchum again to get a specific type of flower(all laugh) yeah,yeah,Waterflower(all laugh) suits the gym type so aptly and that damn show WHICH ONLY I WILL SEE NOW(all laugh) then we realized better to not delay cause hospitals may have to be informed otherwise(all lugh) but later we came to know pokemons not involved means they won't question him dring the date that's all cause then they are sis to him(all laugh),i later asked bro we only saw may be 1 hour atmost with a few then they did full lie detection and curing people with Arceus and Mewtwo combined for 1 hour but the person didn't stay sane after the treatment(all laugh) and here these pests are way way higher than anything and then they were like 60 of so many types even the non psychics at the most crucial times(all laugh) then so many hours of that level of human emotion how did they manage and how to be honest how was my sis managed(all laugh),yeah just told them when you can't get us both or either just try to foist your own ideas of us on us with varying force to save yourselves as much so that you are trying to save me but can only do so if i'm alive at physical body still along with you,and this teaching took 7 days continuous sutle body at farm as you saw most delicate states i was at never slept then that was done later at home dozing mom off for 2.5 hours and hallucinating brats away from my den(all laugh) and all of these were done to get brats most jovial cause they work against my wishes most times as you know(all laugh) which is why both me and your sis along with them are still alive actually(all laugh) i said yeah,hence human doctors weren't preffered in your case(all laugh) and you know why none other than Dr Zyko at Unova could've saved bro he said never saw anyone letting his brats go to this level no wonder he greeted me saying blood and sweat(all laugh) nerves were as good as anything but they were almost totally disconnected from physical planes(all laugh) and actually Dr Zyko was informed too due to Cilan only who alone in Unova could've kept pace with Tyranitar(all laugh) anyway,then after his marriage on that midnight(all laugh) bro told me Cerulians tried their hands at mobbing me abjectly failed(all laugh) just will give the ring today after explaining my activites to her family and then playing a prank on them(all laugh) then said prank cause her family is too serious about life now in illusion in these days(all burst into laughter) then his brief introduction of the real first sight marriage story of his and my sister-in-law and then says was confused that Misty Waterflower wasn’t my Mist but it wasn’t so(all laugh) i said then still is Misty a girl(all laugh) eternally never(all burst into laughter) my Mist is just my soulmate my Mist don’t mingle the psychophysical ideas in family it’s impolite(all burst into laughter) so i said well give the ring immediately or else we have to call an ambulence(all laugh) and looking forward to tomorrow(all laugh) then Zara was told by me who was too overjoyed said shouldn’t we call i said it’s late night(all laugh) and our sister-in-law should’nt be associeted with any gender(all laugh) Zara was laughing so much said finally the Gengar has been abjectly Mistyfied(all laugh) then finally next day Mr Oak Mr Oak comes(all laugh) no really sorry Gary but that should be the name now(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “no Dave don’t you have any vacancies there at Lomstom(all laugh)...”
David(laugh) : “well i’m told to use protection too along with Zara(all laugh)...anyway then Gary comes and a huge number of papers are there with us and he brings double on urgency(all laugh) then we go on about what we know and he says the personal side of bro finally and then Professor comes and so much then finally we meet my sister-in-law and then Brock was threatened in here later(all laugh) and then the next day but when before Brock,Tracey went there that scene(all laugh) was introduced to us in all professional way then was told all are the veil to veil the human fox gently(all laugh) and so on and i was just so overjoyed to have my full family here as well as is Zara and everything aunty has been my aunty and mom as well and just so happy to spend the rest of my life here but no i’ll be start again with Gili(all laugh) then follow all including my own (all laugh) through unreal hallucinations(all lugh) but really for all of my career and bro you as well surely we want Jasu,McShin and gang and none else each day don’t we(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “ well then we should follow Tauros(all laugh) this earth,this sun/i want more human for fun(all laugh)/this hunger to cherish Elite4(all laugh)/ please tell them be responsible more and more(all laugh)..surely better Dave no doubt as Persy beau agrees(all laugh)..but of all Dave we just want him..Jasu(all laugh)..”
David(laugh) : “yeah that’s for sure Kanto just is needed to be told that,’yes Sir,we understand your inability at present to help us and it’s alright Sir but if atleast another time in 9 days you could consider(all laugh)’..that will be enough(all laugh)..or our competition have more Weaviles than Gyaradoes entering(all laugh)..anyway,i better go now else the my Weavile will breach cover at my home(All laugh)..bye all..(all bye reciprocate and all)....”
....................................
(2 days later,night,middle)
Ash(laugh) : “well then so i come out of Lumburg beauty parlour unsctaed finally after knowing 15 times more than i wanted(all laugh)..and i just can’t supress the laugh i had in my mind listening to the account of the men it was so funny(all laugh)..but i’ve never roasted it so i will now(all laugh)...cause my Gyarados is too much dangerously 16(all laugh)..”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “in your face you namecalled naive crook(all laugh)...who’se your beau(all laugh) bring that namecalled Mantine singer(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “well Brock told me wisely pointing out that the demon-boy is too radical for life(all burst into laughter)..”
Brock(laugh) : “well the trouble for me is that i’ve never seen such politely friendly brats ever(all laugh) and now whole contest system has been foisted upon me and now again back to all square to to designations rechanges(all laugh)”
Ash(laugh) : “well my SOURECS(all laugh) meanig a Mr Bret Arnold,specialist in information extraction hall of fame in Sinnoh(all laugh) informed the beautiful men via Dave from before so now the men know and anyway prepared their grand ovation(all laugh) and all then gets into coffee after lunch(all laugh),’um..we guess our comrades there(all laugh)?’,’well no comrades will be separtely handled don’t bother(all laugh) i wish to know the phenomena of a name that was associeted with a certain Ms Misty Waterflower(all laugh) and for that matter it’s surprizing that how a random stranger like me got associeted with that name(all laugh)’,’um..can we take our time(all laugh)’,’yeah sure but i still don’t understand the logic behind leaving a region out(all laugh) then jumping at the HQ of all places(all laugh) which has i don’t know 1000 mega-Zekroms(all laugh)..cause they cherish them so much(all laugh)..man that brat is something...cause i don’t understand hunting for men who are in no contact what-so-ever with even managers(all laugh) for 3 years no matter the public gospel(all laugh) says..’..’um..well then definitely we will require time(all laugh)..you see there’s a certain school(all burst into laughter)..’,’um..sorry but that’s like 22 years now(all burst into laughter)..’,’no no see we know as much as you know(all burst into laughter),cause Viridian Forest Lake is universally known(all laugh) and that’s what we’re talking about(all laugh)’...by the way this is after they gave their career and current personal life of all(all laugh) briefly in 6/7 minutes(all laugh) and was ADVISED(all burst into laughter) just said that look men don’t get emotional life that and don’t go to Unova with only one Altaria(all laugh) cause each Zekrom preys one(all laugh) atleast travel as a trainer get a few Zekroms and then go(all laugh) anyway starts,’school this bench was reserved for this(all burst into laughter) and then the Gyarados did this and that(all laugh) all beyond formalities were scoffed off boys and girls boys extremely harshly and girls even more so(all laugh) and so on but whole world knew how the Gyarados best-beau-husband-friend would be(all laugh) and so on and then which subjected fetched which marks(all laugh)..i said but marks(all laugh),no that’s the key(all burst into laughter) and so on then young flower dream phenomena it’s detailed Cerulian analysis(all laugh) how if the Gyarados wasn’t there nobody would’ve bothered(all laugh)..i said but that’s disrespectful(all laugh)..’no you see that’s the gateway(all burst into laughter)...then finally i get to know what my sweet Gyarados flower was doing...men said everyone knew about Ash Ketchum(all laugh) well Irene knew(all laugh) and yeah,they asked me Kane is yourschoolmate right(all laugh),i said,yeah too much bonhomie(all laugh) they said,well she told us what you said after McShin cup(all laugh) that your Feraligator was taught to self discover the way to surmount his own existential despondency(all burst into laughter) which he compelled the Team Rocket boss to do that is(all alugh)and then the Sinnoh trophy and all understood that Gyarados is atleast not battle starved(all laugh) and after Sinnoh we were told that all got you on your Chu and you said this idea of electricity is this invention of the power of nature that has it's own visible and tangible effects which makes an electric type egotistical and Pikachu is a pokemon that can misbehave cause he feels insecured as Pichu is like normal little pokemon and Raichu is extremely strong as we know but the middle stage is a hard one as it appears to the middle stage(all laugh) and hence they must be made aware of the idea of appreciation of art and literature(all burst into laughter) that is why we do things despite knowing that the result isn't staying constant it's an insatiability inside that forces us to do and we may become better with this idea of self less ness but at the end of the day why defend own actions cause your natural state dictates you don't want to do anything to being with(all laugh) hence this idea of art is ingrained in that fact that we must get that same joy of inaction into this thus a Chu may be asked to detroy the food given to him mentally by extracting the most out of it mentally not physically(all burst into laughter) then he will get starved and will complain that his master is torturing him then he will be told this art of torturing is so maddening but why(all burst into laughter) then he will realize its his own ego that has been hit so he will become thoughtful of why this ego is so maddening(all laugh) and he will get understand this art of ego that is it only gives a hallucination of more while the actual is less(all laugh) thus he will then try to find the less to make it more which he will fail to do cause the less too is ego of insecurity contrasting the more(all laugh) so ego is self contradictory now he will find this art of ego and will get rid of it to surpass his own being then returning to use his idea of ego to manipulate the hallucinations and hence giving an idea to the opponent that he is intriguing thus the opponent can't be assured of himself cause he's at bay with himself and Chu as well thus this idea of battle starvation comes if you want to win don't win at all,if you want to be don't be at all,if you want yourself don't be the self at all(all burst into laughter) oh yes,this idea too is to be crossed out,thank you(all burst into laughter),now this time you were pressed more cause your then girlfriend this gym leader was pressed so she complained to you we guess(all laugh),i said,well i doen't remember the occasion but i can tell you the method is to forget everything as much as possible and try to get rid of the idea of being along with the idea of everything else cause you can see this very being is the root of the being(all laugh) hence self contradictory thus is false and we perceiving that surely isn't that to being with(all laugh) thus just glide through into the concentration of bliss from happiness what my Yveltal says as you know(all burst into laughter) the idea is honesty of morality of honesty of ethical honesty of ethics of honesty(all laugh) i guess you know my Guzzlord too all were tested(all laugh),said yeah,due to fortunes(all burst into laughter) i said,yeah he repeats these many times cause that is the only thing to do nothing else so being honest to the being itself that i'll see through it is all that can be done the idea of seeing through is the little happinesses and then the bliss the more concentration and so on hence always cogitating over that by all means as much as possible is what is there all about that is and hence my bunch does a bit as much as they can but your bunchs may do the same if you do that is it's universal(all laugh) they said,yeah may give a thought later(all laugh) but this was told to them as well(all laugh) and this was around the time when you left for Unova and this all heard and was propagated and we realized this isn't a sane person's idea at all(all laugh) cause whole world is a philosophical endeavour to them thus they don't know who they are and where they are at which age of what evolutional type(all laugh) this the gym leader said is the reason why your bunch are never sane since day one of your career and the other way around the most so it's just the circulating thing hence rather like a fluke but that word itself has no meaning cause none says that if they are born as Kyurem(all burst into laughter) i said yeah pretty true(all laugh) but appreciation is one thing too much of it is another cause after all the tickets weren't legal(all laugh) said,no even if caught the positions would've thrown them off cause surely we could pay too much(all laugh) i said,yeah absolutely(all laugh) but for that reaches in certain places were needed(all laugh) said well your contact was there(all burst into laughter) i said but that was just the general not personal(all laugh) and furthermore i was being accused of being everywhere as well just one more and then given the positions would've insinuated Team Rocket only would'nt it(all laugh) said yeah may be the trouble would've been solved after all if we just said check your Tauros(all laugh) cause he would've said like hunger of the hungry and that of the not so are in essence same independent to time and space but why(all brust into laughter) i said,yeah hence they rather spared us for themselves(all laugh) they said yeah
for us we only saw Gyaradoes that was still comprehensible by not being so(all laugh) but a true Gengar(all burst into laughter) i said i guess you know a few people there at Cerulian whom i know as well hence i'm intrigued by you people cause i guess among that group you were revered rather(all laugh) and hence my amusement as well why would out of blue people jump not the fire but way worse at Huntelion(all laugh) they said,well the contrast of Gyarados that is(all laugh) i said yeah,i realize it hence the illusion even more(all laugh) they said,yeah pretty much hence tantalizing(all burst into laughter) i said,yeah excellent exactly not if the subject is HUMAN(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) and the trouble deepens only if genders are involved ain't it(all laugh) they said yeah,which never appeared in the true case and hence the truth(all laugh) i said yeah life is strange(all laugh) like Gengar(all laugh) they said,yeah if only the equality is better described at certain places(all laugh) i said,well if the attempt is made except the realiztaions of those who say it's hard isn't it cause you don't get that idea(all laugh) they said yeah but this attitude that our soulmates have..(all burst into laughter) i said,no it's a matter of emotion due to the existence in the prsent state of being of a particular gender that appears cause there's another and that is there cause of the idea of gender to being with but the unfoldment is from natural to subtle so it must be given the respect(all laugh) they said yeah that's true but these sort of accessories are great(all burst into laughter) i said,well this from my Heracross actually(all burst into laughter) i looked at their breeding season and they are like ever another(all laugh) now if you translate that to our plane it's just hence honestly why bother(all laugh) now men were so happy(all burst into laughter) said,everywhere then(all laugh) i said yeah hence life companionship the rest is the rest but the essence is hence usage in right proportion only looking and finding the present as my bunch says not gently that is(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) they almost hugged me to death(all laugh) said,hence why bother at all just the idea of self as much then the other way around as same so is the reciprocation and hence actually no difference at all(all laugh) men after this almost fainted in too much glee(all laugh) so i said yeah this and this book most engaging(all burst into laughter) said well,those are infact theories we only read a few excerpts from internet heard a few and so on but through representations influenced certain press conferences we realize(all laugh) but do you know Mrs Irene Cobter Halmsly(all burst into laughter) i said,yeah due to the Halmsly part i guee is this question(all laugh) said yeah,ever an extremely nice person and the very few the Gyarados trusts actually if not only cause the Gyarados dictum says i'll ride on your shoulders pulling your hairs and ears and namecall you(all laugh) if you retort then i'll go to my best friend(all laugh,Ash and Misty smile at each other) and if he's not there why is he not there he should be(all laugh) this is the philosophy of personal life of our Mist Gyaradosy flower(all laugh) well this is most Gyaradosy but the her sisters are extremely dangerous as well(all laugh) the sweet little big sis says Gary Oak must be Mr Oak professionally but shut up now you're at home(all laugh) so that swinging is something(all laugh) exactly why Mr Oak says yeah i'm so sweet but hush!professionalism! this is Mr Oak(all laugh) hence ever is trapped(all laugh) so then the elder expressive sister says,i'll go fully expressive without any limits,you crook(all laugh) manage me or else(all laugh) so the crook says,this idea of being HUMAN just so naive(all laugh) thus gets in trap by everyone(all laugh) but then(all laugh) AH!SENTIMENT IS ABOUT BEING HUMAN!(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs)..so the eldest big sis dictates that i'll be most reponsible with everything more than needed of course(all laugh) hence i'll get mental strains hey you jackal(all laugh) thus finally the jackal says,observe,if only time erect the years up,jump,repeat(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) hence the Daisyl ever gets in traps(all laugh) this whole family barring me including extensions just so naive(all laugh)..surely i actually want to ask the epitome of naivety this(all laugh) really Brock am i naive(all laugh).."
Brock(laugh) : "well if i say the legendary reply twice handed out to Trace and Team then what happens(all laugh).."
Misty(smile,same pose) : "i'll teach Flores to pull Foster's hairs(all burst into laughter)"
Ash(laugh) : "just so naive(all laugh)"
Brock(laugh) : "man,if mom sees this and knows the teacher i'll be expelled(all laugh)"
Violet(laugh) : "hence it's AH!BOULDER!BOULDER!(all laugh) and for you Gengar(all laugh) it's said none sane asks a complete stranger that too a girl who is most Gyaradosy as was seen by him the day before that,'um,Misty,you will travel with me now officially registered but don't mind my words this i must say for the sake of myself most that you see being of my gender there is an idea of that of yours(all burst into laughter) so i mean if you want to reconsider then please it's not a trouble..'(all laugh) and Mist barely managed to not attack the Gengar then and there(all laugh) and this is just so naive(all laugh) and then she told us my Ash..um..my friend..um..my travel compnaion Ash(all laugh) is very caring don't worry he's so sweet um.. i mean nice(all laugh)..' and said,he takes care of me and also he observes me whole day(all burst into laughter) so we thought what lunatics have ushurped our baby and how dare that naive crook let it happen(all laugh) actually we didn't intervene only cause none other than the philosopher was around(all laugh) then i ask him who is that damn brat(all laugh) kick him out of your group(all laugh) he said like,um..Viol..i mean Ms Violet(all laugh) don't worry the observations are more than well reciprocated(all laugh) and the pest himself tells me that a girl is our travel compnaion yet look she's still a girl in this idea how does it go(all burst into laughter) then i was taken aback cause this brat if really wants what he's talking about then he's hindering himself(all laugh) then i heard this and was intrigued as well cause this case wasn't fitted with expressions(all laugh) as was Dase cause this can't be removed by sentiments(all laugh) and i was 21,Dase 23(all laugh) so Lil at 19 said,ask his opinions on beauty(all brust into laughter) then later Brock says,this pest is extremely abstruse to other girls(all laugh) but seems doesn't want to admit that your sis is one(all burst into laughter) then we were so scared(all burst into laughter) then Mist was summoned and she said SHUT UP!(all laugh) it's cause i look way better than everyone including you all combined(all burst into laughter) and my Ash only..um..(all laugh) then it was learnt that the pest is only interested about one girl but that unfortunately had to be our baby sis(all laugh) who we found out wasn't a girl(all burst into laughter) later after abstract training methods and all came up and Mist was observed day and night and we realized it's like a Daisyl observing her(all laugh) so the Daisyl said too much bonhomie(all laugh) i scoffed at her saying greatest caring husband and Lil said hum,ask her how many flower boquests(all laugh) no pest does what you did in the first month to your wife unless both are pokemons(all laugh) Mist said pesters me sometimes and all but just no reactions at all except the observation(all laugh) only later she was playing big sis then said yeah now too dreamy(all laugh)..but then the two words came(all laugh) and this all suggests that even a Gengar who greets people by saying so(all laugh) is just so naive(all laugh).."
Ash(laugh) : "well,i was eaten up day 0(all laugh) still said that to her cause as i said Mist is Mist to me so it all was just so naive(all laugh) and i didn't want her to take up so much strain in that forest due to me the naturality that is(all laugh) actually wanted to marry her then and there by saying you're not a girl to me never in any time(all laugh)..anyway,then back to AH!BEAUTY!BEAUTY!(all laugh),so they continued to inquire my knowledge on my familiarity with my friend's wife's name(all laugh) and was saying that yeah Irene you know ever in touch with us despite everything and since the beginning says both she and her husband Kane are fed abstract ideas like approaching a sick and mad Tentacruel with this question the sickness of the poison does it harm the quality at all Mr TentaCruel(all burst into laughter) infact these helped us as well we guess the whole world knows about these things(all laugh) i said,well,the recodings are a facility that helps the memory by relieveing the pressure that it already has with this burden of specificity of existential reality of the present being(all laugh) said yeah,hence your presentation today on Palkia,Salamence and Latios has been recorded(all laugh) i said,well all understand my words and meanings so well it's not that it's imcomprehensible or something rather the exact opposite(all laugh) like flamethrow the last time i said this was i guess 18 years ago(all burst into laughter),so why so much bonhomie(all laugh) said,well first all understand your words but never the intentions cause why would anyone tell these to wild brats while dining at their home(all laugh) second expect them to scoff at him saying lad how many backlogs(all burst into laughter) then third and this is what you did as we heard before that you said the girl that's not so is considerable as a friend or if more then family if my bunch agrees with me only like Scrafty(all burst into laughter) we say this name cause this one on being tested told the researchers this idea to learn only fuels your ignorence cause it's the duality that's you yourself or your family hence you see i'm dual type too in appearence so any chance that(all burst into laughter)..they fled the scene cause family is still ok no matter how horrifying that would be(all laugh) but this pest wants to enter you that is will fondle your nerves with her realizations on dual philosophy to make you permanently decapacitated mentally(all laugh) hence this duality of gender if no more there they can enter the family recognizing the appearence of genders only as an appearence(all laugh) and all these tell us why you never said flamethrow cause that's an idea so an hindrence to rality of it(all laugh) thus your battles were as abstruse as they have been(all laugh) cause while all battle they actually are at philosophical conferences(all laugh) and you were clearing backlogs in training(all laugh) thus all these made us realize what a Gengar is in HUMAN form(all laugh) this the Gyarados herself told us,we once wanted to train with her to see and learn from the methods this was actually before we left for Kanto and then she did agree but we saw great methods of teaching her students(all laugh) too unimanigably perceptive and self established but seemed very dissapointed each passing moment then stopped we regardless of ideas asked what's the matter cause no matter what we had 2 leagues and a Kyogre which Mr Oak opined with an indifferent face veiling irritation as Mr Oak was on-the-fly intentionally(all laugh) to be of that type being not of that type cause that type was of that type(all laugh) she said,no it's ok then did continue a bit more but in the end said it's all one way you know how to know what they think(all laugh)so we got the bonhomie part(all laugh)cause by then we with the whole world knew what was going on in Unova atleast(all laugh) hence realized yeah well this attunement gives her that unique skill but this whole method seemed to be only reflecting someone in opposition(all laugh) cause never tried to counter much unless absolutely necessary out of total surprize but surprizing her is almost impossible unless a certain Snorlax turns up(all laugh) but anyway why are we talking about her skills in details to the opposing refection anyway(all laugh) i said,well before t hat it's rather strange this intuition we have being trainers about other people isn't it(all laugh) they laughed and said,yeah indeed hence also the philosophy suits to remind us whom we handle(all laugh) then i said,well you see when we started neither she nor me had any idea where we were hence went into Viridian Forest without a proper map(all laugh) and then again never learnt what to do at all in terrking life and so on(all laugh) i had some knowledge on compasses and all but you understand i wasn't satisfied with the accuracy level hence went to next gym rather than the airport to return for a brief visit to Cerulian(all laugh) to abduct a certain Mist flower that is(all laugh) then as natual propensities grow i had my contering methods all along and she was as ever too Gyaradosy as you know(all laugh) then we met a certain Doctor Slate(all laugh) whoose name is better not mentioned for your well being from Salamences including him(all laugh) Salamencian life dictates the idea of killing AH!JUST SO NAIVE!(all laugh) hence they will not cease before they kill your sanity completely(all laugh) this insinuation to Gengarian philosophy meant men jumped up 10 feets to suddenly appear through to next floor where people fled the scene cause they saw a Salamence digging upwards with that type of wing(all burst into laughter) then men came down with mega Salamencian wing arc(all laugh) and each of the top floor persons of course saying brought each brat together(all laugh) so somehow i stayed alive without laughing cause Gengeley was behind me to save me(all laugh) then i said,so Doctor Slate helped us with everything we literally rode on his back(all laugh) then he was very nice of course to both of us and then we relaized what we did but she as you see too infatuated with me since the first meeting so obsessively did the exact opposite that i did to enlighten me upon her feelings on that type of similar ways that we were travelling(all laugh) so she picked up this anticipation method and of course that's who she really is too perceptive about everything but too sweet to do anything about it unless necessary hence never realized the 5117 th type of handshake(all laugh,Ash laughs at Misty who smiles at him same pose both) so she could anticipate things that i can never do at all and hence my style was all about conutering and her the exact opposite cause she never needed to counter almost always and when had to was a bit predictable that's the way to beat her in battles unless you can overpower her in the blitz that my sis once managed(all laugh) and the record of our family in-between is Mist vs May,blitzs total 3 of 8+5 two rounds in 13 minutes and the record is in 8 minutes,Mist2-1May and in 5 minutes Mist0-0May,all were tied(all laugh) then Dave and Mist battle innumerable times so don't know(all laugh),Mist's record at hall of fame now faces Dave each week(all laugh) twice(all laugh) the second line-up is Jelliogredos(all laugh) hence time saving(all laugh) and Dave's brats learn these then foist these upon people hence his record is one loss in like 100 matches(all laugh) and that too was 6 months back at Sinnoh(all laugh) and then there was SPEW(all burst into laughter) man this name and tone gets the brat in traps each time(all laugh),Drew's record is 8 minutes Mist0-0Shrew and in 5 minutes Mist1-0Spew(all laugh) so only 1 win for Mist in 5 minutes of all limits(all laugh) well none can beat Drew at 8 minutes(all laugh) so i told Drew man what is with you that you can't win(all laugh),yeah,FAMILIAL INFATUATION(all burst into laughter) so i said then just SPEW(all laugh)..man,Drew is Drew you know as Spew(all laugh) like Cili(all laugh)..Ash,why are they ordering Gibles in hoards(all laugh) anyway,then i said,so you see if you allow this Gyarados to have her ways she will ride on your shoulders to pull your ears and hairs that you namecall immediately tell my Ash that i um..he..um..(all laugh) too sweet Gyarados(all laugh,Ash and Misty smile at each other in same pose)..thus she is great at anticipation and thus her style always understanding what she is doing and hence what she will do next she deletes the opponent thus and whole thing is about plan after plan hence becomes so confident with each passing moment and thus the frowns and scowls and smiles all are so much more sweet sweet(all laugh,Ash laughs at Misty who smiles at him in same pose) so you see it's so hard for me to describe my wife professionally(all laugh) then they said,then we guess it's like start with one the basic then grow in confidence as you know your pokemons too well and attacks and all but she isn't ever studious you may know(all laugh) i said,yeah intellectual(all laugh) they laughed and said,that was the only word she ever knew at school(all laugh) i said,still do(all laugh),and that is about yeah the basics she studied well and was the most ardent disciple of none other than Dr Skechit and Doctor Slate so you realize the knowledge base(all laugh) crookedly foxing(all laugh) and then again had a Mr Oak to review her intuitions on-the-fly as Gary Oak(all laugh) so she knows about the basics too well they said,and his teachers know this at the cost of themselves we guess(all laugh) i said yeah my whole bunch was tamed first processed second and woken third,first by Doctor Slate,then Dr Skechit and finally Mr Oak as you see hence Mr Oak doesn't get his degree either the researches being of that type(all laugh) they said,yeah,hence they are so renouned but looks rather dejected all time(all laugh) we guess effects of () of course(all laugh) cause we saw Mrs Oak later and Mrs Oak(all laugh) looked very same so we realized it(all laugh) i said,yeah,hence none else in the world can be who they are hence the family(all laugh) then they said,but that is the basics on pokemons and how to handle them and the care but the actual battle we knew many of her contacts including Sabrina of course(all laugh),he..he..left me to marry me later(all laugh,Ash laughs at Misty who smiles at him in same pose),Sabrina later told me,boy tackle your wife rightly(all laugh) i said well my bunch does(all laugh),but the main drive and mental food as usual is you we guess(all laugh) i said yeah,just too fond(all laugh) used to not talk about that with me and me the same after her initial days here but you see we both needed break(all laugh) they said,yeah that was both of yours real training we realized(all laugh) then i said,just like Gyarados yeah(all laugh) but do you know what is the Gyaradosian gospel(all burst into laughter,cheers for PLAYBOY,all laugh even more,Ash laughs a lot,Misty smiles at him same pose) men became too much excited(all laugh) said yeah yeah that was the mystery(all laugh) i said but you yourselves have one(all laugh) no he is good but just not philosophically sound(all burst into laughter) i said yeah realized(all laugh) then i said Gyaradosy dictum of life is about plain and simple blind stubborness over anything they like(all laugh,Ash laughs and at Misty who smiles at him in same pose) thus the sweetly ponytailed Gyarados must be asked 'attitude?'(all laugh,Ash laughs at Misty and Misty smiles at him both same pose) then she will hug me too dangerously just like Gyarados(all laugh) so then to actually get a Gyarados woken this natural rage of theirs must be upended they are like Tyranitar(all laugh) or Solgaleo yeah(all laugh) or Cobalion,Groudon,Heatran,Rhyperiar,Golem,Magmorter,Charizard,Terrakion and so on(all laugh) mind it none are dragons(all laugh) they said yeah we know the topmost among them to be safe ourselves as their trainers themselves have to know(all laugh),Ash why authority is telling me to inspect Huntelion each month(all laugh) then anyway,i said Gyarados dictum thus says we are too powerful hence just the dormant dragonic nature of might and pride comes out too much and being at water are being infested all over the world thus a real meance everywhere in even big rivers(all laugh) then if a wild herd of Gyarados is faced they must be asked of their opinions on the difference of spontaneous vs natural(all burst into laughter) then they will be suspicious of you cause you are with your bunch but they don't say anything they are rather indifferent though they consist of Phampy and Chimchar mid ocean(all laugh) so they will be become thoughtful as to this is natural for them to get scared and us to eat them up(all laugh) but the spontaneity for us tells us they are hindrence to our pursuit of that mightiest perfection so that we hold sway over ourselves(all laugh) hence actually we don't really want them but us at this junction a few choised ones that has the material to go further into this discussion will surround your boat of ship(all laugh) then you will recall your pokemons(all laugh) else they will be killed cause they are hindering the naturality thus making them become spontaneous(all laugh) then you will question them to show the oneness between male and female(all burst into laughter) they will become very thoughtfull cause they won't be able to as all the difference is only valid from one point never can be generalized by no means(all laugh) hence this idea will ever cling onto them hindering them to show the oneness(all laugh) cause if they talk about physical oneness they are trapped,mental oneness still trapped then emotional and even the subtle bodies still trapped cause the idea persists(all laugh) hence they should go further(all laugh) and hence they realize this rage is not even to get the breeding season and food and so on and then finally you will question them to give your their views on society and freedom(all burst into laughter) then they will realize from previous two that society is thus useless to any aspect just the freedom from everything makes them too happy hence the society is just the expression of that in sharing cause all similar in ideas hence the share and it's never about power and all cause of the lack of being(all laugh) cause that's real freedom hence with all these they will realize that this rage is the upended version of that maddening tune(all laugh) hence a choised one will by himself go into the pokeball for you(all laugh) but yeah will try to dictate your pace in psychic channels and if not allowed will try to teach you directly by taking you mid ocean trying to force you to creat dragon rage whirl while telling you this now veils the hallucinated the idea of throwing a piece of paper to your classmate as he opens it finds the words BLOOD AND SWEAT(all burst into laughter) ever a grand hallucination to be shaded down human(all laugh).."
Tracey(laugh) : "i'll throw your brats out if they and you teach these(all laugh)"
Misty(smile,same pose) : "then the paper will have pictures of cough(all burst into laughter)"
Ash(laugh) : "so you see what Gyaradoses do if too Gyaradosy(all laugh).. then i said hence you see that is Gyarados at full potential but about her trainer well,yeah we had discussions a very few just wanted to listen to a few things i say,and you know i ever ask a question on a certain thing then the ideas come to me on how to awake that idea of freedom from within then i become happy so the languages come which my bunch validates or rejects then i have to sit for supplimentaries(all laugh) and she listened to a few then the rest was just me for her and thus the ideas for her of me professionally as well and is a great trainer just you know with that style it's very much like how the great Laura was,she spoke with her once and pretty much like her and you know her 7,6-1(all laugh) so it's like her but do you want me to tell you about your style(all laugh) they said,yeah sure along with the fact that how she of all people viewed your methods cause the whole world tried their hands at your methods and the result is that their bunch turned on them(all laugh) why is that as well(all laugh) i said,well about he you see we were in a relationship for a very very long time and thus it was all too natural for us she and me know each other's style too well but she actually knew since Unova what happened she doesn't know much just a bit and the current level of my bunch she doesn't know at all to her then relief that was(all laugh) then she did the questioning a bit but you know that was basic that all do like are you hungry(all burst into laughter) they said,yeah unlike Bayleaf that is(all laugh) i said,yeah certainly(all laugh) but do all 106 too well known(all laugh) they said,well according to the gentleman,Mr Oak and Doctor Slate definitely they are rather benchmarks in insanity currently and the trouble is that neither are they stopping at any mark nor is it shown that any other wild brat or the bunch of anyone else can't become like them hence a hew of fear surrounds you(all laugh) i said well i realize the fear is just that of Gengar(all laugh) they said yeah only who knows but no matter how much they try others don't listen(all laugh) i said,well it takes time(all laugh) but then yeah back to styles yeah she did ask a few questions and all but was like me and her we never bothered about profession in between us then and all then no it's just a matter of perceptions you see some people tried to copy me or even get inspired those who inspired me or got that from me still can't copy me cause the problem as we all know in psychic channels you can't be that and expect a result hence the failure of many people trying to copy then they said,yeah people are inspired by you or inspires you may be but none are like this so we realize flukes but is it just that(all laugh),i said well look you surely know what my Kyurem says(all laugh) they said,yeah only appearning as fluke to the born actually nothing is specified cause it doesn't matter at all at the level of Gengar if two are same or all or none still the individual joy is too maddening as they say(all laugh) to look at anything else hence no secrecy from you and hence others are not at this level cause they are responsible in the thought that they are born(all laugh) i said,well you see we are only one profession in the world out of may be 50000 in only ours as a whole(all laugh) they said,yeah here only we're saying cause it's just so absurd that the first rule of pokemons is that don't let them tame you(all laugh) and you have ever revolted against it as directed by Shiftree(all laugh) so we realize that somehow it's just about as Kyurem says who she is just nothing else(all laugh) i said,yeah absolutely you see it doesn't matter cause so many people adore me love me have great affection they never feel any discomfort with my level or skill and personality and antics and so on like Mr Skechit,starting beau Marill,psychothrombonosis expert especially when is used to jump alongside into the Oceans infested with Sharpedo,Gyarados,Kyogre and Palkia(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) thus you see it's rather who they are that is all about it they are happier than me surely with pokemons not fondling their nerves own pokemons that is(all laugh) but from own then you get more well versed of course to explore the wild hence know many grand philosophers who don't submit their thesis unless their own mood appeases them to cause they are different to them hence the thesis(all laugh).."
Tracey(laugh) : "you brat don't spoil my poor pokekids too(all laugh)"
Ash(laugh) : "no i heard Edin told Hector that he wants a Grimer as prize(all burst into laughter),anyway(laugh,all laugh) then they said yeah we see why indeed Kyurem is so dangerous(all laugh) then they said what about our styles(all laugh) i said well,you are too polite and just very nice men all around and emotional for life(all laugh) what Kyogre told me that is(all laugh) i asked him mate do you relize why you are a Kyogre(all burst into laughter) he said yeah that's what my master calls me by only during attacks(all burst into laughter) this means he is well tamed sweet little kid(all laugh) but you see emotion is right as well no wonder i understand everything and it's alright which is not the case with this emotion to suddenly jump onto own soulmate not giving her enough time to settle with her relizations and hence overbearing happiness(all laugh) men almost ate me up with sussage(all laugh) then said,yeah hence studying Gengarian ways to achieve the same(all burst into laughter) i said,yeah best of luck(all laugh) then they said,well after we went to Unova we got our Kyogre trying to dictate our us(all laugh) so then the illusions broke off for us cause we realized if you have been so much adored by the concerened gym leader and you still are a Gengar(all laugh) then Gengar is the reality(all burst into laughter) hence we went into self introspection and realized the illusion as so hence out of it but then we also heppen to be good friends with Irene you see(all laugh) i said,yeah she's a water specialist doctor in profession and then an extremely sweet and nice person so yeah like rather auspicious company(all burst into laughter) so(laugh,all laugh) they were laughing for ages hearing this(all laugh) then i said yeah,but i just hope they haven't or won't in future disturb you with reports(all laugh) they said no no that's ok they understand that cause we've been so much happier now(all laugh) i said exactly why the soulmates don't want you to hover around the past just to show the Gastlic evolution(all laugh) they were dissapointed(all burst into laughter) said being a gengar it's hard to hold onto things that is it clouds and strains the mind(all burst into laughter) i said yeah i've time(all burst into laughter) they said yeah it's also the anniversary for us you see(all burst into laughter) i said yeah this was the date(all burst into laughter) and today the food excellent,traditional Orange that is(all burst into laughter) they were laughing even more so shook hands(all burst into laughter) i said may be soulmates don't like me(all burst into laughter) said well the attitude is rather strange cause in a part they are happy on the other hand says is it necessary to actualize the philosophy(all burst into laughter) i said well i agree with her upto the fact that is it necessary to do too much(all laugh) said no that we recognize as well but as your Gengar says Gengar!Ah!so maddening the tune(all burst into laughter) so i said well just have a control that at the end we being human have to do more to be them(all laugh) they smiled and said yeah we understand just today this talk got us the relief(all laugh) i said yeah,most humbled to come into any service(all laugh) so they continued you see Irene we told a bit about our meeting at Unova and she said ever like that the words and opinions gets people to laugh and realize the Gengar(all laugh) and that's how the whole bunch and the master ferries(all laugh) then that bro vs beau differentiation came up(all laugh) the whole world realized the Gengar is truely so(all laugh) then Irene said you know his methods were the soulmates are so if and only if are so their vomits(all burst into laughter) psychophisyomotional(all burst into laughter) and this also as according to our contacts and our soulmate's career and all we came to know a Mr Drew Blackmore is the first hand and the very best witness to these methods(all laugh)we realized how much help that did to him and to Mrs May Maple Blackmore whoose name with your career and your with that of her is intricately joined and the reason is that as she says you're her own big bro and very fond of you and no barring the methods surely looking at their careers we realized why those methods are definitely effective yet so funny just like Gengar(all laugh) so you see this Gengarhood is so enjoying(all laugh) then we also realized how much these helped Irene as well and how much it tormented her husband being schoolmates to Gengars to being with(all laugh) and then his little sister too had be under the clutches of the Gyarados for 6 years(all laugh) and we laughed even harder thinking of the possibilitis if materialized in reality which is so obvious that one forgets to SPEW(all burst into laughter),when you're about to confess EXACTLY THEN BECOMES MAD AND BITES YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN(all burst into laughter,tears)...man spew is something(all laugh) then beautiful men continued,but then again we understood our soulmates and then realized no wonder Gengar said why bother if the full ticking is to be found which is most maddening(all laugh) i said,yeah the sharing like boiling takes time(all burst into laughter) they said yeah emotional may be are we again(all burst into laughter) i said well with real and true happiness the little fetters like emotions lose it's confining stench(all burst into laughter) hence Gengars don't think(all burst into laughter) they said yeah pretty much(all laugh) then they said well,can we ask something about the Gyarados(all laugh) i said why am i so interested about my former girlfriend(all laugh) they said no the dates(all laugh) i said well you see the path is longer so indefinite in scales(all laugh) they said no the trouble for us is the word former(all burst into laughter) i said yeah well,whole world and my close circle too which encompasses a lots of people as you understand the philsophy(all laugh) they all think it's just that i'm back to marry her only finally(all laugh) what ensures the image is wrong after all many evidences are there where like you people the illusion broke after even may be 42 years(all laugh) they said well they weren't Gengar to being with(all laugh) and neither were the soulmates absolutley Gyaradosy(all laugh) i said well,Gengars are just an universal generalization so there surely are many out of our profession(all laugh) but yeah being a Gyarados out of here is dangerous(all laugh) but still the intriguing part is why the Gyarados was the big sis generosity embodied who did so much for the city and pushed many projects many jobs were cleared for many people who wouldn't have got it despite their more than enough qualities and so on had she not intervened and all that contrasting the Gyarados that she is what is the reality was the question and it was found the the reality was the Gyarados so how was the behaviour in the last 4 years(all laugh) they said no the outside was more or less same but rather coiled herself into her and did many things still but much to a lesser degree and most of the things were settled already the vitality that really made the phenomena was never there after you left so yeah it turned out to be totally all about you but we have both directional ideas(all laugh) i said well the supposed bride that was announced after that press is none other than this Gyarados i guess is the idea(all laugh) they said yeah pretty much all know about pictures(all laugh) so yeah relizable(all laugh) i said why this idea that once in a relationship can't stay as single afterwards(all laugh) they said,well just too much knowledge of the duality assures that the first hand mental experiences and methods were most engaging(all laugh) i said well,may be but as i said the paths are hence as strange(all laugh) they said yeah but may be we atleast do hope that the announcement is sooner(all laugh) cause may be the Gyarados will go on public and create a sentimental mess confessing to you again(all laugh) i said,well i'll see what can be done with the Gyarados(all laugh) but can you enlighten us about a certain person who used to be Frucient gym leader(all laugh) they said,yeah battled him once was with Cobalion(all laugh) during our Kanto endeavour defeated him and the lad was frivolant(all laugh) went to Cerulian too actually(all laugh) but was unofficial match and was Jynx vs the same(all laugh) just got us in the end by the smallest margin possible but later after professional talks said Jynx was the one he said are too exuberent with modality(all burst into laughter) hence the psychic can be manipulated to ghostly parts as well but are no good with darks his words still anyway(all laugh) so we realized it was living in you anyway still(all laugh) i said yeah was too fond of me(all laugh) then they said that exactly was where the Frucient leader hit her(all laugh) i said,well i guess the idea of ilusion that is(all laugh) said yeah but was after the gym infact you know her name and all that given her personal troubles all combined she was nowhere but they didn't realize that it was just Reshiram(all laugh) so they continued(all laugh) said,hence wanted to control that gym so that a few nominations and all that you know to get the tags that is and so on many stuffs and your name actually roused her up else was thinking only legal procedures and then just showed why she is who she is in our profession(all laugh) i said yeah indeed once only talent and personality too you saw that bit was infatuation too deep(all laugh) they said well till we were there never seemed to recognize that cause that's reality we guess but may be we're wrong(all laugh) or just as you said the path too long(all laugh) i said well,can we discuss about that after the match where you were present(all laugh) said yeah that day was too serious and the line up was something you see the previous leader at Frucient Mr Giles was a huge name great gym leader and this one is his nephew was good but personally you see(all laugh) and yeah used a Shyamin last(all laugh) the line-up was Cacturne,Dhelmise,and Shyamin(all laugh) and she went with Gyarados of course(all laugh) if was now whole world would've been lulled out(all laugh) it was Tapu Fini,Gyarados,Primarina(all laugh) actually for it was a nasty thing you see illegal stuff hence Doctor Slate's title helps here if not nullified by his surname(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) i said,well i get so much excitement hearing this story(all laugh) men too happily said yeah we can date here whole night till tomorrow this time(all laugh) i said yeah much oblidged fill up roles theoritically same stuff(all laugh) then they said,well first we'll ask of your opinions again on of all things gym system and monitoring(all laugh and cheers for PLAYBOY at 1251st,all burst into laughter,Ash laughs a lot) so Mist's Playboy at 1253rd said(all laugh),yeah,i realize the systems you see a badge is given out so if you beat 7 time champs after 9 months in a gym with Carracosta vs Kyurem(all laugh) surely you deserve recognition(all laugh) and then still the badge has to be dished out to the challenger for fulfilling certain criterias that too has be decided by the gym leader according to manuals hence Braum is the best gym leader who hasn't got a gym(all laugh) and the challenger who being 7 time champs will have to tell the authority what he or she did in the match cause the badge should be given the other way around you see(all laugh) surely a 22 year old can't judge a 34 no matter what(all laugh) then these things will be recorded and monitored and so on i don't like this idea of pests jumping up and down for a badge impolitely and the leader being too reponsible for them that's all(all laugh) they said,yeah we guess Cerulian will be renovated much in coming days despite the common thoughts given the donations Orange has received already and we ourselves passed a few cheques and else(all laugh) i said,yeah we'll see what happens(all laugh) but what did Doctor Slate do then(all laugh) they said,well the trouble started after that brat went overboard not realizing chosen Giratinas were entering universities then(all laugh) yeah two years got suspended for shoplifting at professor's other half's in-law home(all burst into laughter,tears) then Mr Oak Mr Oak finally unwigged the wig(all laugh) then they got married and then actually Gary was the one who kept that brat down for long cause despite his insinuations he never bothered and his services there were fine but then the brats crossed limits so he got rid of the gym as he relaized the time is of that type(all laugh) then at this the brat first complained and all created a legal mess against the gym cause couldn't accuse the lab now as Ms Lillie became Mrs Oak hence the services if were a bit more at Cerulian none could argue against(all laugh) and was only that bit more nothing else which though given who they are meant the nominations were easier to get(all laugh) but the bigger problem was you lab has been accused of many things but never directly cause all know what type of brats live there(all laugh) they can win any court cases by themselves as they literally did later(all laugh) then the troubles started the gentleman tried to Muk it out didn't succeed(all laugh) then Doctor Slate was also famillially exposed then(all laugh,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs,Brock shakes his head laughing) and with her two younger sisters being truly settled now,Daisy was two positive one negetive down hence with the positive mood was about to go into the singualr territory thinking 21 years of long career all things done lets spend my days happily here with pokemons and still won't say anyway(all laugh) no really i feel bad that i wasted Daisy's 2 years for no reasons(all laugh) jackal would've been kicked into the reservation 2 years earlier(all laugh) actually should've sent Hector a letter too(all laugh)
then this trouble started and Daisy was very upset with things and then actually the lad made the mistake of directly dragging your name to which had she not been your girlfriend but like sister or family memebr would've listened to Brawn and got Crawdauntogator involved(all laugh),Brawn said that infact whole world who knew her personally,knew who her beau is(all laugh) can we say the tense rightly(all laugh),i said yeah,will be reviewed but why don't we finish with the match(all laugh) men were laughing cause by then whole world who knew me knew what my intentions were with whoose ring finger size(all laugh) asked Zara the day before the marriage day itself what your beau gave you(all burst into laughter) she was laughing saying only a Gengar asks for the model from his sis-in-law(all laugh) i said yeah,yeah,too long now so too much bonhomie with that overzealous pest so forgot the model as well being replaced(all laugh) then she was laughing handed it over to Dave who again ate me(all laugh) then finally the name was there well they also had to search(all laugh) too interested(all laugh) but thankfully it was bro and not the sis of all Torchics(all laugh) would've lectured me for whole day to SPEW(all laugh),Drew still says man missed you during the marriage you know so many hours to search for the right cost(all laugh) anyway,then men said,yeah Brawn wasn't happy that a illegal battle would happen so didn't do much cause he doesn't like sad sperations rather funny one which means what only he knows along with your Bulbasaur(all laugh) i said well he himself is 107 so his bunch plays the serious role(all laugh) so then men said,hence we never went there officially either(all laugh) i said,did you go to Pewter(all laugh) said yeah never heard of a gym leader midmatch asking um Solrock's left-upper edge is a bit weak today did you notice(all burst into laughter) we realized why Doctor Slate has become a doctor(all laugh),then anyway,the plans were there and all then she went there and the prize was as usual you know control of gym and dates and so on with mad professors at Ryrokobstic Forest at Noivern's most dreaded population(all laugh) actually Noivern is no easy a brat to tame either(all laugh) whole Kalos knows these pests at night(all laugh) that tickles(all laugh) tickle masters are something(all laugh) and they were behind me there whole time(all laugh) anyway,then first Cacturne vs Tapu Fini was a draw infact was a great match and then Dhelmise vs Gyarados which Gyarados won but then came Shyamin and smoked Gyarados off in like 10 seconds(all laugh) then was Primarina thus we get a bit interested(all laugh),i said yeah,Primarina life is about concentration of conjugative conformations(all burst into laughter) that is they will say unless you let us take you as a Primarina-to-be apprentice we will kill you instantly(all laugh) thus they will concentrate your makrs of all papers that you give as an exam to give you a grade so that you are either accepted or rejected as a Primarina(all laugh) which includes questions like the uniformity of appearing danger to satiability(all burst into laughter) which means what danger to a Primarina is enough enjoyable(all brust into laughter) which is the question the lack of 4th stage at this chain eat,digest,the undigestable automatically is rejected no more stages why(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) this answer is actually they are expecting thus to engage with them in a meaningful and fruitful conversation on life(all burst into laughter) one must give this answer as the stages that you seek are there in the food itself why is one thing edible another not if you know both are in general food(all burst into laughter) then their chain gets to the physical part thus they make themselves Primarina which they will fail to do(all burst into laughter) cause the premise is that to get out of this body now at this juncture they will ask you what is the reason behind the faculty of emotion(all burst into laughter) then you will answer them with this question tell me the difference between emotion and motion(all burst into laughter) then they will be thinking hard about the E that is meaningless alone(all burst into laughter) hence this conjuction chain says all expressions of ideas are meaningless(all burst into laughter) hence they get to the pure idea then they will ask you what is intellect(all burst into laughter) now you will again answer them by questioning them to show you the chain between hallucination and relaity(all burst into laughter) now this is a generalized point to any psychic or ghost like Trevenant,Metagross and so on that i have surely you know(all laugh) this though is to be used only when they are in certain states to be asked this question cause they otherwise will return to this psychophysical state hence you see this whole process needs you to be with them in every step in psychic channels(all laugh) and think like them as well as you at the same time cause that's what you want as they do(all laugh) as you want them to get tamed and they the opposite(all laugh) thus there are specific medicines(all laugh) anyway,at being questioned thus they will get this in conjuction and realize that both are produced from a relative point of view hence is intelligence but then you further question them another general that why being is necessary(all burst into laughter) this gets them the idea that they are holding onto themselves only projecting their being but then self deluding that they are the the reson of projection as well hence the being has never enough satiability to them thus this being isn't necessary at all which now will get them to full potential and they will tell you yeah we get it why you've made a mistake by thinking that you can be sad(all brust into laughter) thus concentration of conjugative conjunctions conforms fully to this understanding that tell them to remove the despondency of duality(all laugh) thus they are tamed(all laugh) then men were in dreams by then(all laugh),said yeah we realize what happens to the master then(all laugh) and the lab staffs as well along with their families and especially childern if young that is(all laugh) then they said but you don't have one so actually you can do it with any pokemons can't you(all laugh),i said not at all these are rather models unlike Salamence whom i did query along with Rayquaza,who was a better college-nerd(all laugh),Salamence said i need to kill my friends so stayed back(all laugh),plus i also only have learnt these after many backlogs which i still get like you know once i was at a forest in Kalos actually when you know my bunch wasn't normal(all laugh) even then you see this happened that a Raticate came along i asked him do you understand the idea of boredom(all burst into laughter) he said pity lad i feel pity at your lack of education(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) this idea you have that you want to go to the point where this boredom is representative of your urge to get something actually so that infact it regenerates your will to go harder at it by may be trying another thing sometimes and then suddenly get an intuition and go again thus you take boredom as an indication to your interest is only because you're still at a level of Ratata high school last year last exam supplimentary fail(all burst into laughter) this idea of Raticate is that you get this boredom to not indicate your interest but to reflect upon your interest(all burst into laughter) thus rather than being interested we should be bored all the time shouldn't we(all burst into laughter) hence only the right things will be caught then you will give your full effort there and then eventually you still will run out of interest cause that job will either end or won't but you must know so many things that will generate different problems hence this effort to know or do anything of interest is useless cause the interest itself is the reason why the problems are more and more generated after which you run at forgetting the interest that you had to begin with thus you must ask why is there a thing called interest the answer is cause there's boredom(all burst into laughter) hence if you're ever bored then eventually all will interest you while you're bored thus you see total discrepancy hence you realize all the trouble is this idea of being that wants more food cause you're not happy with your idea of yourself though each moment you know what you are is just that so this validation attempts go on in total futility thus anyway everything is so boring except the unfoldment from in and to insanity of course(all burst into laughter) so why would you be interested to know the ideas of boredom rather than the ideas of generation of spontaneous urge to be a being despite already being one to begin with from an Emirats professor(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) hence lad,don't sit in the last bench beyond middle school giving excuses that your bike punctured on-the-fly(all burst into laughter) so(laugh,all laugh) you see it's trial and error to learn these things ever no matter my condition or that of my bunch(all laugh) then men said yeah we realize why Raticates are damn brats(all laugh) and don't get bored cause they already are hence they search for insanity thus grab our collers to tell us that to them threatening us with massacre(all laugh) i said yeah,normallly that's the first year engineering project i couldn't qualify the entrance(all brust into laughter) then they said yeah we understand why she wanted to predict all the time(all laugh),then(laugh,all laugh)they said well did you tell this chain conjunctive concentration of logic of Primarina to her before(all laugh) i said no just Trevenant's views i told a Trevenant is only so cause of his own idea of the same hence useless cause i think i'm Ash Ketchum actually we all know it's a confinement isn't it(all burst into laughter) then they said,yeah for Gengars(all laugh) then they said well her Primarina was too good and got Shyamin his best brat(all laugh) was a hard fought match though but she got it in the end was just as usual seemed too comfortable though her Primarina was in trouble then afterwards she still won with amusingly intuitive moves and then told us that it's always about mixing the previous challenger's idea of the her to that of her next brats idea of the previous challenger that he didn't see(all burst into laughter) but she did so(laugh,all laugh) that is the continuous chain which gets to to predict things better(all laugh) like when two words may come(all laugh) then they said we realized this predictive chain itself is such great then just complimented her on the win and yeah,Mr Oak was there alongside me who hearing this just said that according to Mr Oak(all laugh) it's what is called the flagging off of ethical revolution of insanity(all burst into laughter) then we realized that this is so great a way of thinking so later we asked of her opinions on your Kalos final(all laugh) knew that she won't be nice at all(all laugh) but we were curious as to most of your bunch was known to her so what was her opinion on your style then(all laugh) cause we said that we have much respect for your style but this is totally unpredictable(all laugh) wasn't nice to us as usual(all laugh) but not impolite(all laugh) didn't give the answer just said don't know,just a freak(all laugh) and then sighed and said if he wasn't would've been anyway(all laugh) then we realized the lack of answer was cause that was the answer that hence only my style is anyway(all laugh) and this was just after the gentleman held his ceremony where we were invited(all laugh) met your mom actually(all laugh) was there just for just a little time but we went with Doctor Slate and Mrs Slate(all laugh) Mrs Slate's views were strange like why would we not come alone(all burst into laughter,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs) and she sang a nice song later on the cake cutting moment,Foster why didn't you complimet her,um sorry Florie dear but you know as it's just her PROFESSION(all burst into laughter,Violet brusts into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) hence was a nice gentle jackling ceremony without Marill(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing,Daisy bursts into laughter) and no other choised pokebrats were there visible that is(all laugh) thus all left unscathed including the gentleman(all laugh) but not Mr Oak(all laugh) as Mr Oak was only present at the cutting moment and all and Mrs Oak looked so dissapointed for this as it was as usual AGIAN(all laugh),during his own ceremony first Mr Oak Mr Oak found all his dresses were Muked(all laugh) somehow his grandpa controlled his wife(all laugh) this was cause the expense was unnecessary which Mr Oak forgot as he forgot to mention Mr Oak marries Lillie wig(all laugh) thus come at this time sorry couldn't specify it as said Mr Oak(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) then Mr Oak still even on that day tried to go to the lab which Mrs Oak tried to foil(all laugh) but soon found a certain Emboar have sneaked into her own room(all laugh) who asked her this fire you have of emotions(all laugh) how do you know that it's ideal when you already have an idea of the ideal(all burst into laughter) somehow she managed to flee the scene of her own room(all laugh) now she enquired as to who the culprit was who zapped first Muk inside the cabinet and now this brat in(all laugh) which then wasn't found out but as Mr Oak was supposed to come to the ceremony after finally getting ready after a field day with Whimsicott as usual(all laugh) where Mrs Oak herself pushed him to cause Emboar solemnly sat on a chair and said this chair isn't ideal(all laugh) thus the broken chair was turned to sadly ashes(all laugh) so Mrs Oak tried to immitate her elder sis(all laugh) so somehow the brat was kicked out(all laugh) then Mr  Oak returned and the he was just about to go to the ceremony,when he found out his jacket hosts Spiritnown(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) surely he was dispirited(all laugh) thus he opened the cabinet which hosted Celebislash(all burst into laughter) yeah perfect combinations for the ceremony as well(all laugh),hence he could barely wear anything(all laugh) and these were the zapping culprits of course(all laugh) this was due to gentleman's too much glee that he neglected his special duty(all laugh) cause he dared to scoff at pests like Glalie(all laugh) cause he wanted to be serious thus all revolted along with a damn brat Shiftree(all laugh) the soultion was found out in gradfatherly words understand this grand personal connection(all burst into laughter) this insinuated to a Playboy Kethcum again of course(all laugh) thus Mrs Oak cried(all laugh) hence the ceremony was real(all laugh) thus people were happy cause a Yveltal was somehow kept away from there(all laugh) thus next day Mrs Oak went out too unhappy got Snorlaxed(all laugh) who said attacking the attack is just the idea hence crying is no solution to sorrow(all laugh) then he was fondled to death thus is it said in the gospel that,AH!BOULDER!BOULDER!(all laugh)..then talking about the Boulder,then at gentleman's ceremony this was to be taken care of but by then the lab had a new pest named Heatran(all laugh) and a Greninja was there for briefly but this Heatran didn't like the fact that she despite being an absolute damn brat was rather more calm(all laugh) so now went to her fullest thus whole group was agitated so as to why the gentleman was happy cause he is attacking them with his happiness(all burst into laughter)cause his happiness is an attack as that being natural to him now why is that too much in him overflowing(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing),this we learnt from Doctor Slate how was our guide in the ceremony as he took us with him there as i told you(all laugh) then this was the reason why Mr Oak had to be held up there till almost 20(all laugh) then as usual came just in time and was all drenched in sweat just the bottles of deos helped(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) then he again left at 20:30 cause news reached his room is hosting a Dialga(all laugh) who was zapped in by Giratina of course(all laugh) and Latios this time(all laugh) so a Dialga in a bedroom at 20:30 at night(all laugh) is a bit discomforting to Mr Oak cause which type allowed him to realized even while zapped how will he have to stand so that all inside the room is intact(all laugh) the hallucinations of trials that is(all laugh) then as soon as Mr Oak entered he said what means this moment to your sanity(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing),then anyway,we met your mom there and had a few plesantries exchanged and that's all but the reason Doctor Slate said is to show the downfall of Playboy Ketchum(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) but that was strange cause Mrs Ketchum had a Mr Mime all along(all laugh) seemed very calm but actually is the most wicked brat(all laugh) anyway,then Doctor Slate said this is why i introduced you see what is real pokemon mastery in contrast(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing),we realized just so naive(all laugh) then the ceremony went and yeah we also have been to Doctor Slate's marriage ceremony at Boulder of course(all laugh) it was rather emotional(all laugh) yeah,genteleman was the best man for both Mr Oak and Doctor Slate but Mr Oak couldn't be the best man cause he is on-the-fly generally as he at that moment remembers he has to anwer why a man is best only then(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) thus Doctor Slate himself did the honours there but another is pending(all laugh) here only one can be the best man Cili(all laugh)..Cili(all laugh)..Ash don't go to Huntelion tomorrow(all laugh) anyway then they said thus our confusion a bit actually that why you will not get the 4th ceremony done the next February itself at latest to mark your 20 years anniversary together(all laugh) i said,well the reason is that the length of the path that is(all laugh) they said so then(all laugh) i said only that she was my girlfriend once after all that is(all laugh) they were too happy(all laugh) cause this is Gengar stuff,only one for life(all laugh) all such for all such that is(all laugh,Ash and Misty smile at each other) so i said this exactly(all laugh) they were laughing saying may be(all laugh) and then i said well,whole world will have to wait to see the full show that is(all laugh) and the reslut only in the end(all laugh) but back to my Sinnoh break and your illusion what was after i left for Unova the playboy parts that is,they said,well only Gyaradoses would've got into the trouble none else cause they would've scheduled a show there using not you but Tyranitar(all burst into laughter) surely whole world general government knows that brat to stay safe and sane(all laugh),then they said,anyway,then finally the playboy was playing(all laugh)...i said all beause of lack of dark pigments(all burst into laughter)..this time men were happy(all burst into laughter) said this should be reminded in schools and other gatherings and competitions(all burst into laughter) then i say more so cause natural gentleness is wrongly interpreted(all laugh)..said yeah absolutely agree but that too should be added(all laugh) and also there was the 9-1 McShin trophy(all laugh) then i say but all the 4 stars were made subject to rude behaviour said,yeah the same reason but Gyarados’ are a spesis that people are interest in cause in wild it’s very hard to catch then to gym battle that is very hard indeed i said but in Unova they have Palkia,Kyurem,toss(all laugh),said that’s why Unova Elite4 is poorest(all burst into laughter) then they say yeah afterwards we now realize inside mind all Ash Ketchum but outside had to show Ash Ketchum the jealousy tricks(all laugh) i said,i understand what are the methods(all laugh) said,no nothing a few words to show how comparing in the scale of Mr Ash Ketchum one may be granted which words(all laugh) i said,then the Cerulian reaction to the playboy(all laugh),said,no majority loathed but then all knew that better not invite lunatics(all laugh) and that was cause of those recordings of abstruse philosophical ideas propagated by the likes of Heliolisk(all burst into laughter) who later said this idea of a certain encompasses all cause else how do you encertain that like yourself(all burst into laughter) so these ever helped people so they rather kept a distance that is(all laugh),i said,yeah i'm so lucky to have that bunch that i have being bestowed upon me(all laugh) but what of the Tyranitar reports,said,that was the beginning(all laugh) there were so many Solgaleo,Yveltal,Metagross,Luxray,Snorlax,Crawdauntogator(all laugh),Spiritomb,Emboar,Infernape,Bisharp,Donphan,Marshadow and so on(al laugh) and this still doesn’t include the thunder-chair merchant starter(all laugh)i said,really fear should drive people away(all laugh) said,no the image in public meant that just playboy who is too heavenly(all laugh) i said only cause they didn’t face one among his bunch(all laugh) said,yeah but a Butterfree took down a Garchomp in Hoenn Elite4(all laugh),i said,no the challenger went back to the master(all laugh) said,yeah that none ever realized(all laugh) i said still why the 2.5 years of madness with shows and gyms(all laugh) said,well all has career goals but very hard to manage,i said,yeah that bit i know but why the situation decreased as the Tyranitar reports increased surely no matter whom were there as family heads,said,no just sentimental heads(all laugh) and gentlemen gentlemen(all burst into laugh,Daisy and Tracey .ly laugh) i said yeah we know family matters surely if misunderstanding is there then things happens but the decision is only in best interest no matter the result but why eavesdrop(all laugh) said yeah the championship and your pigments(all laugh) that’s why at the start everyone should be given a Gastly(all laugh) i said may be then now many of those in hall of fame would’ve been hotel managers(all laugh) said,yeah but things are cleared(all laugh) i said why bother one may be 2 impossible plus the pokemons were good enough just the idea then about a few books may be at most enough said,yeah that’s where Elite4 has to come in cause pokemons are dumb(all laugh) i said,well they only show you the way why turn on them said,no that is there but few wants too much attention and fondling(all laugh) so definitely atleast few lines in the charts(all laugh) i said yeah i agree but anyway,why were Salamances in Kalos scary(all laugh) said,no Mr Oak Mr Oak said just not that type(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)...Mr Oak Mr Oak what are doing/Oh Mr Oak please you soulmate is rueing/Mr Oak Mr Oak you liked her so much just now/but Mr Oak now you don’t tell why and how(all burst into laughter,Lillie .s and laughs)...sister mind this

Violet(laugh) : “just so naive(all burst into laughter)...”
Brock(laugh) : “this brat will get me unemployed(all laugh)..Ash i’ll mingle in foods(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “that’s why the tiffin is there(all laugh)...but Jackal(all laugh) thus your present for looking after MAR_SHAD_OW(all laugh) cause he along with Dusknoir is going to assist Doctor Slate(all laugh) and will be shifted to other places whom do you wish(all laugh)...”
Tracey(laugh) : “just give me few damn poems you brat(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “yeah sure with the preset that Banette and Marshadow will be shifted now the place will be filled up by not Bulbasaur no you’re right serious changing is needed to get those brats setteld(all laugh) Infernape will not be there either and Bulbasaur is relieved after 19 years so you will see some magic(all laugh) as in the case of Infernape the infighting that they do and so on will from now be looked after by Gengleye(all burst into laughter) whole lab is under them now(all laugh) in the gym none but Hawlucha and Talonflame as usual(all laugh),Garchomp already you know has returned and is an encyclopedia reflector now(all laugh) but Lugias need a personal assistant which will help them to settele them down by Muking(all laugh) along with the fact that where they actually are(all laugh) Banette is being freed up to roam around(all laugh) so please welcome Trace Assistant 1. let us have a vote, on 2,1.Glalie(all burst into laughter and .) and then a special one 2.Greninja(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing)

(song)
Stop and stare(all burst into laughter,Daisy in tears laughing,Tracey shakes his head laughing)
You start to wonder why you're here not there(all burst into laughter and and .)
And you'd give anything to get what's fair(all burst into laughter,Daisy fits and convulsions from laughter,Tracey uncontrollbaly laughs)
But fair ain't what you really need(all uncontrallbly laugh,Tracey and Daisy in fits of laughter)
Oh, can you see what I see'(all burst into laughter and . and cheer for Tracey and Daisy)

but wait that’s one Luverin(all laugh) now Caserin(all .)

(song)

And even though the feeling's been gone, I just wanna be here(all burst into laughter,Tracey laughs .ly)
Would you pick up the little pieces of remains
I'm going down, the plane is smoking
And the only one who can save me is you, but you want to
Throw me away(all burst into laughter and .,Tracey and Daisy laugh uncontrollably)
Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I wanna know
I gotta know why you wanna throw me away(all laugh)
You used to ask why was I so skeptic of heart(all burst into laughter,Tracey .ly laughs)
see, 'cause it changes(all laugh uncontrollably)
And it ain't got to be no real reason
You start to live the dream and before you know
There's a door that opens, and the moment you walk in, it’s close
Ooh, soul, oh, soul, oh, my soulmate(all burst into laughter)
Just ain't what it used to be
I confronted my fears with open arms(all burst into laughter,Tracey and Daisy laugh uncontrollably)
Although you said you will never give up on us
But now you blow me away(all burst into laughter,Tracey uncontrollably laughs)
Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I wanna know why you wanna blow me away(all laugh)
Perfect we said we'd never be
So why is this happening to me?
No way, no way (No way) (all burst into laughter)
No way, no way (No way)
Away, away, away
I wanna know why you wanna throw me away
(all laugh and . and cheer for Tracey and Daisy)

compare them with the Glaheeyem(all burst into laughter)”

Daisy(laugh) : “i should’ve battled this brat that day and beat the hell out(all laugh)”
Tracey(laugh) : “SO GLORIOUS(all laugh)..no this is another level(all laugh)..and pretty decent voice(all laugh)..Misty why is he stealing the show materials(all laugh)
Misty(smile,same pose) : “i won’t say(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “i will take Zeraora off from tomorrow though cause he needs to gain more knowledge from Lugias(all laugh) replacement is Mismagius(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)...and this tribute(all laugh)...

Hey Gary I'm talking to you(all burst into laughter and .,Gary shakes his head laughing)
Stop yourself and listen
Some things you can never choose
Even if you try yeah
You're bangin' your head again(all burst into laughter,Lillie .s laughing)
Cause somebody won't let you in(all uncontrollably laugh)
One chance, once your soul(all laugh)
Your chance to let me know(all laugh)
We can't go on
Just running away(all burst into laughter)
If we stay any longer
We will surely never get away(all burst into laughter,.,Lillie uncontroolably laughs)
Anything you want, we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around
Never let the heart shoot us down(all laugh)
Never, never
Never, never run away
Hey Gary you know it's true
Why you bother lying when you know(all burst into laughter)
That you want it too
Don't you dare deny me
Walk those legs right over here
Give me what I'm dying for
One chance, one hug
Hug me and never let me go(all burst into laughter)
We can't go on
Just running away
If we wait any longer
We will surely never get away

(all . and cheer for Lillie and Gary)
Mr Oak Mr Oak why are you not me(all laugh)...”

Lillie(laugh) : “there’s no hope of comeback even in dreams(all laugh)..and Mist flower what a voice(all laugh)...”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “and you heard only one i hear so many..my(all laugh) sweet hubby(all laugh)”
Gary(laugh) : “but i’m resigning tomorrow(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “wigged is the insinuation Mr Oak why is called self-reflective-so-subjective-divorce(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollably laughs hugging Gary,Gary shakes his head laughing) but for Violet any song isn’t needed to be spoken of(all laugh) cause this last one is her composition(all laugh) for the naivety to move this way(all burst into laughter,Violet uncontrollably laughs,Brock shakes his head laughing) changed to suit(all laugh) plagarism(all laugh) but then again the new permanent assistant and also for future of Doctor Brock Slate is Duskshadow(all laugh)...so an insignificant trial to see if this serves any purpose...DUSKSHADOW(all laugh)...

Some words are better off forgotten(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing)
We bury them in places that we really only visit by ourselves
Oh you were so caring like no other(all burst into laughter,Violet uncontrollably laughs)
Oh they only tell you what to do before all you see is gone(all uncontrollably laugh,Brock laughs .ly)
What's the sense in anything when you think what they say is wrong?(all uncontrollably laugh,fits of laughter)

Oh what do you want to hear?
Do you want to know how many times
I tore myself apart cause you're not here?(all burst into laughter,Brock puts his hands on his forhead laughing,Violet uncontrollably laughs tears fits of laughter)
Oh why do you want to know?
Does it make you feel alive(all burst into laughter)
I had to die to finally let you go(all uncontrollably laugh,Brock same pose laughs shaking his head)

Stop me... I find myself believing
A story gets rewritten so a blasphemy's permitted once again(all uncontrollably laugh)
Oh and you were so perfectly imperfect(all uncontrollaby laugh,fits of laughter,tears)
Oh why would they tell you what to do when all you have are lies(all uncontrollably laugh,fits of laughter,tears,Brock hides his face with his hands laughing,Violet uncontrollably laughs with tears and fits of laughter)
What's the sense in anything? It's just one more goodbye(all uncontrollably laugh,with tears,Brock same pose shaking his head)
If you so much want it then just go away
(all burst into laughter,.,cheers for Brock and Violet and Boulder)

perfect time for perfectly balanced ACTION(all burst into laughter)..DUSKSHADOW(all laugh)...”

Violet(laugh) : “man..this is really some other plane(all laugh) and yeah this is going to the Boulder(all laugh)..and what a voice(all laugh)...did you reharse these(all laugh)”
Ash(laugh) : “well i knew i’ll say these in official reports(all uncontrollably laugh,tears)...the words and lines are just so perfect(all laugh) and cause it just makes one so naive(all burst into laughter)...”
Brock(laugh) : “Mr Oak Mr Oak can atleast get another job but this brat has made me unemployable(all burst into laughter) Misty don’t like him so much(all burst into laughter)..”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “shut up you crook(all laugh) my Ash is my projection(all burst into laughter)..i(all laugh) will do whatever i want with my sweet bee(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “so you see this level is needed to get those brats mixed here(all laugh) whoose the beaus(all laugh)..anyway(all burst into laughter),so back to Salamences,so i said look dragons aren’t that bad see the Altaria(all laugh) and Flygon(all burst into laughter) still a Kyogre,a Regirock and then a Cobalion and of all a Gyarados(all laugh) and so on enough to begin and Greninja is good enough as well said,no juts that type(all laugh) then i said well must be hard after Hoenn title said,yeah pretty hard and that was the trouble(all laugh) i said well i was still in too much great terms there(all laugh) said,no you see don’t mind but just if there was even a false ring(all laugh) i said,well you see that might’ve saved me as well as you surely know what happened to me but does it stop the eventual said,no that we agree thus was the trouble as well(all laugh) i said among mutuality i guess(all laugh) said yeah,back to school(all laugh) i said well i never knew that so many may challenge me for getting foisted upon people with whom i only beheaved as a friend cause they were good and travel company you understand no big deal unless imay be in some cases a hall of famer cause you have no life then(all laugh) said,yeah that’s the thing but school only for familiarity(all laugh) that was about a week(all laugh) but the whole phenomena with all was hard(all laugh) i said,yeah i get that but i don’t believe Hoenn was due to influences nor was Orange the last may be said,yeah Orange certainly not cause the minds were too scared of Salamences popping up(all laugh) but still got Altaria(all laugh) far well behaved(all laugh) i said,well might’ve been just Altaria vs Naganadel(all burst into laughter) say the same(all laugh) surely my activities were known with Crawdauntogator(all laugh) why choose water,said no we realize that then the HQ roofs were enough(all burst into laughter) i said,exactly my travel would’ve been saved as well cause none would’ve wanted the final(all laugh) said,yeah but even in an office can do(all laugh) ghosts are hard though we only felt water was nice tempred(all laugh) with even fire a few but ghosts and dragons(all laugh) i said well hard indeed but Kanto isn’t easy by any means yeah true that my starter region but still Melody Sanders won(all burst into laughter) said,yeah we get that(all laugh) that’s why also Kalos is to be avoided(all laugh) i said may be true certainly would’ve liked to meet at Hoenn again(all laugh) said,yeah that was strange you were favourite at Johto i said,gentleman i guess(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) said,yeah only a bit this from the time of correspondence(all laugh)9 out of 10 reserved for you in illusion never once any praise for any women competitor even then(all burst into laughter) i said no before Kanto you see that’s more interesting cause strange is the press that a trio like Tyranitar,Solgaleo and Yveltal gets playboy tag(all burst into laughter) but still i see the men why ever a confusion to that extent as well schools surely not(all laugh) said,no never cleared Cerulian itself became a world we saw after Hoenn surely we guess this does of hunting heads(all laugh) was necessary i said,yeah well i have time for long chats restart the Hoenn beginning(all laugh) no your name was buzzing(all laugh) but then this idea was there of a phonix(all laugh) but no after a few months at Hoenn hard place and nothing mattered then even after Hoenn not that much but the school(all laugh) i said yeah i saw a few at school(all laugh) and other places too like Melody Sanders to begin with(all burst into laughter)...still(all burst into laughter) not happy(all laugh) wonder what if i did the right thing by saying ok tag along and Mist flower in Viridian with Melody and gets that news(all laugh) later girlfriend-flower was playing big sister with whole world(all laugh) thus was more compassionate to her than me(all laugh) but now at this moment that mask is no more so again jealousy comes though we’re married for 2 years(all laugh)...21(all laugh) right,but infact in that case Mist flower would’ve held traditions out of blue(all laugh) so the two words wouldn’t have been needed(all laugh) i just imagine my conditions then and after if crook was there(all laugh) that FEELING(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter,Violet in tears laughing,Brock laughs shaking his head) is famillialy just so naive(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs in convulsions of laughter hugging Brock who laughs shaking his head) Melody spoke for 2 hours(all laugh) whole life including personal was known(all laugh) and a few discussions and then asked me about the obvious(all laugh) i told her who Mist and Brock is Pewter wasn’t visited Cerulian was(all laugh) Daisy was in contact for long was her gym where she first realized her abilities like me in Viridian and that had to be Brawn(all laugh) and that’s why Brawn doesn’t want tags(all laugh) creatures(all laugh) Dewgong got Reuniclased(all laugh) then knew the show a bit Safforn being twin cities would’ve(all laugh) and then i say Mist is sister 4th and hence youngest(all laugh) asks yeah i see but she dancing..(all laugh) that dance Melody ever remembered as you know and before semis we never spoke(all laugh) and that dance was 5 to 7 minutes i don’t think even was 10 cause i would’ve been charged for not discloing my wife’s identity(all laugh) and that too not newly married but for 5 years(all laugh)..right(all laugh),so anyway,i said no Mist is my best friend(all laugh) and is like that very simple and sweet we are very best friends very good friends(all laugh) that meant i’m booked(all laugh) and after Johto i was aghast that she could go away from me away,away,away(all laugh)..anyway(all burst into laughter),so then i couldn’t say much cause i thought what if i say i cherish you so much Mist but why are you going away from me(all laugh) then she would’ve created a mayhem(all laugh) so i thought it’s ok on the way i’ll visit Cerulian but then for 1 month stayed at home each day spoke with her in video(all laugh) for 1 hour(all laugh) at noon at night 2(all laugh) jackal was there one week here one(all laugh) the week jackal was absent was hard(all laugh) if jackal was there she could go out else not(all laugh) thus jackal was here for first 2.5 months then wasn’t for next 2.5 then again next 2 and then again went out for next 3 but by then she was big sister and her big sisters returned(all laugh) but the day my Mist flower said life is such i still recall(all laugh) i was incensed(all laugh) i thought i’ll see how’s your sweet sweet life when i call you Misty(all laugh)...right(all laugh),next day called her by full name(all laugh)..right(all laugh), and she was so dejected(all laugh) and i also was sure no damn brat was allowed to call her by that nickname means she’s my best friend(all laugh) then i was waiting for 2 words(all laugh) she was here for 1st month was hard 2nd same and from the end of 2nd itself brats were jumping and then Trace was there atleast but then in the middle of 3rd  he had to leave and upto 5th brats were around 4th  got Gyarados by 6th all were cleard and Trace again was there to help the final cleaning(all laugh) then 8th sisters returned and the brats and else got Daisy’s Dewgong(all laugh) then by 11th when she met me her develoment was almost full(all laugh) then just a matter of experience and Mist was good enough to be a hall of famer at 27 itself anywhere barring Unova and that was cause she was not from Unova(all laugh) well in reality Mist really is the universal water empress as you know(all laugh) once only but it’s just that no Gengar(all burst into laughter) that FEELING(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) cause Mist is too infatuated with me(all laugh) hence no Gengar cause Gengars don’t know what is a feeling that doesn’t tickle(all burst into laughter) well mine doesn’t for sure(all laugh) no really in normal circumstances my Palkia would’ve been here and the rest is that Mist would’ve beaten anyone in the world but had to tame Palkia by Palkian life(all laugh) to make sure it becomes a circus thus she never had to work again(all laugh) each in Unova gave up there breeding power in the madness but i chided them on this and each said this is before and they said a few choised brats disturbing our minds in the gap in between our thought process(all burst into laughter)..and you realize this is straight from single philosophical perfect life if not monastic(all laugh) anyway then i said yeah i saw beauty as well but never became not gender cause the span was minimal as normal to normal max never crossed that and i was 31+ to begin with(all laugh) then they said,yeah but doesn’t it ever prolong no matter the current(all burst into laughter) i said well you see even that can happen only once like we agreed(all laugh) so yeah may be not if monitored and definitely if the want is still there but again i guess you know the time(all laugh) said,yeah that’s true but still 5 years(all laugh) how can things be so true(all laugh) i said well there the right motivation should be there like in your case it was waking up my case was the same but i wasn’t in that unfortunate illusion so i woke up to the fact that may be why bother at all about all these and rather only be with my bunch said yeah that is a possibility with your bunch being so unique it’s enough engaging for one life(all laugh) then i said,but then again,we must go back to build it(all burst into laughter) said,yeah that’s what the women don’t want(all burst into laughter) too nice but starnge is the trust still(all laugh) surely not here but for attentions that should be only on Yveltals(all laugh) i said yeah that i agree but i saw your contacts as well(all burst into laughter) the group was schoolmates(all laugh) said,yeah the idea(all burst into laughter) but surely you know about water pokemon knowledge(all laugh) i said,yeah pretty much but surely just a faint idea cause may be how long till the Solgaleo caught less attention enough to create the trouble may be 17 years i guess(all laugh) said,yeah just that idea somehow 17 and then 4 more(all laugh) 21 years but then out of it takes just one(all burst into laughter) i said,yeah life is strange(all laugh) just the age realted issues(all laugh) said,yeah but 21 years only cause of inconsistency surely Salamences are way worse(all laugh) doesn’t break(all laugh) i said,but Latias and Latios and Palkia even sometimes they are way worse(all laugh) said,no the behaviours of the Latias better but yeah Palkia is impossible meance(all laugh) i said well i guess should’ve been in school there then(all burst into laughter) said,yeah first day same Viridian Lake(all burst into laughter) i said,well i understand but the lake why so much infatuation(all laugh) said,that was trouble to the family(all burst into laughter) but you come across as egotististical(all laugh) which is ever the trouble to family as well(all laugh) we guess it was about the words and gifts(all burst into laughter) i said yeah to look after a gym with those personal situations people become rough(all laugh) only a filter(all laugh,Daisy .ly laughs) and yeah those gifts and words are just the right materials to pass through filter showing the lebel as Daisy not Daisyl(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs) but yeah nothings perfect(all laugh) but nothing happened all cause of the gentleman i’m sure you know(all laugh) said,well you surely know your starter lab co directors(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) definitely but ceremony should’ve been together with Mr and Mrs Oak(all burst into laughter) i said,yeah 8 months after Mr Oak(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) but did you help them ever(all burst into laughter) said,yeah told the gentleman nice to know the whole family(all burst into laughter) but he sighed(all uncontrollably laugh,Tracey laughs .ly and Daisy uncontrollably laughs in fits of laughter as well) and yeah the other way as well just that look(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs and in tears laughing,Tracey uncontrollbaly laughs as well) and Mr Oak was never happy with our activities(all laugh) as Mr Oak we know and the starter lab rules(all laugh) very strange that all there and all here and then the first gym leader as well(all laugh) but has a link somehow a real novel(all burst into laughter and .) i said i guess previous lives you may believe in(all laugh) said,yeah otherwise 21 years and then just 1 can’t be really validated(all laugh) and this means not to worry at all(all laugh) but hard with life(all laugh) i said,yeah that’s what’s spoken all over the place but still there are singles and then far ahead are monks(all laugh) they are happy far more than we’ll be living life only for others and purely said,yeah somehow next phases we guess when the other is rather as if two in one so no outside(all laugh) i said,yeah i absoulutely agree and both way as nuns as well(all laugh) so similarity applies if all there but surely then isn’t it(all laugh) said,yeah we agree with the whole picture(all laugh) but this to the random challengers(all burst into laughter) and then every year 96 new champs everywhere so so few in hall of fame and even multiple champions and dragons are there too we guess(all laugh) if not Salamence,Palkia for sure(all laugh) surely life is strange(all laugh) i said,yeah i concur wholeheartedly but to win leagues Palkia was  defeted innumerable times(all laugh) said,yeah defeating is one but if that meance is in the living room then different game(all laugh) i said,yeah surely but Mr Oak was intelligent by moments as Mr Oak is wasn’t he(all laugh) said,yeah the gentleman then married of course 8 months later(all laugh) when we last met said a great thing persistence per precise perceptions(all burst into laughter) same thing we guess(all laugh) i said,yeah helped you too evenly all times despite the environmental concerns then and his own ideas of the situation that’s why the perfect gentleman(all burst into laughter,Tracey .ly laughs) said,yeah surely did but our perceptions were wrong(all laugh) i said yeah but one must realize the goal said,yeah we what we did was that what we heard form Doctor Brock Slate(all laugh) and did that with the illusion both times really(all laugh) but we guess you can spend the whole day here(all burst into laughter) i said yeah pretty much looking at the whole weather too happy why so much adoration(all laugh) said,no that’s the contradictory part(all laugh) these people most here thinks of you as young Ketchum dream(all uncontrollably laugh,.) only the press meetings have made sure they understand the wrong contradiction and thus don’t disturb your peace though we know you’re not at all polite yourself(all laugh) if that is actually still disturbed(all laugh) but anyway, so that you’re a sought after name along with your bunch cause their endeavours are baffling(all laugh) so you being the master need to control them(all laugh) and thus when the right contradiction is pointed to people come up with isuues like we ourselves are doing(all burst into laughter) but that’s the point cause then we only have warmth and respect and yet the wrong contradiction makes sure that we understand that the respect is of ever similar level that somehow you’re this great man who knows many unbelieveable things and only if properly approached will say but even there in talks and all we’re sorry for the language but you surely will understand so we’re not explainging so excuse for the language again but Ash Ketchum no matter what titles deeds or allegations is in core more like a Gengar(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) which if the general dictionary is used then means frivolus(all laugh) but that’s exactly another contradiction to keep even outside profession people at total bay(all laugh) so this can’t be a plan we guss(all laugh) i said well yeah life is strange(all laugh) but can a person at 35 be called young(all burst into laughter) said,no the cosmetics feed ideas mutually(all uncontrollably laugh) i said,yeah the other way around is hard to know else own experience dictates so(all burst into laughter) said,yeah infact you loved ponytails as well as we were indicated(all burst into laughter) i said,yeah just that idea(all laugh) but why would someone go upto that point(all laugh) said,yeah you see only self harming cause the flight tickets are to us rather not costly neither the experience there(all laugh) so we were helped rather as was each there no matter how hurt and you’re here cause things really are suiting the name(all laugh) i said yeah i was contacted by Lance himself cause she is like his daughter of that age and is extremely skillfull one of a kind so i was asked if i could help i said yeah let’s see what appeases the moods(all laugh) but still we’ve been stuck at the quote(all laugh) what of the times(all laugh) said,well the previous day was a bit emotional(all laugh) cause we thought of getting into the 3 city circle administration jobs which are innumerable in numbers(all laugh) and etc but needed to understand issues you see, i said yeah the age was right(all burst into laughter) said ,yeah so thought of clearing things up and went there the family knew the issues(all laugh) at that time Mr Oak had married so was no more not liking us by abstaining as you understand(all laugh) and the head was desperate by then cause the gentleman was unnecessarily pesisting too much with the mask(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing,Daisy uncontrollably laughs) but we guess you are interested in the Kanto beginning more(all laugh) i said yeah definitely said,well that time the main leader was nowhere in her head(all laugh) so she was not behaving properly as to suddenly become too emotional(all laugh) the whole world knew a Mr Ash Ketchum was the reson(all laugh) the trouble was he was roaming around with a certain Tyranitar(all laugh) so the replacement were being searched for(all burst into laughter) for the exact contradiction that you represent(all laugh) that baffled even Brock(all laugh) so then you see a few good friends were there(all laugh) and thus the idea(all laugh) no none in the surroundings understood one bit of this contradiction(all laugh) cause all were taught professionality(all laugh) exactly what they never liked(all laugh) cause they couldn’t approach you at all(all laugh) you said like yeah this is what it is about you and her but see if a Tyranitar faces a Kyogre(all burst into laughter) which meant ego but they didn’t know that was the exact truth of reality of what none knows about a Tyranitar for their safe passage(all laugh) so anyway thus we came to know and was curious cause the whole world by then knew Tyranitar(all laugh) if not a Solgaleo who was named as Madgaleo(all laugh) cause he when was tried to be tested jumped upon the poor doctors but fondling them(all laugh) yet the machines read he was saying he wants to feed on their each beaus together(all burst into laughter) and still there was time for a Yveltal who did the similar thing but said to the people are you girlfriend’s choised beaus(all uncontrollably laugh) and Tyranitar went the furthest saying who’se who’se illegal beau(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) bring their beaus too some choised brats sneaked away behind the hallucinations yesterday(all burst into laughter) this meant the battle was mental cause the hallucinations were self created(all laugh) thus they won’t harm so no termination but only they would never have been terminated at all the whole lab would’ve(All laugh) for each thus atleast 80 labs would’ve been no more with people and pokemons inside(all laugh) then in a dragonic water gym Heracross was used(all laugh) who tossed away a Palkia out of the battlefield as soon as she could grab him(all laugh) and the leader wanted to quit the gym(all laugh) was fed with a Donphan(all burst into laughter) who directly attcaked the leader by rolling and jumping to the opposite platform to create a quake that was enough to shake the water up for the Gyarados of all pokemons to get scared beyond death(all laugh) and then when Gyarados was up a canonball stuck him(all laugh) which meant Donphan made his way back to you with Gyarados(all laugh) the leader said i’ve got grandkids(all burst into laughter) to which you cried that she was trying to take away your livelyhood(all burst into laughter) so a poor Kyurem had to be the chosen one(all laugh) who was given a Noctowl(all burst into laughter) not one ice beam worked and so on cause the owl each time the beam was there from underwater expected it’s spot and diverted(all laugh) Kyurem had to come up when the little pokemon created a gust that took the water away may be(all laugh) the so Kyurem had to charge which meant the gust threw him out of the gym(all laugh) if the owl’s body charge wasn’t enough while he was supposed to be in halluciantion(all laugh) the leader gave the badge and may be hasn’t been found again(all laugh) this was the last gym before the Unova finals the best water type in Unova and Kalos combined as the name suggested and before this such absurd choises were never made alwyas a normal choise  or water or flying or some dual ground or psychic ghost was used  this was a statement that whole Unova is substandard(all laugh) and when these 3 were checked they said all substandard food not the girlfriends(all burst into laughter) this meant they were eternally waiting for the elusive sinister(all laugh) and thus was getting frustrated(all laugh) and this was the only way to tame them down so they realized that the master uses girlfriends to tackle the bunch(all laugh) which cemented the playboy image cause to them wisdom dawned that only one girlfriend isn’t suitable then(all burst into laughter) and the master posed in tea shirts(all laugh) like the whole world we thought your bunch should be killed immediately(all laugh) which was defended against by many gym leaders there in Unova itself who said then we’ll quit too(all laugh) else our bunch will kill us cause they tried to recruit them endmatch(all burst into laughter) and we’re so happy that you didn’t care about the rest of Cerulian else all those lunatics would’ve been roaming around freely at night to check each door if the chosen girlfriend was there to be hunted down(all laugh) so we were granted our lives(all laugh) and that Solgaleo was the one which the master himself in press so jovially said that just his little Solgy(all burst into laughter) so that was enough for the world to know that this is something else(all laugh) and we realize if anyone says terminate the bunch within next 6 another set will be created(all laugh) thus all pokemons have to be terminated means all of us will be begging from door to door next year(all laugh) while you will rule over us still according to obvious logic(all laugh) and then all knew who imagined about such absurd translators(all laugh) and so on the philosophical ideas and so on yeah people can say many things even try to be Gengar but expecting a Gengar will return more enlightening facts on the same is just Gengar(all burst into laughter)that none sane would try to do(all laugh) so we realized along with whole world it's about keeping safe distance away from Gengars(all laugh) and if they enter your room pray just that they let you be sad(all laugh)and then the Cerulian leader there was nowhere found(all laugh) so to find the leader out(all laugh) people were curious like her own family(all laugh) then we went there and the Viridian Lake was poured upon us(all laugh) then we were curious as you returned by then all this water gym story was world famous(all laugh) and we knew the gym leader was lost totally in bushes(all laugh) as may be were you(all laugh) so nothing worked then the undercover came around and none in the world knew where you were so then we thought that you’re not returning(all laugh) so we in illusion went to Kanto(all laugh) to try to win the league as normal workmen do(all laugh) and thought may be you will be forgotten as part of the infatuation(all laugh) but infact you were under the cover the actual place for your bunch cause that meant Team Rocket will themselves run up the cover and surrender(all laugh) and a Crawdaunt and Feraligator did it but jovially(all laugh) cause as we said that we heard Feraligator was told to surpass the despondency of being so(all burst into laughter) and Crawdaunt was told to pierce through the Crawdaunt that's not so(all burst into laughter) hence they made the rocket boss turn on his HUMAN condition(all laugh) which proved that you can do anything you want as you just befriended Team Rocket to happily surrender(all laugh) and that's Gengar(all laugh) but after coming up to the cover you mouthed the whole world off saying everyone was after your bunch(all laugh) so they had to stay alive themselves(all laugh) and thus didn’t do anything which was great cause we thought you may release your bunch in wild which by now would've long forced all out of this profession(all laugh)anyway,then we won the Kanto unfortunately the final round was against a Solgaleo managed by 5 time champ(all laugh) in her last to even break her dreams of progessing(all laugh) and so we were so confident that by now you were send off to mars(all laugh) cause none sane would want a playboy whoose bunch is mad after girlfriends(all burst into laughter) so we returned happily with the trophy and then by this time the leader was showing signs of moving on by getting the you quota down to 7 from 9 out of 10(all laugh) so we had a few chats which proved that you were nicest but not so so(all laugh) anyway so later we were familier in the meantime a few other men were there who each got 2 dates each to discuss about you(all laugh) each time only to have their manhoods questioned and thus was off before getting readied to go out of the house even(all laugh) so we were left as the poor samples(all laugh) and  by now you stared to do what you did with us with your Tauros(all laugh) so we thought definitely the playboy is dangerous(all laugh) and then we had chats and all and in the meantime the gentleman finally got married(all laugh) so now none of the sisters were there and we met Brock after saving ourselves from Salamences(all laugh) and then we were further taken to the friendship and all and then he opined that we were the poor samples indeed(all laugh) thus that quote and we after all marriages of all others tried our hands at removing the second cousin mask(all laugh) before this we asked for dates twice but was politely called off as we were nothing to you(all laugh) besides to tell you none of us or other men ever were approached at all or asked for dates though we were told your case was exactly the opposite(all laugh) so by the way the second time we were compared to you was not received well by the head(all laugh) so we were invited to the gym(all laugh) and then we’re sure you have had innumerable sketchs of yourself(all laugh) i said,’yeah i’ve had my days under the sky(all laugh) go on long discourses are what i prefer for the purpose of fun of being Gengar(all laugh) i’m sure you are yourselves realizing why Gengar is a funny creature(all laugh) said,yeah most certainly and this our women can’t take sadly too fond(all burst into laughter) i said,only cause it i guess may be just about a couple of months ago the confessions were(all burst into laughter) said,no about one(all burst into laughter) they know everything yet are afraid to know all so that they are clarified more(all laugh) i said,don’t bother post marriages you will have ample time and no for this marriages aren’t harmed unless before two months post the lunar phase(all laugh) said,no we agree but you see the 1 years is so great(all laugh) that the previous is seeming so funny yeah life is strange(all burst into laughter) i said yeah all related to age(all burst into laughter) said,yeah anyway so we asked for a sketch as by then we were forced to get arranged(all laugh) but the sketches don’t come while the gentleman comes out with flying colours(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollably laughs and Tracey laughs shaking his head) so now as we get the full picture we’re saying but before that to clarify the before realization parts to us it was that you had overgrown this world of our profession and may be thus had gone to mars and the trouble was that you could’nt except mentally so we thought of no hope for you(all laugh) and well about the match you know well why we went there but we thought the public humiliation and all plots may get you insecured and all and the talks were to make you so but we got the same re[peated lines so no progess could be made(all laugh) and our bunch told us that your Tauros has no connection to you what so ever(all laugh) and you could talk with our Kyogre better than us despite Tauros(all laugh) we realized that whole world has become a psychic game to you(all laugh) so may be Mewtwos is herds may not be even given a pokemon to begin with for you to tame them(all laugh) cause you yourself are a 50 times bigger herd of Gengars(all laughs) and the trouble for all is that even if they try and so on in battles and all a 16 year old goes out to journey what’s his goal i want to be a Gengar(all burst into laughter) so that is something that you can’t have any feelings about exactly as would be a Gengar(all laugh) so this life of Gengar is truely amusing there are other ghosts even Sableye(all laugh) we ourselves have one(all burst into laughter) but still he and they have some reservations and all even Haunter does and Gengars as well(all laugh) but the full Gengar(all burst into laughter) that is a being who roams around not knowing anything at all(all laugh) and yes the important thing another is that from the gym leader on your performances not much was opined but it was said that your Glalie mind the tense is so cute(all burst into laughter) and your Kalos final victory was sweet(all laugh) then we played the sentimental card(all burst into laughter) cause we knew that before next millennia none is doing that final again(all laugh) cause afterwards Gengar said this urge to know is cause the definition of knowing not being as clear to them as much as is tickling isn't it(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) and then just the thought(all laugh) but later confirmed cause later the Noivern was tested cause others 73 did the same but never the pokemons were in such plight(all laugh) and Gengar was cause first Sabrina is one of the greatest names of all times even may be and now for sure and she said gravely that, that Gengar scared his own mom a bit who is legendary herself(all laugh) she said this is a record of frivolity(all laugh) and second said that Gengar made even a person like her think twice about why afterlives should be properly directed cause this brat got a wrong body and hence has become extremely jovial cause now he can directly fool around without any limits(all laugh) and most heinously show others(all laugh) third the Gastly became Haunter in the earliset possible time which is a record by an unthinkable margin to begin with(all laugh) and said he evolved cause his mom told him do you know what is agitative reverse tickling(all burst into laughter) he said hence i evolved cause i said look kid(all burst into laughter) your idea of agitative reverse is to give the most obvious way of representing two negetives so you get only tickling thus you get no progress in tickling so your tickling becomes stale hence you're caught in a bondage of specification of evolution(all laugh) then he evolved himself saying you agitated me by saying two negetives so i reversed it to two positives that is agitative tickling of reversal(all burst into laughter) that is against your negative-negetive-positive now is negative-neutral-dubious hence could be anything(all laugh) and thus this iead of reversal vs reverse is why evolution is no good neither is life cause they are rather frivolus and yet not self established(all burst into laughter) in tickling that is(all burst into laughter) cause reverse is an action that you produce or may be spontaneous like tickling of course(all burst into laughter) but reversal is the holisstic view when you know revering is as well inbuilt thus if you know that none tickles none that is if i tickle you and i don't know me or you then only tickling is left ain't it(all burst into laughter) this idea that i tickle or get tickled is the most dreadfull hindrence to that type of tickling(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)
and then Sabrina said this pest stayed on as a Haunter cause to him he won't evolve more unless he gets that feeling(all laugh) and most dreadfully during the only breeding season that this meance was there,he scoffed at everyone saying this tickling is the confinement of the full tickling cause you depend on others to tickle you despite knowing they expect the same from you thus an idea of duty,you see kids no good is this responsible tickling(all burst into laughter) cause when i was Gastly different kids came to me i tickled them they did the same we went to competitions and so on but all are an hindrence to that greatest tickling isn't this cause you're responsible for yourself or your partner to tickle more where's more or less in tickling(all burst into laughter) hence why bother about them at all(all laugh) hearing this heinous philosophy and impending doom for sanity(all laugh),his mom ever told me this meance isn't happy at all cause he can't unleash which is better not to be discussed(all laugh) get my master in he gives this freedom why i myself have unleashed upto this(all laugh) but this pest wants that perfect tickling(all laugh) so he will get extremely agitated and try to drag you to certain planes to compell you to invent ideas of tickling which he reviews(all burst into laughter) none will suit him and all of us including you will go mad(all laugh) else this pest will get more philosophical and drag everyone with him to become totally mad(all laugh) then you went there and asked this pest what is the difference between being and becoming vs knowing and understanding(all burst into laughter) the answer then wasn't given may we know(all laugh),i said,yeah sure later he evolved into Gengar and said being and becoming are contradictory to each other while being necessary and the second is just the same and then the two cross each other out hence the establishment of life i was trying to find is in the fullest possible tickling of self out of everything else hence i became a Gengar to tickle this idea of tickling to renovate it in essence(all burst into laughter) they said,yeah we see why professionally crooked gentlemen are indespensible to your bunch(all laugh),i said yeah,you see among them the first one says this idea of existence is so intricately ingrained in this feeling of the same(all brust into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) and his soulmate says,this idea of expression of being is so maddening that this makes you surpass the barrier of space and time(all burst into laughter,Violet in tears laughing) then the 2nd step says this idea of perfection is so intriguing that you run after that automatically growing in it getting established to present a being that gets most perfect by each surpassing days of each year(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing,Daisy in tears laughing) hence will ushurp your whole being with all the days to make sure you're only the one in all the days(all burst into laughter) and his soulmate says,this idea of appearence and reality that is seen and then deciphered or the attempt is there to do the same is ingrained in the fact that you want more and only settle for the most perfection which will appears as a jackal to make the appearence to get the reality most enjoying(all burst into laughter,Daisy in fits and tears of laughter,Tracey uncontrollbaly laughs) then there's the obvious last step(all laugh) what should be order sis(all laugh).."
Lillie(laugh) : "yeah the reverse wigging that's the unfoldment of the wig represents what is the most engaging(all burst into laughter)"
Ash(laugh) : "on-the-fly yeah(all burst into laughter)"
Gary(laugh) : "man this pest would've ruined my moments(all laugh)"
Lillie(laugh) : "AH!THAT INNOCENT SMILE OF GEETING CAUGHT THAT BLUSH!SO ENDEARING(all burst into laughter)"
Ash(laugh) : "Mr Oak why is called that type of blush(all brust into laughter)"
Gary(laugh) : "yeah,your Gyarados including herself didn't even spare you that time either(all brust into laughter)"
Ash(laugh) : "just so naive(all laugh,Ash and Misty smiles at each other)..anyway,so yeah this is the same,actually(all laugh) the next wigged step says,this idea of being is wigging the self hence only wait letting all wigs flow by you being self established as much as possible till that type of baldening wig is found(all brust into laughter,Lillie in tears laughing,Gary shakes his head laughing) thus your being and self will mix together to produce the real wig of reality that's what Crawdauntogator asserts in joviality(all burst into laughter) then the final step of course is so sweetening(all laugh)..that is best decribed actually from my bunch's point of view(all laugh) they with that say(all laugh)..

Wake up to that maddening tune(all laugh)! the song that had its birth
Far off, where the taint of being could never reach(all laugh)
In mountain caves and glades of forest deep(all laugh)
Where we got confined to this being(all laugh)
only to be released have we come as knew this before we were born(all laugh)
that we will sing high that note,
Mr Oak OH MR OAK!(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly in tears of laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)

Strike off the self fetters that bind thee down to sanity(all laugh)
Of all that's the duality's song(all laugh)
Hence turn on your being to be free(all laugh)
and tell Mr Oak that Mr Oak despite our master we'll be here after lifelong(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)"

Let despondency of that type go(all burst into laughter)
the will-o'-the-wisp that leads
With blinking light to pile more gloom of being or just that self maddening tune.(all burst into laughter)
This thirst for being,for ever quench ; this dragging
From birth to death, and death to birth, the soul.(all laugh)
He counters all who counters the self by the self(all laugh)
Know this And never let us yield(all burst into laughter) 
Cause you can't help it till you go insane(all laugh)
and then let the whole existence say,
Mr Oak OH where's thou now why is it called MR OAK(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laugh)
After this life again may be
we'll come to repeat this when you decide you'll be(all burst into laughter)
see i can't let you off either cause you are me(all burst into laughter)
thus Mr Oak in any birth first say whoose Gary this is Mr Oak can't you see(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollaly laughs in tears of laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)..

this is one more a toast for the epitome of the Oak Labs(all laugh)

There ain't no grave can hold my body down(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing)
There ain't no grave can hold my body down
When I hear that maddening sound I'm gonna rise right out of the ground(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)
Ain't no grave can hold my body down(all laugh)
Well,look way down the future(all laugh)
what do you think I see?(all laugh)
I see a band of angels(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing) but they're coming after me(all uncontrollbaly laugh,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs in tears and fits of laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)
Ain't no being can hold my self down(all laugh)
Mr Oak There ain't no being that Mr Oak can hold our insanity down(all laugh)
Well, look down no more yonder Giraora(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)
put your feet on this lab and see(all laugh)
And Darkramar please you blow your trumpet as Mr Oak my name you heard it from me(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs)
There ain't no being Mr Oak can hold Mr Oak down(all laugh)
Ain't no being can hold my future from getting spoiled down(all brust into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs,Gary shakes his head laughing)
Well, meet me Rayquaza(all laugh), meet me Dragonite Meet me in the middle of the air Latios(all burst into laughter)
And as these beings fail me(all burst into laughter) I will meet you anywhere sorry nowhere(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)
Ain't no grave can't hold Gary down(all laugh)
But There ain't no grave can hold Mr Oak down(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing)
Well, meet me mother and father, meet me down the Unova-Kalos border road(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs in tears laughing,Gary shakes his head laughing)
And momma you know that I'll be there like uncle when I check out of the Huntelion road(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs in tears laughing)
But unlike uncle Ain't no being can hold my Kommo-O down(all laugh)
And There ain't no being can hold us from going to Venturiastrog down(all laugh)
And call at this time cause There ain't no other time that can hold my parents naivety down(all burst into laughter,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs,Brock shakes his head laughing)...

So later then i guess,bye(all laugh and reciprocate and bye)..."

......................................
(2 days later,night,middle)

Ash(laugh) : "yeah,so then beautiful men continues,anyway,so unfortunately both Gengar and Noivern was thought of as good sample to test(all laugh)unfortunate for the researchers that is(all laugh) as the dragonic sample said this confinement that i’ve been forced to makes me to think about the thoughts that are coming to me through ages whenever i’ve felt such a thought in the thoughts of the thought that what is a confinement at all(all burst into laughter) what is this idea of thought of a confinement that confines the thoughts of the thought of own thoughts on own thoughts to add to the basic thought of what is a thought to begin with who we are how we know hey are you thinking on your thoughts(all burst into laughter) humans fled the scene what to speak of pokemons cause they understood a dark dragon with that power of thoughts can send them to various thoughts from which there’s no return cause there only can but will they know the real tickling(all burst into laughter) and this dragon and the Gengar were brought there by the gentleman(all burst into laughter) who said solemnly to leave these meances to thoughts of tickling(all laugh) only upon his master’s thoughtfull antics(all laugh) who said then just my Nivy(all laugh) and Gengy(all burst into laughter) as he said just my Cozy(all burst into laughter) Cozy said so many specifications this moment then no more the signals so dense(all laugh) truely it would please me why is it so being HUMAN(all brust into laughter) humans fled immediately cause Cozy was none other than the psudo-legendary dark-ghost-steel-psychic-dragon named Ultranercozma(all laugh) if that name and type strenghts weren't cozy enough this meance was straight out of Team Rocket's very own den(all laugh) so she knows many things about human-pokemon interactions that better be not discussed exactly why she is desperate to show them to HUMANS(all laugh) and yeah human was there of course(all laugh) who solemnly pointed out he has had to use every unimaginable medicines possible each day after work cause the humanization has happened only at his cost(all laugh) and later we’ve all been informed about the lack of concentration on the differetiation of the thoughts on bro and beau thoughts(all burst into laughter) that really helped us to laugh all off(all laugh) and same as our soulmates thus infact it helps(all laugh) but anyway,so if you were out of millennia(all laugh) and that was the trouble to begin with then we thought as we said to decide(all laugh) and all else were by then off so we were left thus we were burgaining(all laugh) i said,well about thoughts(all laugh) it’s what my Noivern does as he is born like that and i just communicate for them(all burst into laughter) and Gengar too for sure(all laugh) but do you know about hall of famers and so on when you were there and an issue whith the Frucient gym there cause i heard a few were naive(all laugh) said,no as far as we were concerned till the time none except us and the other few that we spoke of cause the skill level simply cause now as good as hall of fame in our profession if not just a 6+ times champ but we never thought anything less than a 5 time champ then cause wasn’t in hall of fame yet and with the personal troubles but that rather helped to accelerate we guess cause the battling was relief with Glalie’s memories(all burst into laughter,.) how is your assesment? I said,first i have a question that what if the whole pokemon world each professional becomes a Gengar(all burst into laughter) surely first whole world will try to join in and if fails cause it’s not easy(all laugh) then still the money will flow into each home in oceans won’t it(all laugh) said,yeah sure that’s the kids are aiming at now starting with a Duskull(all burst into laughter) and hence the number will get lessened and yeah the money for sure(all laugh),i said,yeah i thought so as well(all laugh) and about assesment of this gym leader well if with me would’ve won Johto and me Orange and then Hoenn would’ve been a toss so we would’ve parted if we wanted that goal most and she would’ve been in Frontier then Hoenn then Sinnoh then Kalos then Unova and would’ve won if only this order she followed not anything else(all laugh) and i would’ve been at Hoenn,Sinnoh,Frontier,Unova,Kalos which would’ve fetched the same result for me then in Elite4 we would’ve been in different months so my result barring Lance would’ve been same as you know Lance is a man that i respect too much for my bunch’s liking(all laugh) and thus the Kanto Elite4 match has been played out like that on Lance’s insistance(all laugh) and she would’ve got 5-2 would’ve won against Persy but not Ivana cause Ivana is too intuitive and Lance no i don’t see that one Persy was in that mood got Lance 5th won so yeah a 6,5 Hall of Fame definitely and without me(all laugh)...well(all burst into laughter),if my path was followed would’ve only got the Hoenn interesting but the rest two next i don’t see and the last two isn’t proper(all laugh) but at Hoenn might’ve been a draw or she would’ve won then i would’nt have been hall of fame at all totally different career but my bunch would’ve still become thus just after Hoenn itself(all laugh) and then it’s a matter of safety(all laugh) cause the number of pokemons with me would’ve been all the highest evoluted pokemons of all types(all laugh) then the hall of fame would’ve told me to quit the porfession cause fisrt i would’ve had enough to create a Oak lab in double size than the current(all laugh) and then my full bunch would’ve made any authority or tags or class totally meaningless(all laugh) but then for her a 7-0,6-1 definitely but only if she didn’t make the mistake of going to Unova before Kalos as only in the last two the 7th and 8th must’ve been Kalos and Unova reverse order Unova won’t be won,Kalos toss with 60% negetive bias at normal finish time if prolonged no chance(all laugh) and yeah if Sinnoh after Hoenn in any cases other than first 4 with me as number 5th and not 6th after Hoenn at 4th and was the 3rd title would’ve abjectly lost(all laugh) but if i never existed then it would’ve been(all laugh)..yeah,this one is ok cause this is theory(All laugh)...right(all burst into laughter),so if that case then Kanto,Orange,Johto must’ve been followed if Johto before Orange would’ve lost both unless Hoenn was tried before Orange to get Orange(all laugh) but still Kalos and Unova 7th and 8th must(all laugh) so lets say the two possibilities
Kanto,Orange,Johto,Hoenn,Frontier,Sinnoh,Kalos,Marriage(all laugh)..ok,ok(all laugh),no really you know Trace and Brock certainly had to themselves get their soulmates to look at them themselves after quarrel(all laugh) Mr Oak Mr Oak neutral(all laugh) Dave and Zara too neutral same sort of ways and the shrew was the Drew kind(all laugh) but i was first day totally gobbled up(all laugh)..right(burst into laughter),so my Gyaradosey flower was totally mad for my preparation even(all laugh) and since then just my Ash and that’s it(all laugh) by-the-way before Brawn’s den(all laugh) i tried unknowlingly at the jealousy trick(all burst into laughter and .,Brock cheers for Candice,who is described,Misty scoffs at Brock,all laugh even more)..so Candice was a trainer met them in the pokecentre and all and had a one on one there was there for my Bulbasaur and Squirtle who injured each other too much the day i got Squirtle(all laugh) and then i just afterwards said yeah nice gril good match i had nice to meet her(all laugh) HOW DARE YOU PRAISE THAT NAMCALL(all burst into laughter) I’M A WAY BETTER THAN HER AT WATER TYPES(all laugh)..nice girl..nice(all laugh)..I LOOK WAY BETTER THAN HER(all burst into laughter) AND I’LL NEVER BE NICE TO YOU UNLESS YOU REPAY..um..(all burst into laughter)..NEVER EVEN IF YOU REPAY(all burst into laughter) then i said Misty why are you so upset we’re friends(all laugh) um..no..you..um..(all laugh)..why don’t you like me Ash(All burst into laughter) i by then more than realized what she was saying of course(all laugh) and as you know none of us wanted to get out of that shell cause we weren’t bothered about words at all even in dreams(all laugh) but then that dumb crook(all laugh) girls are hurt Ash if the heart is hurt(all burst into laughter) this sweetens up my Mist flower so much that she screechs SHUT UP(ALL LAUGH) you dumb namecall Brock(all laugh) I’M NEVER JEALOUS OF ANYONE IF MY..um..(all laugh)..JUST GET OUT(all laugh).. so then i said Misty why do you unnecessarily think these things you’re my friend and we’ll be travelling for next 2 years stop these(all laugh) um yeah,it’s just that um..(all laugh)..friends..but..only..um..(all laugh) then i said we’ll become best friends as we travel along together(all laugh) if you can continue (all laugh) SHUT UP(ALL LAUGH) i’ll always be..um..(all laugh)..I’LL ALWAYS TRAVEL WITH YOU IN THIS REGIOANL JOURNEY(all laugh) then she walked off,i knew she was too much infatuated with me by then which is why i was suspicious even more given my experiences mentally(all laugh) but then i realized that she thinks i’m her best friend(all burst into laughter and .) so beacuse i’ve got a best-girl-Misty-friend(all laugh) then she’s not a girl(all burst into laughter) thus my wife-Mist-as-best-friend-wife(all laugh) so after Viridian i said you’re my best friend(all laugh) can i call my best friend as Mist(all laugh) and ate me up almost but then at that age we just shook hands and hi fived but we were ALONE(all laugh) so the distance was just enough lone(all laugh) and that day itself as i said Mist i married Mist as well as did she if not before(all laugh) cause once she wasn’t a girl she was my best friend(all laugh)..anyway(all burst into laughter),back to beauty(all laugh) so Kalos if not married at 7th then marriage then Unova if marriage was anytime before done(all laugh) and if just before Kalos would’ve got divorced(all laugh)..no this one isn’t about my activites(all laugh) Mist would’ve been in serious trouble if she married before Kalos cause that life would’ve shocked her if Sinnoh didn’t had she got good travel companions but Mist would’ve been in hall of fame had i not existed but i just think for her if she was single was more suitable for general training like me cause you need to look after yourself the most cause all aren’t like me that i had a family member till my 7th journey but if she married or was in a relation be it in or out of profession or travel companions or not would’ve been in trouble in general training cause the cultures beyond Hoenn would’ve shocked her if not Sinnoh Unova and Kalos would’ve and she would’ve been in trouble there anyway i then continued,the second possibility is, Kanto,Johto,Hoenn,Orange,Frontier,Sinnoh then the next two but here if Sinnoh is tried before frontier lost(all laugh) if Johto before Kanto Kanto would’ve been won then same and no matter and you understand that Johto or Kanto would’ve been tried frist if Orange is first career might have been jeopardized unless good travel companions(all laugh) and so on so i gave you two main branches and then definitely 7, 5 sure Ivana toss(all laugh) so yeah hall of fame definitely but no chance of winning the first league(all laugh) and Lance as well(all laugh) then they said,well first what would it take to beat Lance and then about your assesment of your position(all laugh) i said well to beat Lance you can’t get under his skin ever(all laugh) cause he is a master of mind games himself and has been cause he himself is 8,7 champ(all laugh) and beaten during his time the unbeatable Sinnoh Elite4 head Katy of all people(all laugh) and on the way beating Laura of all legends(all laugh) his career was that he’s from Indigo Platue itself(all laugh) and his career is 1st region Kanto-win,2nd Kanto Frontier-win,3rd Johto-win,4th Orange-win upto here look at his shrewd regional selection despite getting 4 psudeo-legends in his very first region- Solgaleo,Cresselia,Kyogre and Heatran of all legends(all laugh) and still how grounded and each league got better,5th Kalos-win,Kalo of all places at 5th being from Kanto and was a big margin win against a 5 time champ in 7th region huge,6th Unova-win,7th Sinnoh-win ,8th Hoenn-win,Elite4 was Kalos-win,Sinnoh-win with Katy at number 2(all laugh),Johto-win,Unova-win his days Unova was 2nd toughest and Unova discourages it’s best champs to be Elite 4 heads else all will revolt(all laugh),Kanto-win,Hoenn-win,Orange-win and his career after Hall of Fame shows only 4 losses(all laugh) and one in last 15 and 3 in the previous 10(all laugh) out of which 1 came before being Elite4 head and in his 20 year Elite4 leadership in his first 5 years the most tumultus time as well(all laugh) and in internal matches between hall of fame which they must resist my bunch from enterning or at worst intruding(all burst into laughter) cause now intruding is what they want to increase the fun(all laugh) said,well that could be perfect Gengar version(all burst into laughter) i said,yeah but not proper at all(all laugh) anyway,Lance’s record there too is phenomenal and i don’t know the details of that much cause so much statistics is hard(all laugh) but all i know is that outside of Persy he has lost only 3 matches in last 15(all laugh) that too 1 against Katy and another two i can’t recall but a legendary name again so you understand how good he is that his average of total loss is one in 3.72 years(all laugh) and the only reson people don’t call him a legend and so on is because he’s against all those that are bigger legends than any in authority sections(all laugh) so Lance can only be beaten but every time so(all laugh) if only he is raced indifferently(all burst into laughter) that is cause Lance’s mindset is to enjoy a long comeptitive race with many mind games and in the end whatever be the result hug-it-out(all laugh) so that is to be countered by being dejected and joyous at life at the same time(all burst into laughter) to confuse him about the purpose of racing(all laugh) cause the competition is that the opponent wants to discuss philosophy as well during race while patting Lance’s bunch to the finish line to see if they understood that win and loss didn’t really matter(all burst into laughter) disconnect his bunch from him by saying like my beau left me(all burst into laughter) but no not what you think just died aged(all uncontrollbaly laugh,.) but yeah the other one i’m interested in no a days for the illegal bit(all uncontrollbaly laugh) has a few kids who are rather well behaved for their age(all burst into laughter) this if continues like this would give a symbol that the race isn’t a factor cause my bunch is indifferent to life enjoying the race AS the life not WITH the life that’s the difference(all laugh) so if so it means racing as life in their sense is that as their life goes on the race to to their job and so long a prolonged life and in human life and theirs it’ll decimate the battle instinct(all laugh) and Lance will have to budge cause his bunch will tell him that why are you not allowing us to give a thought on thought that life is long with turns if not twists(all uncontrollbaly laugh,.) then your bunch should feed the twists too to rev it up(all burst into laughter) and so on just make the race mental(all laugh) thus they are lost in thoughts are if the thoughts are interesting to them to get indifferent to things like battling Lance isn’t helping them ever(all laugh) but thus you see that is the method and you understand the preparation is very hard(all laugh) said,yeah that’s the psychic game we were thinking of that you and your bunch was playing and every bit is true but exactly if these are said to the press by a Gengar(all burst into laughter) then the result is like you and your bunch but what if it’s applied on you(all laugh) i sadi,yeah well about Gengars telling philosophy i guess as you said and if this is applied aginst my bunch they will be too jovial joking about remembreing that the dead beau said to propel the next that bit higher and so on(all burst into laughter,.) and thus yeah they are just playfull so the challenger too will be playfull and thus then it’s level ground where the one that fools around longer will win and that’s my bunch won me Orange so many years ago(all laugh and .) so no the uniqueness of the bunch is a matter but what matters is how much a Gengar the master is(all burst into laughter) which again will first inherent qualities then about situations like i’ve had peace at home to continue my journey and so on and yeah to me since my 2nd league and certainly after Hoenn it was the mental game that is no energy wasted cause i’m not battling at all(all laugh and .) so yeah even a Gyarados could thus be beaten by Weavile of all(all laugh) the McShin miracle(all laugh) said,yeah somehow the preparation is strange(all laugh) and we think that even if you tell everything to others exactly what a Gengar does(all burst into laughter) cause a Gengar doesn’t think to hide cause it doesn’t know what is hiding as it’s never serious and doesn’t know what is thinking(all burst into laughter) so yeah life is twists and turns of Gengar(all laugh) and thus so hard to do in a millenia(all laugh) i said well millennia is just a number but in next year someone would come up with this but you see if two Gengars meet never can a battle happen so neither he or she nor me can be beaten at all cause that makes no sense at all(all laugh and .) said,yeah but we don’t believe that anyone in last millennia shared your thoughts if not 1500(all laugh) or even if did it was theory(All laugh) so yeah strange thing but what about your career assesment with and without the gym leader(all laugh) and ours too(all burst into laughter) i said,well first you careers i’m seeing you after one year and this is 5th meeting or 8th (all burst into laughter) so i might be absolutely wrong and i saw only so few from your bunch and so on so yeah hard but i guess i know that water gym was selected cause first sentiments but more so as my bunch was Tyranitar and Solgaleo and Yveltal and so on(all laugh) though they are nasty but not as nasty as Crawdauntogator is(all burst into laughter) none is infact(all laugh) and Crawdaunt is still more well behaved than Feraligator(all laugh) who is less nasty than Crawdaunt(all burst into laughter) and so on so they are real meance to peace but if Yveltal wants he can match them as can any(all laugh) but that is if they are in the mood these two always are(All laugh) but these are barring my ghost group(all laugh) but they aren’t nasty they are just frivolus beyond imagination(all laugh) but that can be as nasty as well(all laugh) but all these excludes Gengar and Sableye and Darkrai and Giratina and Confragigus and Hoopa and of course Ultranercozma(all laugh) so you see that i like this exact thinking process from my point of view and then if i were at your situation cause Crawdauntogator beat team rocket and the 3 psudeo lenegds were so mad battling that much fun they can have now and the ghosts are ghosts(all laugh) so then yeah my thinking to go to a water gym was right but to engage my bunch in a longer fun was to select a grass gym(all laugh) cause they want to eat the food slowly in abnormal situations only(all laugh) reverse otherwise(all laugh) and then the next best option was water gym so with all the views taken my views are that starting at Johto was absolutely right and then Frontier too was extremely prudent and right then Sinnoh was all wrong(all laugh) just that idea to show more than prudence the just previous selection that Orange league was inferior to Sinnoh(all laugh) which isn’t the case at all as you now know there’s no easy leagues at all cause Unova says Kalos is child’s play thus doesn’t win at all(all laugh) and Kalos has same opinion about Kanto thus the result(all laugh) Kanto people like me think Johto is easier than Hoenn and thus i failed there(all laugh) in general Hoenn and Unova only respects Orange who has to respect all being smallest region for money(All laugh) and Kanto’s respect order is inferiors are Orange and Kalos(all laugh) Kalos most so that none bothers to go there and the vise versa despite being geographical neigbours and yet goes to Sinnoh(all laugh) which has less turns more twists and Kalos the opposite(all laugh) and the whole world is afraid Unova but i guess my bunch has mitigated that as has my dragons(all laugh) which i think has only been helpful(all laugh) for their ego and our fear especially Kanto-Johto group(all laugh) and Sinnoh fears Kanto more than Unova(all laugh) Hoenn has nightmares thinking of Unova(all laugh) and Kalos are submissive to them(all laugh) Orange are revolutionaries against them cause of the runaway groups(all laugh) and Unova looks down upon everyone most Kalos but barring Orange cause the ones they can’t catch here does from there cause the dragonic density per inhabitation is less(all laugh) and so on for all regions it’s a huge chart will take whole day(all laugh) so Orange if was tried or Hoenn for that matter would’ve got upto semi finals sure if not win and then 4th Hoenn or Sinnoh any would’ve won definitely but if Hoenn then Orange again Orange was lost(all laugh) cause the start to Hoenn was the illusion but for the right reasons of skills and thus was fine but those skills of her are no good in Orange only in general training not as a gym leader(all laugh) as a gym leader she would’ve been same everywhere barring Kalos where she isn’t a hall of famer but a very good leader only hall of famer if her husband or boyfriend is very supportive or she is single and so on(all laugh) but again totally barring Unova(all laugh) where she can’t run a gym her husband must do that or if single then take up general training or contests or anything in the world possible cause first she doesn’t know that a Palkia is tamed only if the Palkian life is allowed to be led(all laugh) that is your Palika will take you as a direct challenger(all burst into laughter) and the more you love him the more ferocious would they become(all laugh) cause the Palkian life says that we’re the only water dragon with those chosen Kyurems(all laugh) and a few Rayquaza and Naganadel and so on immitates and irritates us(all laugh) we must become lie detectors(all laugh) and love haters first thing in life(all laugh) and thus being dragons they will challenge all to appease them is to feed them with ideas(all laugh) of family infighting killing own kids and so on(all laugh) then they will become thoughtfull of you as to why are you helping them in lie detecting(all laugh) then they will take you under their scales(all laugh) to teach you properly when you must cry your head off to them using sentimental cards(all laugh) that they don’t like you(all burst into laughter) thus they will be incensed with you(all laugh) and then you repeat the procedure(all laugh and .) then they will understand that you’re as clever as them cause that’s exactly what they do(all burst into laughter) then they are tamed and thus only the water gyms in Unova are prepared(all laugh) but catching a Palkia is different it requires you to threaten them first then when they are mad flee(all burst into laughter) then they are confused a few chosen ones like in group of 10 from a group of 12(all laugh) will hunt for you to see if you still are conspiring(All laugh) then you catch one BUT only if you pat them enough that you will help them in showing the world that they don’t want love(All burst into laughter) that is to let them have their way among your bunch(all laugh) and Palikas don’t fight seriously till the lie is detected before that is just enough to make freinds and using sentiments again and again get under their scales to find the lie once found they can be unstoppable to tackle which is another epic(all laugh)..against Sharpedo this is what i was telling Dave to do(All laugh) but both of mine are absolute damn brats(all laugh)..then i continued that that is Palkian life and so on among dragons Palkia is most difficult to tame next to Giratina at 2(all burst into laughter) who can only be appeased if his full group likes you(all laugh) by tormenting you to death(all laugh) and no love their too just the fooling around with the whole world barring Latias and Latios who must be shown the better psychic plane of life first thing(all laugh) and Latios the exact same but they are happy to be ONLY with Giratinas(all burst into laughter) cause the leg pulling(all laugh) and those in Orange pull legs of Dragonites(All laugh) and so on but there is Kyurem then(all laugh) which will take another day to give their deprivation nature that the whole world is not caring to them so they are cruel to the world(all laugh) and caring means they must let them battle whole day against any steel type(all laugh) and so on Kyurem is 3rd most difficult to tame as 4th (all laugh) as they live side by side with Hydreigons(all burst into laughter) who threatens the whole world cause they don’t like kids who are all except themselves(all burst into laughter) do you understand the first(all laugh),said,yeah whole world knows that one the great dragon fight psudeo legend one and only Kommo-O(all laugh),i say,what O stands for in light(all laugh),said,well Opacity can be applied that the idea about them needs to be cleared,i say,to not disturb them while catching(all burst into laughter),they said,well then what about them(all laugh),i say,they live beside Garchomps(all laugh) and Garchomp’s motto of life is clarity in vision to decimate any approach of friendship(all laugh) thus they are easy to tame of course(all laugh) just feed them with ideas of ethics(all burst into laughter) by not challenging them but letting your Goodra roam raround amongst them(all laugh) then they will get the clear view that your Goodra is there to kill them then they won’t attack Goodra cause visibility says it’s you not Goodra(all laugh) thus they will charge at you and you must face that alone(all laugh) and call Goodra just say help if you attack you’re done(all laugh) so Goodra wants to save you to tem it means Goodra and you are clear in vision that they are no friends(all burst into laughter) then thus going after one day one decides to test you(all laugh) if you beat him with type disadvantages pokemon of hhis choosing while he will demand to see your whole bunch(all laugh) and will choose one and fight them then if beaten that vision is established that your view is clear as the fact that you’re enemy to all like them(all laugh) and then they will follow you but Kommo-O is sick of this petulance(all laugh) thus they have opacity of view to everything(all laugh) thus anything that disturbs them like a leaf falls on their head while they will shake trees(all laugh) will disturb them enough to punch the next guy(all laugh) thus the idea of any kind love and hate will be punched(all laugh) Kommo-O view of life is that i don’t understand anything thus i don’t want to either(all burst into laughter) but i can(all burst into laughter) that is if i get get my ways of understanding while punching anything(all laugh) so this is about sudden feelings only(all laugh) so if a twig falls on Kommo-O head enough to invoke a feeling he will have that feeling means he will be disturbed cause first he won’t try to understand what this feeling is so he will punch the next guy(all laugh) who will punch the next cause of a feeling(all burst into laughter) thus in cycle O will come up and the first one will get punch back finally(all laugh) which makes him understand that the first and the punching another has pained my fists(all laugh) so now i’ve got it back thus it increases from very little to max thus it’s something to be disturbed about enough to think about it(all laugh) then Kommo-O will think about it by punching the next guy even harder than first to form anti cyclic O(all burst into laughter) so by the time he has finished his own thinking he will be punched again more forcefully to make him understand that it’s a skirmish that’s going on so what exactly was the first feeling once he realizes that it was a twig it will be alright for him to tell others did you feel anything(all burst into laughter) all else sill say only a punch nothing more so he will finally understand that only on his head the twig fell but you understand sudden feelings that’s outside of body only(all laugh) will come out of blue so many times so Kommo-O gets punched say 20000 times per half day(all laugh) and own body feelings wherever the feeling is will be punched(all burst into laughter) to see if that feeling is worthy enough to put any thoughts to while it is maximized to understand the minimum feelings impact on them(all laugh) then if skirmish among group then they will do the same thing repeating till they can’t continue anymore to understand such impacts but they are self heal masteres so it will be alright and then if an outsider comes they will punch him to understand if their feeling of disturbance caused by Kommo-O gang matches the Kommo-O feeling of disturbance or not if not so and Kommo-O created more fear in them then they will lecture the guy(all laugh) if his mom or beau is there who is less vulnerable than them so that they can the more punches than them(all burst into laughter) if they say yes they will punch you again to say tell them this punch and please we invite them here(all laugh) and he will be let go of and then if he says no then only Kommo-O will sympathise by saying ok then why don’t you bring your own group rather than the dear ones(all burst into laughter) then he will cry his head off which will make Kommo-O realize that this feeling  wasn’t something they had while they started this trouble thus they will leave you saying life is hard(all burst into laughter) so you see a Kommo-O life is getting punched may be 60000 times per day(all laugh) thus when you go your bunch must disturb them long enough just in the outskirts of the inhibitation to make them feel disturbed for long enough to be not so(all burst into laughter) then a gang will come upto your pokemon and will start punch him left and right to understand the wild pokemon intruding feature till he cries then you will be summoned and your bunch will be asked to define if you’re his mommy if he says yes you will be punched(all laugh) if he says no then it means you’re a new chosen one so that same process will be applied(all laugh) thus he should only cry and not talk with you at all then Kommo-O gang will surround you(all laugh) and you must stay abolsutely silent there and they will want to know if you care about your pokemon you won’t answer anything then one of them who is too interested about your view of life(all laugh) will come beside you(all laugh) and put his tail around your shoulder(laugh,all laugh) to ask your realtion to your pokemon then you will punch yourself(all burst into laughter) and that means a disturbance that you have but Kommo-O doesn’t have cause Kommo-O first volunteered to disturb you by putting his tail around your body and asking you a question yeah if Kommo-O is asked a question he will punch the questioner to see if questioning felt the same to the questioner as it did to him else how can his answer be understood which will be re punched to validate(all burst into laughter) so then your tears Kommo-O will interpret it as you’re a sweet little Jangomo-O(all laugh) cause this phenomena is when two Jangomo-O does after hatching they will be punched by mom(all laugh) to which they will punch back if that is good enough only then mom takes you otherwise his dad will be summoned(all laugh) and so on will go on to realize whom he will suit to hand over if none is found then it’s whole group’s responsibility to protect him  till next punch(all laugh) thus any Jangomo-O who has mettle realizes the only way out of this is to punch himself(all laugh) after mommy punches him umpteenth time(all laugh) so this will mean mommy will prepare them to be Hakomo-O so that the punching ability is increased(all laugh) thus you must follow the same procedure to get a mommy for you and your bunch thus Kommo-O can’t be caught unless you go with a gang of yourself full of many pokemons and all but that will disturb Garchomp,Haxorus,Tryrunt,a few Guzzlords and so on(all laugh) like Noivern,Rayquaza a few and then Salamences are everywhere(all laugh) thus you will let Kommo-O to punch your whole bunch to get tamed and in gym he must be kept in a way so that he can lecture everyone about mettle(all laugh) by punching them(all laugh) and in initial months you will continue punching yourself to show you’re eternally a Jangomo-O so your bunch gets the Hakomo-O life not you(all laugh) so Kommo-O life is like that i met a few(all laugh) but they wisely pointed out that my bunch is already like Kommo-O gang cause they are more battle starved(all laugh) so i was spared as to i and my bunch could tell them something(all laugh) this is two gangs colliding and the way out is to tell them life is hard and leave(all laugh) that’s what we did and they did as well only then could i come out alive if you say life is hard without their permission you will be chased(all laugh) but we went right in a middle of their inhibitation(all laugh) so they understood we’re definitely philosophical about life cause that’s death(all laugh) this feeling will tell them to discuss issues that they face(all laugh) and so on so then we will become Kommo-O as well to live a few more days then the previous procedure so you see Kommo-O is something that is dangerous but all i said are my methods many people have Kommo-O but they are substandard(all laugh) this is Kommo-O max potential so such a Kommo-O will be tamed enough after sometimes to be even kept at bedroom(all laugh) if he fits there(all laugh) and then will wisely discuss with you on that day which among your bunch chosen ones punched him properly unlike your Cobalion(all burst into laughter) who is a kid so they will ask for your permission to show the Kommo-O way of life(all laugh) so if you can show him that you’re a Jangomo-O and your bunch is full mixture of all of their evolution will he be tamed cause this means he is disturbed but happy still unlike wild cause there they have to get food and all here they don’t and geeting food is to punch himself to see how hungry(all laugh) and they being psudeo-legends will continue stupendus psychic currents while doing all these(all laugh) and all these is to get him ready to be worthy enough for my bunch to take him further(all laugh) when he will be shown that we were tolerating him as little sweet Jangomo-O and so on then he will reach the max and then he doesn’t fight and will wisely say to anyone that yeah death is hard(all laugh) cause that is death to them they will be back to life if they are told death isn’t hard(all burst into laughter) which if someone manages he will not live anymore cause then Kommo-O will get the perfect student(all laugh) Kommo-O life is about 100000 punches and as many tail whips per day cause life is hard(all laugh) creatures aren’t they(all laugh),said,yeah life is hard(all burst into laughter) if one dragon takes that then a Palkia then Giratina,Kyurem,Latios,Zekrom(all laugh).. cause they cherish so much(all laugh)..and so on Unova is hard(all laugh) but we realize that that Kommo-O himself can fetch 8 leagues(all laugh) so why none came with you(all laugh),i said,no the philosophy didn’t match they thought they can’t add to our knowledge about them strangely(all laugh) so we were spared(all laugh)...now this Kommo-O Dave has one(all burst into laughter) what does he say about being sweet little Jangomo-O(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “man if this Kommo-O gets my little boy then he will become an absolute brat(all laugh) no wonder you’re a chosen brat from absurdity(all laugh) none of the dragon taming methods are true(all laugh) only applies on his own exactly why they are damn brats(all laugh) with pokemons of his own it’s dishonestly honest hallucinations(all laugh) whatever he understands after reading about them then asks his bunch(all burst into laughter) whatever there goes on then will create an intuition and go and ask Kommo-O if that’s their life(all burst into laughter) then have a discussion and Kommo-O will get to know his life and his bunch and his Misty flower everything(all laugh) then if agreement is reached they will come by themselves and with the familiarity become absolute brats(all laugh) that’s how Confragigus,Zekrom,Guzzlord,Giratina and Latios came and Gengar was asked of his opinions on life(all burst into laughter) Ultranercozma came generally cause it was too much bonhomie(all laugh) and Dave says each ghost or psychic or dark jumps on him and ghosts specially and all the time(all laugh) and each of Kalos came but Ash what can such a Kommo-O say your ideas..”
Ash(smile) : “well no it depends upon individuals but may be wth Garchomp being here and all i guess he or she would’ve said like Mr Oak Mr Oak what are doing/Oh Mr Oak please stop what what youre doing(all laugh)/Mr Oak Mr Oak why are you always so mentally busy/please Mr Oak sit down with me else mental pressure will make you crazy(all burst into laughter) he would’ve wanted Mr Oak to sit down and have a coffee with him to discuss that mental pressure like punching to understand makes life easy(all laugh) so why not you tell him what is hard life(all burst into laughter) basically he would want to take your pen up and write his own opinions there(all laugh) reverse Dialga(all laugh) you must let him tell you who you are(all laugh) cause he will show you that your life is too sweet(all laugh) cynical brat like Ribombee and Yveltal but will tell you in clear language his minute opinions of your life like each moment how i’m thinking of bodyslamming my Mist flower or viseversa so that bodyslamming is easy for us why don’t we punch each other for a change(all laugh) then bodyslamming is more reved up to increase that FEELING(all laugh) methods to make your life hard cause it’s too easy(all laugh) all this to so you now he is dead cause he has moved over even hard life so circular reverse Dialga about as thorough as Zygarde more radical than Ribombee and less abstract than Yveltal(all burst into laughter) better not go anywhere near him but he would get the one and only Doctor Slate(all laugh) cause if life then that FEELING(all laugh) and Brock what about my failed attempt to get a Kommo-O thrice(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “they had a feeling that they are better being spared this life(all laugh) he went to most dreadful,average and most less dense inhibitations of dragons threatening Cili(all laugh) each took 5.5 days as you know he says since Frontier(all laugh) so 19*16.5 total 314 days and had thus 13 spared day(all burst into laughter) and this actually was more cause Noivern came may be 5 days after start(all laugh) and then anyway,had couple of weeks or so left got to Ultranercozma most dense area didn’t work cause his brat wasn’t there(all laugh) and then Huntelion and else didn’t go so this was after Garchomp and 6 months around after that so only 1 month was left said,’Cili we’re hungry(all laugh) all these dragons came but Kommo-O(all laugh)..’ Cilan before that took him once where Kommo-Os fled the scene cause he went with Weavile(all burst into laughter) then another was when he went with Torterra(all burst into laughter) but Torterra was so dangerous that even Kommo-Os said enough(all laugh) now these two were lest and middle dense the most infamous pokemon inhibitation pushing even Karapaskar to 2(all laugh) is Huntelion Valley,Jyriesleaf,Unova where none goes even pokemons(all laugh) except Garchomp of course(all laugh) and innumerable many but all are damn dragons(all laugh) like Tryrunt and Haxorus(all laugh) a few Guzzlords(all laugh) and of course Noivern,Rayquaza and Salamence(all laugh) so that was left and Cilan said then he wasn’t in even talking terms(all laugh) and was talking about cooking and all Iris was calling home 5 times a day(all laugh) and all else were counting the time to finals when this brat leaves the poor dragons(all laugh) comes up and says that Cilan said i begged him that man please you just return to ‘mam safely just 1 more month do as many gyms(all laugh) but please not that devil straight out of hell(all laugh),’Cili the longing the longing(all burst into laughter)’,Cilan said i told him look Kommo-O is the most loathed sepecis anywhere in the world cause their life is punch eat punch repeat(all laugh) those brats punch the next guy while sleeping if doesn’t get punched back wakes up(all burst into laughter) and if normally wakes up punches others to see if only his sleep has been disturbed(all burst into laughter) and no Kommo-O is no harm to you but you made me immortal by making me sympathize for them(all burst into laughter) cause none ever did that and if that brat enters your gang and will take one week to get battle starved and then reach the most lunacy right on the final day then please poekmons have families(all burst into laughter) and i know you,you will go to Huntelion with Noctowl(all burst into laughter),’No alone(all burst into laughter)’,Cilan thought finally he has gone truely mad so said mate plase we need to talk(all laugh),’kryopthic-liftus-kranptomos-logzysic-menrorufsmos-sychogomic-SUBTLE body(all burst into laughter) recently found has to test(all laugh)’,this is Kommo-O known highest subtle body possibility in their psychic spheres if it’s applied on a normal human being(all laugh) when they are most swelled up(all laugh) but if with Ash it would’ve become Umbronapthagum max normal(all laugh)’,so Cili said please atleast leave one dragon not come with you if of all it’s a Kommo-O they will ban you for sure cause that devil will will enter the commentary box cause he would’ve been disturbbed by the sound(all laugh) and all you need to do is to release him and say please calm down(all laugh) that means he will set out to judge who else is more calm than him beyond death(all laugh) then will ask for their relations(all laugh) said please man not that devil(all laugh),Cili sweet kids(all laugh) i’m going two days later don’t you cherish me(all laugh) then went there Noctowl was with him of course(all laugh) but only as a protection(all laugh) and Cili and Iris was protected on baloon used binoculars(all laugh) that valley is adventure horror(all laugh) so a bit is used to show people how dangerous pokemons are so that less number of people become trainers cause keeping dragons in gyms is costly(all laugh) and Cilan and Iris their protection was Hoopa and Aegislash(all laugh) they hired a balloon by their identity(all laugh) Chu was with Cilan(all laugh) and Charizard in the ball with Cilan(all laugh) and won’t come out at all if he released would immediately return(all laugh) and Noctowl was of course there(all laugh) at a bit lower in altitude and Noctowl’s vision was used so that any trouble she could spot(all laugh) was connected to Confragigus newfound power then(all laugh) and he there only had only Confragigus(all laugh) who was may be 14 month old(all laugh), went on Charizard strainght jumped into the middle(all laugh) then he went there came back Cili could hardly watch after a whole Kommo-O gang surrounded him(all laugh) then he comes back with Noctowl on Charizard again then says like,Ah!Cili where am i(all laugh),Cilan didn’t know what to do(all laugh) said,Ah!that medicine i told you 30 brats fondled my nerves for 15 minutes each 6 times with 5 minute breaks(all burst into laughter) then gets medicines which were illegal(all laugh) and was dissapointed said went with them in subtle spheres these brats didn’t want to be my family(all burst into laughter) Confragigus facilitated the meeting from my side and i was alone first time with totally wild pokemons that too Kommo-O(all laugh) previously i had a pokemon to show them why they are with me this time they themselves realized what i’m(all laugh) but they misbehave in subtle bodies sweet little kids so innocent(all burst into laughter) total two hours and 35 minutes was with them nice society,thoughtfull governance(all burst into laughter) 15 minutes they gauged me then meeting then after two hours i was realeased(all laugh) still passed 10 more minutes to get back to senses(all laugh) then saw them off in last 5 and returned they offered me foods and drinks though(all uncontrollbaly laugh) but i had to decline saying won’t be able to digest they were sympathetic said yeah we understand life is hard(all burst into laughter) but didn’t get any response though i said this this my bunch does and what is their life they spoke of their life and asked about my family and health(all burst into laughter) but it just didn’t materialize that deal to live together(all burst into laughter) they said no i can’t do much for them and viseversa in terms of happiness(all laugh) the agreement didn’t happen the aparment sharing that is(all burst into laughter) nice persons good family has kids much reponsibility yeah told me so true life is hard Cili indeed(all burst into laughter) Confragigus connected Ash to Kommo-O gang and then Ash spoke with them letting wild pokemons fondle his nevers(all laugh) that too of all in this world had to be Kommo-O at Huntelion(all laugh) no wonder his bunch is vulgar(all laugh) then after Kommo-O rejected him did he become sad before that was mad(all laugh) and Ash says as you know first Garchomp hesitated then Kommo-O said nothing he can add to(all laugh) meant he was dishonest and Mist flower was Misty Waterflower so fled(all laugh) Cilan says that day i understood i must flee the next day morning after the finals(all laugh) more than 1400 years ago Tryvon Hans Kenneth Moulier(all laugh) could do what Ash was upto(all laugh) all in Unova knows his name and no he wans’t a trainer like us of course(all laugh) nothing much is known about him just that he specialized in fighting types and specially Kommo-O fighting(all laugh) and is a mythical name at Unova to the known spheres and Cili said may be that man is communicating with Ash(all laugh) he told Ash who said i see if we could talk then the lives would’ve been known to me more,inspiration Cili inspiration,real inspiration(all laugh) but was there gyms then Cili(all burst into laughter) Cilan said if the two met Unova would’ve given up their pokemon profession completely(all laugh) but that was his first attempt then Kalos each came like that(all laugh) but he took his gang there around the inhibitation then fooled around with them those attracted themselves came(all laugh) then was rejected(all burst into laughter) with those who didn’t want to go new pokemons like Heatran(all laugh) after Heatran was with him for 2 days 3rd  day the penultimate day of 8(all laugh) will be with Heatran to Heatran home(all laugh) again subtle body BUT by Heatran(all burst into laughter) Musharna stayed with Heatran cause she was only 2 days old(all laugh) so might have troubles reading Ash thus Musharna was there to help them(all laugh) if necessity arose only(all laugh) and he will speak with all other Heatrans(all laugh) that their friend is with him is he not a Heatran as well as a Musharna as well(all laugh) thus is proved he can be with many beaus(all laugh) own untamed pokemon of 2 days first doing his subtle body and then at own home(all laugh) and you know what Heatran home is(all laugh) and his facilitator was suspicious of him(all laugh) Musharna was only there to tell Heatran if anything was needed(all laugh) and if Musharna attacked anyone Ash wou’ve been lost in darkness(all laugh) so Musharna was under pressure as well but that Musharna was this one fire can talk(all laugh) so himself didn’t bother about master brat cause they know once Heatran has come by herself won’t leave cause outside only substandard food is there(all laugh) Confragigus could still save Ash cause he was his own pokemon despite being attacked cause he knew Ash’s state and was extremely lunatic then thus around Xormnuh(all laugh) and then if he was attacked Noctowl would’ve helped(all laugh) but if Musharna wasn’t connected to him only Heatran thus if he tried much his own Heatran might’ve sent him off to cosmic darkness(all laugh) a commitee was formed of 20 Kommo-Os(all laugh) while 10 went to communicate(all laugh) each group communicated thrice(all laugh) 30 Kommo-Os fondled his nerves for 90 minutes(all laugh) and all those 30 yere full grown chosen brats(all laugh) and Heatran was 2.5 full hours with coffee(all laugh) went one full extra hour with untamed pokemon(all laugh) no wonder these brats are so happy here(all laugh)..they know him and the viseversa inside out(all laugh) and most unfortunately by him and own familiarity us too(all laugh) and now our kids as well..really i’m scared with that vulgarity(all laugh) just imagine the beauty will eventually come back home and is asked did you properly tickle like your parents do(all burst into laughter)..that will be enough for them to search for soulmates only(all laugh) by not searching(all laugh)..and if possible their soulmates will come and will be told mom and dad is busy bodyslamming(all burst into laughter) does yours do too how many illegal(all burst into laughter) and send you to mole here for more possibilites(all bruts into laughter)...that’s enough to give up pokemon career(all laugh)..so Kommo-O still pains you then don’t get one in this life or else i’ll kill that brat(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “neither they nor you like me(all laugh)...anyway(all burst into laughter)..”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “only i book my hubby(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “that’s why they are vulgarizing her life(all burst into laughter)...fine(all burst into laughter) the above statement says she’s old now so i’m not liking her bookings(all burst into laughter)...’never(all laugh) in a million years’(all burst into laughter)...sweet(all laugh) Mist flower...so(all laugh)...right(all laugh),so Trace gave a recation hearing this like am i inturding privacy in public(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “i thought how can an old couple look young(all burst into laughter) cause before me it was still ok as about life i never had that FEELING(all burst into laughter) of professionality(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “this brat Trace is now dancing to that master brat’s tunes else he never called me anything but Mr(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “and Mr(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “plus he has finally had that feeling on how can he devour the Daisyl(all laugh) unlike previously(all laugh)..plus his family was told how great he is and my family the opposite(all laugh)..this is schism(all laugh)..”
Misty(same pose,smile) : “that feeling(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “of young flower dreaming(all burst into laughter)...anyway(all burst into laughter) about Kommo-O being with me well utmost brat he would’ve become(all laugh)..anyway(all burst into laughter),but i alos didn’t get Ultranercozma then(all laugh) well,Nercozma i tried this is the mega version as you know(all laugh) hence the enhanced pestering(all laugh) well Torkal took 4 months become Torquail..Ultranercozma i went to Ulstock,Unova(all laugh) but that place similarly    had many Ultranercozmas who were too battle hungry(all laugh) and this was 4 months after Garchomp(all laugh) and this was their most dense populated area so i was extremely dissapointed(all laugh) then Kommo-O in penultimate month 2 more months later made me truely sad(all laugh) actually my Ultranercozma was away then(all laugh) and Kommo_O will be next term(all laugh) OR(all laugh)...Magmortgolem(all laugh) Dave says why don’t you spoil mine(all laugh) i said no your bunch won’t be spoiled so easily if not at all for that matter too ingrained in battle(all laugh) says but you were as crazy if not more not less for sure(all laugh) i said cause i couldn’t anticipate you can do anything it’s your blood mine was tranplanting(all laugh) said yeah Kommo-O rightly said life is hard(all laugh)...then i continued Unova is no good for this gym leader and Kalos as i said the culture would influence her badly even if from there itself and the variety of pokemons as well so yeah that’s for her gym leader life and skills but everywhere else just as good..here is why i am forcing Persy Kalos to preach my sweet Mist flower’s name and telling Mist to become more jovial(all laugh) then Kalos is tamed(all laugh) and for Unova well(all laugh) each dragon will say the homeland is full of substandard beaus(all laugh) cause the illegality is not allowed easily for parents by this to this age children(all burst into laughter) too idiotically demanding(all burst into laughter) and so on no my bunch is most vulgar(all laugh) but that makes them even more sweet cause thay themselves can’t breed at all(all laugh) all cause of how to get under the skin so that mind games are sharper(all laugh) but making Mist jovial is impossible(all laugh) sees me or the ring and that’s it(all laugh)...anyway(all laugh),no you know i never criticized her before cause i was staying so far away from her i felt bad if she was hurt cause all i care about her skiils is that cute frown(all laugh) from my current position if i look back at myself at Johto Mist was better than me abolutely if she was a trainer and actually in Orange i was invincible really(all laugh) then my standard dropped cause that was sudden and i kinda lost that touch after first year at Johto i realized that it was about more practise and all but i understood it will take this league for sure and then if i think then first year at Hoenn her progress was more than me and that sudden thing surprized me cause i felt it was forced upon her cause she was better with that Gyarados may be but i felt like she won’t progress anymore as if that was it and i knew i will so i was curious about her and she was doing alright and it was more about her personality change that surprized me and then by Hoenn finals she could only have a 65-35 chance in group knockouts against me that too only if we were husband and wife(all laugh) else no chance and the reason wasn’t me but Tyranitar,Muk,Snorlax,Solgaleo,Sableye,Marshadow,Beeheeyem and all rest with Craudaunt and Glalie(all laugh) and still the rest(all laugh) and she has reached that potentital and hasn’t changed much i’ve gone way beyond imagination cause of TYRAniTAR(all laugh) and cause of my bunch and now you know about Magmortgolem and our 3 brats here(all laugh) that is a level atleast some of anyone’s bunch can reach atleast two will not one cause that bonhomie(all laugh) so then after Hoenn my Mist was all about the scowls(all laugh) and i just was beside her and all in terms of skills and no when i’m with her i don’t want that professional life to come anywhere near us cause it disturbs me to become Kommo-O(all laugh) and you know her(all laugh)..right(all burst into laughter),and Kommo-O against Mist if she is in opposition now means i will myself scoff my bunch off cause i can’t stay like that with her in serious cases(all laugh) i could only manage once cause she was not my wife then officialy and the next day was spent with the picture which that day itself i bought and Lance said why the money i said please McShin isn’t ever funny(all laugh)..McShin now says like please mate let that off(all laugh) i say Stu you’re not helping yourself are you(all laugh) and then again forgets next moment like Jasu(all laugh)..mom never saw that picture cause it was in ghostly room(all laugh) and while i got in mom was kept busy by Mime and i just kept gazing at the picture and was saying Mist i’ll be excruciatingly cruel on you on the date but you’re not going anyweher not being called Mist Ketchum(all laugh)..and no really i was happy till the previous day night but then Gary called and said Misty has agreed to meet you but just as a personal advise you may know her psychophysical condition so don’t be too cruel just this no matter your intentions and i then wished him off(all laugh) but that was multiple edged cause first it meant my Mist may leave me this term before i finish my talks second again the insinuation that i don’t care about as much as her family does(all laugh) then thirdly and most brutally Gary of all people has become too infatuated no matter how delicate condition Lillie might be in still he should be able to manage his wife(all laugh) then this made me first to get Trace out of there and then create false alarms and then Muk tried his best to get Professor out and i actually that day was blind totally at that moment and thought fair enough two generations will be shown the door(all laugh) and then Daisy being alone without the jackal meant jackal won’t try to fight me(all laugh) and then suddenly all sorts of ideas came to me and i went prepared and knew the professor so told Sableye to hold you up in that position as much(all laugh) and leave Mr Oak Mr Oak cause he may catch you but Professor surely could in the lower levels but won’t say anything(all laugh) and he did of course cause had it been higher that day given my agitation you would've been hospitalized for a month may be(all laugh) and Gary tried to hit me after like 22 years(all laugh) got Gengared(all laugh) then i came out thinking this was good cause my Mist will be even more desperate and agitated to get the words lesser(all laugh) and then Mist came up didn’t know else that would’ve been the first topic(all laugh) but she fed me the words womanising playboy(all laugh) i said yeah change the genders to complete the circle(all laugh) then was scowling and was so sweet(all laugh) then that was almost it then and then finally married her but return and never expected mom to be there(all laugh) then before that Mist was saying that my sisters suffered due to me as much and then i realized what i did but i thought just leave it i’ll get the husbands trapped(all laugh) and no Brock was lulled into naivety(all laugh) and the jackal still called me getting my number from Daisy via Lillie via Gary(all laugh) then i was still jovial after telling Mist of my adventures(all laugh) but then Daisy said don’t you still agree that you should’ve returned from Unova still even today(all laugh) then i realized what pain she was going through and Lillie as well in full cause i hurt to moms who were in deepest connection with their unborn babies and me being their bro-in-law were doing these(all laugh) so then i tell the crook that atleast i like Mist(all laugh) then i start the beautiful hell(all laugh) which made sure that the end will send Daisy to the dayside for the rest of this term(all laugh) next time Daisy will play the gentle version while the jackal sentimentally chides all(all laugh) getting Scyther evolved(all laugh) and then that was done then my flower did the rest and Violet called later trying to eat me up(all laugh) so i patted my sensei on Mantine to Mantine(all laugh) and Violet being Violet took 6 minutes to say naivety is viral(all laugh) so that was done crook of all people was saying who the hell o you think you’ve become and i was thinking man if i tell Chu to kill you he will inform you the first then attack me the second(all laugh) only if you have a gun or something and my bunch is there that can happen(all laugh) but the trouble is i won’t try to understand if that’s a real one or not unless i’m as much screwed up(all laugh) so Brock was told that Kingler is here longest and she will kill herself rather than to do anything to any of you cause she knows who you are individually as well now and i’m the brat(all laugh) so Gary and Trace were said the same thing before and as usual whole family realized that it’s reunion grandest time but the jackal tried to fox around(all laugh) didn’t turn out well of course(all laugh) anyway,so no matter Mist’s level if my bunch doesn’t mingle with me i’ve ever the lesser in professional life(smiles at Misty,Misty smiles at Ash too both same pose all else laugh) but my brats don’t like it(all laugh) and sadly her brats a few doesn’t either(all laugh) but the thing is that Mist if she wants can be as good as me and jovial like this and all and since Hoenn her progress has been hindered cause my Ash proposed his my Mist(all laugh)...fine(all laugh),so she could tame Tlplocus and all but if Xormnuh comes and asks her questions(all laugh) then she can tame it and will with her attitude as to me and not me like we're same when both of us don’t want to battle we play but here i don’t at all yet you want to battle thus only hurting yourself none else and understand that me and you are same thus we’re same but i want to fondle my bunch or you like me which is great but this will not continue for long and after sometimes she is bored and then her answer is yeah this and that but my Ash likes me(all laugh) so she didn’t progress cause cause now she is at a way higer level in battling except Unova(all laugh) and Unova is not cause it’s my Unova(all laugh) so yeah all my judgements i say are opinions of Kommo-O(all laugh) else Mist is 7 league,6-1 absolutely any one league i take off cause my Ash married me but he is in another region so mentally i will be there as well(all laugh) if we were doing contests we were absolutely May and Drew but here the draws are not liked(all laugh) but i could never play those mind games with my sweet flower more than once and if i did and won i would’ve married her immediately(all laugh) and all next league i’ll submit but i have sadly a brat named Feraligator(all laugh) but he would’ve been her buddy making sure she gets nuts so that i can fondle her even more(all laugh) but i criticize her cause she is playing old wife stuff(all laugh) thus making her bunch jovial is my burden now and thus 3 damn brats has come up(all laugh) so Mist is ever like this and me and my bunch is same to her so her bunch has got an excuse to mingle with me(all laugh) and still Mist serves everyone with her knowledge of dragons like Garchomp,Palkia,Noivern,Kyurem,Giratina,Ultranercozma,Latios,Hydreigon and so on(all laugh) all has been here but these brats more especially Garchomp cause he was alone(all laugh) and hence beaked everyone off with reflection mastery(all laugh) but Mist is so happy now why so Misty flower(all laugh,all laugh)..”
Misty(same pose,smile) : “cause my Ash is totally under my command(all laugh) that is i can bodyslam him as much as i want as Mist not Misty(all laugh)..”
Ash(same pose,laugh) : “so she is too sweetened now to understand that she is a gym leader(all laugh)...so(all laugh),doesn’t want to and thus just goes and comes around always with pokemons and now she is if she wants so can be absolutely my equal cause she knows me and my methods inside out that skill of battling is her own accumulated knowledge but the soul is with my Ash so the things my Ash knows is the real knowledge thus the two mixed will get her to handle my bunch as well as me  and she knows them as well but the problem is my Ash means only my Ash so any thought after that stops(all laugh) my Ash actually has harmed her career progress(all laugh)...so(all laugh),she can beat any dragon or go there and tame a dragon but that is not Kommo-O agreed(all laugh) and hence i say she hasn’t progressed cause if both our bunchs were same we would’ve created a monopoly in the pokemon world(all laugh) and if she was a trainer it would’ve happened(all laugh) and you know her actual level is as good as Dave atleast as he says after each match(all laugh) Dave says really bro your judgement on all is too harsh i say Dave Kommo-O told me life is hard(all laugh) no really when i was normal(all laugh) i was just like anyone nothing special may be 2 time champ or max 3 no more but since Corpish and Snorant became Crawdaunt and Glalie(all laugh) Glalie was a bit shaky for a long time which she got out of only after being at the gym relaxed too much(all laugh) and if Golduck gets that he will get totally spoiled like Magmortgolem thus he doesn’t(all laugh) and infact himself in a way just loves Mist as this form more than the jovial form(all laugh) which of course is against Kyogre dictionary(all laugh) Gyarados understands Golduck’s concerns more cause her beau likes him too much(all laugh) and Jellicent was most ardent follower of none other than Gengleye(all laugh) so can’t think(all laugh) Kyogre atleast can think(all laugh) as he sadly had Noivern(all burst into laughter) and then had Greninja(all laugh) so the lecturing hasn’t manifested outwardly thus too cunning(all laugh) but Glalie if in mood was a damn brat(all laugh) and Crawdaunt was Crawdaunt so then i realized these brats means more so understood now i atleast have Muk,Charizard,Solgaleo,Tyranitar,Marshadow,Sableye,Snorlax,Metagross,Buzzwole,Emboar,Sharpedo,Meowstic,Whimsicott and these two all very special thus 15 and i need 10(all laugh) so then it was upto me but then came out that Bayleaf,Torquail,Heracross,Typhlosion,Floatzel,Kingler,Sceptile himself(all laugh) and so on were damn brats as well(all laugh) but these doesn’t include Feraligator cause he was choosy if he didn’t like it on the day or the challenger he won’t bother(all laugh) that is an in-born brat(all laugh) and Crawdaunt was incessant as that dark type was but he was nasty and tried to disobey all time and lull challengers to follow him(al laugh) his thing was he must use his distributed brain to recombine all combinations in permutations(all laugh) and Snorlax was if he gets his way only then that is he will fool around only(all laugh) and Muk is better not discussed(all laugh) and so on each had their own moods(all laugh) but my Mist flower had such pokemons but she might become jovial as well but different nature means different behaviour so not like mine but exactly like Kyogre,Jellicent and Gyarados now the art of challenger lulling(all laugh) but my Mist flower doesn’t like it cause she will play big sister and say life is such and all then as the official hours finish will eat her my Ash up(all laugh) so Mist revolts against progressing to joviality(all laugh)...right(all laugh),and she knows everything about everything i do now(all laugh) but still if i say why don’t you do more anatomy(all laugh),’21 years too much hum(all laugh)’ my sweet Mist flower during marriage said you too cheated upon me,’shut up you’re only my Ash(all laugh)’,then i said i have cheated now back cause that didn’t go well,’stop you namecall only mine you are(all laugh)’,then i finally said you rejected me to cheat upon me(all laugh),’Ash why don’t you like me(all laugh)’,i realized that she is totally blind and thus never knew where she was since 16(all laugh) if not 6(all laugh) then Daisy told me that night she is too devoted ever don’t hurt her she will follow your finger movements i was thinking yeah like the jackal(all laugh) atleast you are allowing the jackal or the crook or Gary to be firm with you for 30 seconds(all laugh) but my flower will catch cold if i call her Misty even once in a serious conversation by mistake(all laugh) today itself i for once said yeah Misty(all laugh)..right(all laugh),she won’t say anything then but after it has finished will say,’right but all is ok cause i’m Misty(all laugh)’ then it means i called her Misty...right(all laugh),so i have to fondle my Mist flower again...so(all laugh),she has to boss me around like that that whatever she does i will like her(all laugh) and then if she is scolded for doing too much to be in attention(all laugh) she will catch cold cause my Ash doesn’t like me(all laugh) then whole time i must be there and that is Mist flower’s motto of life my Ash should like me(all laugh) and my method of making a firm statement is to sweeten her up too much(all laugh) so herself realizes that yeah my Ash likes me so lets see if he is right or not then if not right she will say beause she is old now i don’t cherish her as much(all laugh) then i myself have to find out her reason of disagreement and then sort it out while she will be at negetive circles(all laugh) toffee-flower(all laugh)...anyway(all laugh),then i continued that,so that is there as full of her career assesment and for your parts it was from 3rd Hoenn,Sinnoh,Orange or Orange,Hoenn,Sinnoh or Orange,Sinnoh,Hoenn(all laugh) then if first then Sinnoh and Orange and second Orange or Hoenn and Sinnoh and 3rd Orange or Sinnoh and Hoenn(all laugh) so yeah the 3rd league is definitely and one before that too but Kalos was the wrong K should’ve been Kanto(all laugh) but if Kalos was tried in the illusion as Kanto was then again might’ve had a good progess atleast Salamences would’nt have been this dangerous but Darkrai,Heatran,Malamar,Zeraora,etc could’ve(all laugh) and you still would’ve won Kanto in your current histories if Kanto was tried in place of Kalos as Johto,Kanto Frontier,Sinnoh and Hoenn was done Kanto should’ve been infact tried to proceed further in illusion against me(all laugh) cause that would’ve been won as that last part which did get that would’ve fuelled this cause i never won Kanto(all laugh) and my Sinnoh trophy would’ve been negated(all laugh) with Hoenn already been there and Orange would’ve been won after that so by the end of that and when i was being promiscus(all burst into laughter) would’ve made sure i’m only Frontier up(all laugh)..as i say this i saw that men were totally baffled(all laugh) that i was planning like them(all laugh) so i continued the honestly dishonest hallucinations of VEILING my relations with my flower(all laugh)..so yeah that would’ve only made the illusion stronger though(all laugh)...and then her skills are perfect to fetch Kanto exactly lacking what i never got it then and yeah Cobalion would’ve come too(all laugh) but again if Kalos was last in place of Kanto then i’m very sorry but no matter the fuel upto max and no matter how good the bunches are and yeah max even upto last 16 may be and no with much much less fear but title no chance with Heatran,Zeraora,Darkrai,Malamar,Salamence but also innumerable in numbers there at border are Zygarde(all burst into laughter) hence you can’t get any cause you can see one which is a bunch and the viseversa mentally thought(all burst into laughter),and those places are where many gyms are as well that are must for 2+(all burst into laughter) and the order is Cobalion,Xerenes,Heatran,Zygarde(all laugh) and the reason why Kalos is afraid of Unova is Zygarde(all laugh) cause Zygarde life dictates that if anyone is around me he is here to give me a feeling that i must protest even if dead(all burst into laughter) so to tame them you must make them understand you will help them in protesting cause you yourself protest against your own bunch being around you and the viseversa(all burst into laughter) so you go there and let your bunch infight to confuse them(all laugh) then when they come in you join in infighting againt your own Cobalion(all burst into laughter) he can’t hit you so will go to psychic level where you tell him you don’t like him(all burst into laughter) then he will be sad thus Zygarde will be interested in you(all laugh) then will surround you alone(all laugh) one will come to you to ask for your health(all laugh) you tell them health itself is a hazard as an idea cause when we’re sick we think about it when healthy then too so just the constant idea isn’t it(all burst into laughter) why so much infatuation(all burst into laughter) thus Zygarde will realize you’re a wise Zygarde so will try to make you wiser(all burst into laughter) thus will come to you but before that your Cobalion must engage with you again and again and so on(all burst into laughter)..they said,yeah our Cobalion is great but it’s not a Gengar(all burst into laughter) i said yeah that idea(all burst into laughter) and then i said,because of all these dragons and your disliking of dragons cause of the taste of life is different to you than that of dragon it’s the ideological difference of expression of happiness that is(all burst into laughter) thus for Unova i’m sorry but agian too tough a place though could’ve been toured very well with a few Dragonites and Garchomps(all laugh) and certainly a Noivern too(all burst into laughter) if you didn’t already have one from Kalos(all burst into laughter) so overall you see may be the 4th if not illusion but hard so 3 leagues are amusing by all means if not 4 though i realize that 2 league is one category 3 is another then 4 and 5 is another then the either hall of fame or not that part are another two so yeah in that sclae 2nd level out of 5 not bad at all cause first it’s not the first level of 2 league champ(all laugh) and then that’s just career after that we live for atleast say 40 more years minimum which is lived out in great comfort if just have completed 6 regions getting out of the group knockouts to advanced knockouts 4 times among them(all laugh) so what to speak of 3 time champs and yeah 4 and 5 is better but in terms of money only and the next two are rather depressive at times for many cause of the hazards and especially the topmost one while the next best has that insatiation again(all laugh) but 5 time champs as well have that feeling of one more and you yourselves have bestowed that inevitability on one(all burst into laughter) so you realize it can be hard unless properly understood so yeah just the 4 time all wants and 3 is next best so perfect life don’t you agree(all laugh) said,yeah well financially absolutely true more comfortable is 4(all laugh) but so is 3 than 2(all laugh) just than unhappiness chain that is(all burst into laughter) and the soulmates are 1 time grand conference that too Orange(all laugh) so the gross is most excellent(all laugh) i said,well marriage confirmed then said,yeah at once confessed the whole thing cause of our age(all burst into laughter) i said yeah very nice best wishes then and the future said,well for the future we’re recoreding this full talk(all burst into laughter) as we said we would(all burst into laughter) i said,yeah i understood that and that’s why the consent but i hope that the previous generation doesn’t foist the Gengar to the next(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) said,no just for the important Salamence and Palkia and Zygarde too(all laugh) and the combinational parts the rest will be not noted down and deleted(all burst into laughter) i said well all of them has recorded their share too(all burst into laughter) said yeah as they should be cause other people and all has great views but those are serious and mechanical for an enjoyable experience(all burst into laughter) i said,well i’m ever honoured for the fact that because my bunch can’t communicate in our language..we know hopefully(all burst into laughter)..so i get to give their views including mine to the world cause we like this world that we’re part of as it’s funny in a very enjoyable way(all laugh and .) hence our endeavours to pay homage(all laugh) said yeah we understand that but what about your own assesment i said well about my own situation she helped me in Johto the most i would’ve been out in round 32 itself unless she was present there and during Johto was much better than me and if went to Hoenn and so on i already said but without her it would’ve been if the same route was followed then the same result except a hard awakening in Johto cause i was overconfident in finals which she removed there(all laugh)...by shifting that overconfidence towards her that AH!OH MISTY!MY MISTY!(all burst into laughter,.)...anyway(all burst into laughter,.),no really Daisy poured watercold on my plans of getting her propose me behind closed doors at my own room while doors would’ve been closed by my mom herself or even dad(all burst into lughtaer)...”
Daisy(laugh) : “thus the revenge now(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “to make you happy(all burst into laughter),countering(all laugh)...anyway(all burst into laughter),no really the door would’ve been closed anyway cause i would’ve told mom that i’m waiting for her confess for a change(all laugh) and thus she herself would’ve made the arrangements isn’t that nice(all burst into laughter) or if dad same thing cause i already was a champ atleast not infatuation(all laugh) know both my dad and dad-in-law would’ve done the same to both of us but my gym leader mom would’ve been suspicious(all laugh) till she heard two words(all burst into laughter) it would’ve been something else really but Daisy wouldn’t have had her ways so easily out of gym battling abruptly(all laugh) but still my dream was really to say mom please don’t disturb me my Mist will propose me officially to get married(all laugh) losing the self being Ash in the Mist(all laugh,Ash and Misty smiles at each other than same pose both)/looking to Gary through wigs to get the Lil in gist(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs and in tears laughing,Gary laughs shaking his head)/rocking as Brock to elude the Viol flower then the fist(all uncontrollbaly laugh,Violet in fits of laughter and tears laughing,Brock shakes his head laughing)/finally realizing Tracey means fight to hold the Dase by wrist(all uncontrollbaly laugh,Tracey shakes in head laughing,Daisy in fits of laughter and tears laughing)...the art of planting the grass(all uncontrollably laugh,tears)...anyway(all burst into laughter),so how’s the other reviews(all burst into laughter)..”
Violet(laugh) : “you are going to be my partner in script writing and doing the show all yourself with a few imported and chosen Kommo-O (all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “this brat after 19/20 years is in full retirement to pester the whole world now as revenge(all laugh) and he gets the leeway cause his flower is absolutely Gyaradosey to absolute beyond(all laugh)”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “take that you namecalls he only praised me(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “cause he namecalled you the most before(all laugh)...man this is something really(all laugh)...”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “to namecall you again if you don’t like me(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “as my former Ms Misty Waterflower(all burst into laughter)..right(all laugh),Mist flowerchum(all laugh)...so(all laugh),what are the soulmates saying”
Gary(laugh) : “two words(all burst into laughter)..”
Brock(laugh) : “atleast the jackal got the benefit of licking his boots(all laugh) and Mr Oak Mr Oak for meeting each of his deamands(all laugh) but first this brat dragged me through the world for 11 years taking me AWAY from my flower(all laugh) and then himself namecalled me then humilated my moments in front of family(all laugh)..i’ll dose your brats off(all laugh)..”
Tracey(all laugh) : “still the jackal was fox enough on both occasions to not be present PHYSICALLY(all burst into laughter)”
Ash(laugh) : “BANETTE(all burst into laughter) ayway,then i continued that yeah except Johto rest same but with the possibility that my bunch again would’ve turned on like they are now right after Hoenn(all laugh) or atmost Frontier wouldn’t have waited till Sinnoh(all laugh) and at worst Johto itself making the situation impossibly more jovial cause then i was 20(all burst into laughter) but she would’ve won against me only if she faced me at the group knockouts with 65-35 in my favour(all laugh) after that none could(all laugh) and if she was a stranger or both didn’t have the mutual feeling that we had while we were in our relationship then absolutely no chance(all laugh) first 4 rounds if i was assured that i wanted to marry her right after the match and then immediately settle down have a family then she would’ve won(all laugh) with 65-35 chance in my favour(all laugh) but even then i could’ve atmost married her and bought a house or or something but by then my bunch would’ve turned on me(all laugh) so next two leagues anyway thus i would’ve been a three time champ for sure(all laugh) but you realize with that bunch one title is enough to get to the same place that i’m at now(all laugh) then men became compassionate(all laugh) said,yeah we guess so but you really have been very hurt being away from her so long(all burst into laughter) but we’re just curious as to say we saw her as much hurt(all laugh) and this during your break-up(all laugh) so yeah the middle years were hard(all laugh) but did you two never contacted even just after your undercover(all laugh) cause we know she was asked once and said Crawdauntogator was so sweet(all laugh) and said they still like me(all burst into laughter) so thinking i said,no i did once before undercover(all laugh) was gym battling and that was it said,we see 4 years were rueing that mistake of being gym leader(all laugh) and we know about the Johto parting would’ve never left you would she(all laugh),i said,no i don’t think so untill she was married to me no(all laugh) but that’s not what it is so why don’t i continue the assesment(all laugh),said yeah sure just the idea she is a very strange creature cause all it needed was to tell us that she was forcefully living life of a self inflicted widowhood chiding the husband away(all laugh) forgot the word only(all laugh) so yeah lets continue...i thought yeah like all of us were(all laugh) the Daisyl is a master at this(all burst into laughter,Daisy laughs shaking her head) the jackal understands three words about relationship second cousin,spouse,widow(all laugh) so he reciprocated by the days most(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs,Tracey shakes his head laughing) the crook was playing that much to Violet’s dismay cause she thought that’s not properly played by men that too who forgets not to call at tea(all laugh) and then Mr Oak Mr Oak and Lillie were choosing the right colour of the wig while they forgot they were at reservation(all burst into laughter) and i thought 3 weeks for marriage registration wasn’t enough so later made it in 7 days(all laugh)..anyway(all burst into laughter),no really that word i’ll ever remember Kommo-O said life is hard(all laugh) anyway then i said,well she wasn’t married so that word didn’t occur to her like that thus the trouble(all laugh) so anyway then and if i was a gym leader at Cerulian(all burst into laughter) say the youngest brother than the youngest sister then i would’ve wanted to go to Unova once in the middle(all laugh) then only return again no matter what the great leads said(all laugh) cause Daisy Waterflower was as good as the current one is once and the span was little cause her ambitions and all wasn’t like that she had many talents so just one would’nt appease great talents the current one has got the starship brand(all laugh)..fine(all burst into laughter),got that starship brand due to the work done by all the 3 elder sisters and the gym leading part only is her own but yeah Daisy helped her in initial days VIA the gentleman(all burst into laughter) who is a brilliant observer(all burst into laughter,Tracey laughs shaking his head,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs) thus the pokemons were looked after very well and that steady calm getleness(all laugh) made the current leader responsible enough cause we all know the previous version(all laugh)...right(all burst into laughter),so thus is the reality there but she she went in shows i would’ve fled to Unova(all laugh) for 2 years cause Daisy at that moment should’ve been forced to battle more(all laugh) thus after Unova i’d got a few Palkia and Kyurem and the hall of fame process would’ve been there in this year only rather than the last cause my philosophy in gym battling is to let everyone have their ways thus being too cunning(all laugh) so the outside doesn’t pester and the right ones come to have a good day like this(all burst into laughter) but yeah even there my bunch could’ve got spoiled(all laugh) far earlier(All laugh) then the gym would’ve been rather a joviality conference(all laugh) with even fire types and all(all laugh) that would mean that the gym is a hoilday destination for many like Orange in a nutshell giving a humungus sum to feast upon(all burst into laughter,.) the badge is obviously Responsibility badge(all burst into laughter) for first quarter of a year(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tear) where my bunch would responsibly show how not to be so(all burst into laughter) cause that’s only volunteering to jump into fire involving the psychophysical ideas rather than pure heartfelt ones without them always as they are(all laugh),second quarter is Competence Badge to show the only way to be competent is to not be so(all burst into laughter) cause as a little deep thinking tells us that there’s no such thing as present(all laugh),thus one shouldn’t think past or future(all burst into laughter) cause the past has got them upto the present which is now past and the next moment now was the future from the 2nd previous moment(all burst into laughter) and thus the only way to way is to not be bother about time but the the mental and philosophical progress observed day by day(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs in tears,Tracey uncontrollbaly laughs as well) which is self introspection thus where is the second to compete with(all burst into laughter,.) this was one then 3rd quarter is Rationality Badge(all burst into laughter) as my bunch will show that if you are different from your master cause your master wants to battle you don’t(all laugh) as that word isn’t meaningful to them so thus be rational leave thy master cause he’s a pain unto your sanity(all burst into laughter) see we want to play and our master allows that so come to us and they would’ve followed suit later fondling their own masters this is the rationality that the trainer and his bunch is different from each other thus the trust is mutual ever one shouldn’t foist there ideas upon another and pokemons can’t do that thus the responsibility is the trainer’s to be rational on himself thus all follows(all burst into laughter .) to call at lunch(all laugh) then the 4th quarter is the Professionality Badge(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) where my bunch will show that be professional by being not serious(all burst into laughter) why think about the goal or the actions the steps to go there cause they will not be never be enough to satisfy the feeling of hunger so focus on that professionally and find out that that hunger can be satisfied only if it is known that to live one doesn’t need anything except food and safe shelter thus if that’s the need the rest is all a polish to get that so why not we remove the polish and do only that that is the life of say a pokemon that can’t breed eat sleep wake-up repeat(all burst into laughter) but then once this is understood it will be seen that being humans we can’t do that thus we need something more as a food-social food,intellectual food,emotional food,spiritual food,philosophical food,experiential food,congnitive food and so on(all laugh) which being so many can only be satisfied by that one dish which will have all this included in abundance and where this can be found is to be reflected upon(all laugh) now in the world things vary thus that food will not be possible to get but in the mind where this hunger is generated like in body where gross food and so on is generated is telling us to search for food outside yet in each moment the same mind is telling us that that all encompassing dish(all laugh,Brock laughs .ly) is not available outside at all cause no matter what this hunger for that food will ever inrease if i never lost a match i would want each to finish in one minute(all laugh) and so on thus it will be shown that being born is a curse cause one is agitated with psychophysical ideas like say Ultranercozma 5 type advantage why not all in one(all burst into laughter) then if all at what proportion(all laugh) if all how does it feel not not have even one(all burst into laughter) and so on thus the only way to be happy(All laugh) is to try to be happy by trying to be so(all burst into laughter) the same self introspection should be continued with the idea that whatever is enticing at this moment try to do that honestly and with focus and be prefect in that as much as possible thus each moment the joy that is generated of a perfect that is local and not that global elusive one is enough to give that total dish(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) so the whole life becomes ethically honest in due morality of honesty inbibed in ethics(all laugh) and that is happy life which is found inside one rather than outside of one thus to be professional the way is to rather than being an individual who is personally professional to the world be the world in whole and then be professionally personal to get that individual that you are from that world(all laugh and .) counter the natural way of thinking thus an alternative is found and thus the alternative to that being the natural way is more sharpened thus one would know the idea of peronally professional and professionaly personal(all burst into laughter and .) if mixed together all is negated each feeling giving the joy of a little baby that doesn’t know anything but this time the joy is after knowing everything thus where is seriousness and professionality of personality(all laugh and .) only an honest individual remains who is happy by being so(all laugh) this is as you know is learnt from the a great professional that is Mr Oak Mr Oak(all burst into laughter,Gary laughs shaking his head,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs) so he agrees with this and for me that is big cause he ever has agreed with to the beings who are propagating this idea that is my bunch(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) and yeah i did say there too that it is because Mr Oak Mr Oak agrees(all laugh) as of that type(all laugh)..but also please point out the number of edges and direction of propagation and reciprocate Mrs Oak that this is AH!NOT DR OAK BUT MR OAK!(all burst into laughter)..and Mrs Slate please point out the number and types of food that is required at which time and reciprocate please as AH!LUNCH BREAK NOT TEA BREAK!(all uncontrollbaly laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “my lion now with foods and directions will be in serious mess(all laugh)..AH!MAGMORTER!GOLEM!(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “and with foods and timings of breaks(all laugh),it’s all just so naive(all burst into laughter)..”
Brock(laugh) : “this is revenge(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “still atleast you had your time to invoke that feeling i’ve never had that either(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “TYRAniTAR(all laugh)...so anyway,then i say,so is this for an idea men were in another world(all laugh) they say,amusing amusing the perfect way to teach whole life in one match as to it helps in all walks of life and 4 stages are also like eat sleep wake-up repeat(all burst into laughter) eat those foods(all laugh) sleep in self reflection wake-up with new idea or realization repeat the process Gengars are like that(all burst into laughter) eat roam around come back to eat again repeat(all laugh) great great i said,yeah philosophically may be may be even pokemons can demonstrate it to then self analyze the rest but at the end of the day it’s the bottom line(all burst into laughter) cause else neither me not my bunch can continue our job and so this four badges is all cause that’s the contradiction to drive even more tourists in while keepning the most challengers out cause that word is useless(all laugh and .) so a win-win really isn’t it(all laugh and .) said,yeah brilliant plan to Gengar the whole life on top of money(all laugh) and then to use the money everywhere needed cause a Gengar doesn’t need any comfort cause it doesn’t understand what it means(all burst into laughter,.) and yeah we a group from office went to a few matches here in your Elite4 tour(all laugh) and we hear that the black market was hot(all laugh) and we were given comfortable positions due to the position to watch and have fun and that was fun cause none knew why your bunch was so happy(all laugh) and the opposition was wiliting like that despite just plays(all laugh) the sum that was forced by you to be shared with you(all laugh) which later went to multiple places even in Orange some of which we ourselves signed and passed(all burst into laughter) and so on and all were to places where exactly the heads don’t want them to go cause of the ego clashes only(all laugh) so this idea of a Gengar(all laugh) has really struck us that all fears Gengar all loaths Gengar all are irritated by Gengars and yet when sad Gengars are making people happy and then overall a Gengar is too intigruing a creature to mingle with much but yet when chance comes one would be entertained and taught thing both beyond imaginations(all laugh) i said yeah pretty only if a real Gengar is consulted or can be kept patient that long for that matter(all laugh) but about the money well that is what it is cause it’s just someone’s money is going to someone to make the later happier the former the opposite(All laugh) we all know so using the situation i could burgain only(all laugh) but yeah about the gyms making money surely the similar situation with money and we all after 19 years of crwaling around the whole world(all laugh) want peace and happy personal life and that’s all and as we know our situations financially allows that so so happy for that bit but what will the future learn(all burst into laughter) said,just be not serious about things that make you serious like life and death(all laugh and .) rest is about being too happy to be honest and so on then just go about i said yeah that’s everyone would like and i’m happy so much that if my bunch and thus me could help people and so on(all laugh) then they said,yeah we’re so happy for this meeting as well(all laugh) but about the combinations of regions you were giving according to general ideas we guess contests are similar given your experiences there(all laugh) i said yeah pretty much my second female travel companion is now married Mrs May Maple Blackmore you might know about her more given your halving procedures(all laugh) said yeah she is famous rather for drawing 3 straight with her now husband Mr Drew Blackmore and definitely too famous for her style of relentless attacking in 5 minutes(all laugh) and then in last four final rounds in finals 8(all laugh) and her husband being the exact opposite(all laugh) who was ever best pointer i 1st round to her who ever was the last to qualify(all laugh) then the exact opposite in 2nd round where Mr Spew Blackmore(all laugh) ever looked at bay with too much shrewdness and Mrs May Maple Blackmore ever looked too lunatic to not jump upon the whole crowd and judges by jumping her hubby(all laugh) and both would’ve got atleast another conference but they may be had had some serious personal or family issues and thus now setteled down and so on but the whole general trainer’s world knows your shared ribbon with her(all laugh) and the whole conference world knows that her style was directly influence by having to compete with you for 4 years(all laugh) for which she is too happy and wants to beat you so much(all laugh) and her husband ever thoughtfull(all laugh) cause that got him out of his too calculative approach of spewing(all laugh) and he got the draws in finals but the whole conference world knows the duo for their inter spouse skirmishes everywhere(all laugh) which were so funny to all(all laugh) and they so innocently after each time said just emotions(all laugh) i said yeah May and Drew is like that ever too simple and sweet and their bond has been like that for 13 years now(all laugh) and so happy i’m that they are married and all having a good life and professionally so great but i know that you must win 5 out of 7 and in conferences to face their Congress leaders then get them 4 in 7 to get hall of fame there and so on they don’t have the Frontier system but for that reason the specific time is 1 year less(all laugh) we at 16 years within first 6 months atmost till our 40th birth month and they 39th birth month and then you can start only upto 19.75 and never 20(all laugh) and in general you get exactly 24 years and a month from your birth month to travel the whole world getting wild brats to make them listen to you for 6 hours while having their ways with you for the rest 18(all laugh) so that you may make a living after 40 if you're alive after 20 that is(all laugh) so you must finish within 43 and 9th birth month else you're not getting general trainers tag even(all laugh) delicious isn't it these rules and life(all laugh) they said yeah maddening life cause of such sweetening rules and incessant wild damn brats(all laugh) then i said,hence my brats so sweetly and incessantly dance to that maddening tune(all laugh),but in the legendary ranks where do the duo situates cause they suddenly pulled out when they were just 28 having 11 more years left to complete there career,which Shrew is venturing forth from next(all laugh),yeah told me yesterday man this torture for 1.5 years too much(all laugh) i said what does your rose say(all laugh),yeah not allowed to enter home unless gets Unovan Cili(all laugh)..Cili(all laugh)..no he will go to Kalos actually(all laugh) i told him don't do Unova(all laugh) cause in Kalos still gets Haxorus,Tryruntum,Zygarde,Noivern and Salamence(all laugh)..Salamncian philosophy(all laugh)..mega Salamencian food(all laugh)..man that day was really best comedy ever seen(all laugh) he actually wants the 4th to rev up the CV there(all laugh) will get it closed eyes cause said will live here for 4 months before(all laugh,cheers for VOMIT,all burst into laughter) yeah,sweet sweet spew will have a memorable time here as usual as mad vomit cleaner(all laugh) and he said man can't i do both Kalos and Unova(all laugh) then i said well why don't you do Unova and your sweet rose do Kalos,after all my sis should study at Venturiastrog as well to get her daughters educated shouldn't she(all laugh) so yeah why not i'll have to go to Unova atleast once more and total say 6 years so yeah why not Mist hasn't travelled Kalos,Trace has some unfinished businesses left there(all laugh) and Mr Oak Mr Oak never has travelled with me i want my sweet sweet twin with me(all laugh) so he will have to be at Unova of all places of course(all laugh) no actually both May and Drew wanted to do finish their careers but Orange was so bad experience for them had to quit it and now is happy but you know with the sweet dolls now having grown up a bit both their mom and dad is again getting reddened to battle(all laugh),mom won't though ONLY NOW AT PRESENT(all laugh) but dad is too desperate for a change(all laugh) mom was saying,yeah old age this reinvigoration was inevitable(all laugh) i said May,you are of same age(all laugh),WAY YOUNGER THAN 1 HALF DAY(all laugh) i said yeah,just this age(all laugh) no really you all know Unova wants me in every step(all laugh) and Kalos yeah the magazines(all laugh) and my brats are too impatient as well(all laugh),so i will actually do 39 to 45 two regions and then Mist,Trace and Mr Oak Mr Oak will do 4 months as they are too desperate as well especially my sweet Mist flower(all laugh) she will do 8 in two regions(all laugh) as will Trace and Gary against any kind of own wishes(all laugh) then the rest is many has BOOKED me(all laugh) all wants a bit of me(all laugh),so many people will be there and strangely this includes Persy of all people(all laugh) said no man me and Mrak will join you at Huntelin dinner for sure(all laugh) so they will have to be appeased and then then there are many more(all laugh) and Dave yeah that's default ain't it(all laugh) and Cili(all laugh)..Cili(all laugh)..Cili is a must at Huntelion(all laugh)..i'll do Unova from 39 to 41 then Kalos from 42 to 44 till last month and from 45th birth month my cap will be hung for good for this term(all laugh) but no really you know i do have two regions left for me(all laugh) and well it will depend on many things including Lugian revolution most(all laugh) but just wish i could do that once more AH!that maddening tune!(all laugh) Dave says similar stuffs as well you know(all laugh) no bro one more region atleast whoose who'se beau bring each brat together(all laugh),Doctor Slate is the only one that doesn't want to travel even Violet wants to go to Kalos(all laugh) and Lillie both Kalos and Unova and Daisy only UNova of all places(all laugh) you all will be there for 1 month atleast for sure but may be atmost too(all laugh),but we all want to travel once more why the exceptional feeling Doctor Slate(all laugh).."
Brock(laugh) : "man,enough with your insanity for 11 years(all laugh) even your own wife fled after 5(all laugh) which is um..(all burst into laughter)"
Misty(irritated,same pose,Ash laughs a lot same pose) : "far better than sneaking into Viridian WAITING PATIENTLY(all burst into laughter)..um..(all burst into laughter)..SHUT UP!(all laugh)..my sweet Ash is my sweet projection and i'll do whatever i want with my sweetie(all laugh).."
Ash(laugh) : "so sweet my ponytailed Mist Gyarados(all laugh,Ash smiles at Misty who smiles at him in same pose),anyway,then back to beauty(all laugh),so then i said well i know that they only pulled out due to the fact that pests were at them only cause the pests couldn’t draw 3 contest finals but never for not reaching them though(all laugh) as much as i know, said,well we guess just the fact that had any lost the 2nd final his or her chance of hall of fame no more so they drew but then continued the travel companionship means they never cared about names and so on even then the general sentiment is that they are as good as hall of fames and you may know conferences aren’t as obsessive as ours never to recogize anyone as legend who hasn’t got in hall of fame(all laugh) except a very few rare cases who still are forced into honourary hall of fame(all laugh) and under that light surely they are world famous names and household names if legend can’t be used to term them for formalitie’s sake but what about your personal realtions with them(all laugh) i said,well May just was my little sister in the first two of her regions Hoenn and Kanto and in Kanto she took that as 1.5 years the next 2.5 making life even harder for her(all laugh) and all cause wanted to travel one more region with me and the nice things about her style that i saw myself to develop from zero and well she may now say that battling me all time helped but it was rather the big bro little sis skirmishes(all laugh) she developed that style by herself i was just there and we’ve had that bond of brother and sister and truely are so but she now is a grown up lady married and all(all laugh) so that bond is rather free of the little sis big bro emotioanl tug-of-war stuff now and thus more mentally ideological than verbally communicational(all burst into laughter,.) and she is too good at her game as you see and yeah Drew i know as long as May and he is extremely as good as her as you can see as well so yeah say if you go to Hoenn then same if Orange then send them to Kanto definitely nowhere else including Orange absolutely(All laugh) cause both of you MIGHT intrude being too CARING(all burst into laughter,Brock .ly laughs)..anyway they said,well thanks much but it depends on personalities too i said,definitely all general approach but Kanto is most you can say modest culture(all laugh) with Johto almost similar and Hoenn just a little open and Orange,Kalos and Sinnoh you know(all laugh) said yeah Orange and Sinnoh and Salamence nests(all laugh) but may we ask something(All laugh) i said,whether i’ve already married Misty Waterflower or not(all burst into laughter) said,yeah(all laugh) i said no just looking for a match(all burst into laughter) they say,well don’t mind but given your sudden visit here(all laugh) you mean a real match or just the date of the match(all burst into laughter) i said no the real one first then the result will decide what she does(all laugh) said,did you have the suspicion then cause we wanted to give that(all laugh) but yeah not the hometwon our aim was to ask about Pewter and as you might’ve said a few things about that cause Brock wasn’t happy with you at all(all laugh) we thought might be a family WIDE issue(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) cause in general he is so NICE(all burst into laughter)..
Brock(laugh) : “you namecalled brat(all laugh) who was doing the beautiful talkings(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well in the Pewter gym there’s a section where things are POLISHED(all burst into laughter) a too bit(all burst into laughter)..”
Brock(laugh) : “i’ll check on you myself now(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well only if at right time cause our gym leader here is too Gyaradosey now(all laugh)..”
Misty(same pose,smile) : “you’re not allowed in private section(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well first after renovation the private section is totally privated(all laugh) in small sections and all and then even Sarah isn’t allowed now if i’m here inside our circle(all laugh)...right(all burst into laughter) then they continued that our plan was to then may be tell you that some people are hurt and so on so they want to confront you on this(all laugh) then may be you would’ve understood it and we would’ve challenged for the one on one saying atleast for the talks let us see if you always are ready for matches and so on(all laugh) i said well the trouble with illusions is that what is needed to be confronted the exact opposite does get the treatment and thus the persons who delivers fumbles the lines all were needed to be known was whether i was still pestering her by keeping contacts or not that is easily clarified by asking the gentleman(all laugh) then the next is that either it’s infatuation or truth and if infatuation then that degree can’t be cured except for the devil himself(all laugh) the trouble is that the devil wasn’t contacting for 4 years at all and thus the devil wasn’t infatuated so his presence wouldn’t be there at all and then the next step is as you went through then the logic was that that level of infatuation would be categorized as exactly the opposite yet the devil isn’t bothered at all and the devil himself went off after 15 years means may be devil himself was infatuated and saved himself no matter how long thus your own cases apply(all laugh) and that is it the afterlife of the leader is of no interest what-so-ever cause is useless just best wishes no more and then if that from the leader’s part not infatuation but from the devil’s part was and thus he did what he did then it means the only way the devil would’nt have done it if he was as much infatuated that is not being so(all laugh) so again the thing is exactly what you’re doing with the beautiful women then(all laugh) the stuff is both sided without any reason only then vaidated else may still go on but won’t be a happy affair and that which doesn’t have any reason won’t have the suspicions either from both sides and the frankness will be there from day one if not the exact words and all you saw one exactly there take the gentleman for example and Mr Oak(all burst into laughter) then compare that and you’ll get your current position only that the idea will spourt all by itself in both sides and the eventual will be the need(all laugh) so why bother about anything else thus to me if the illusion comes and can’t be taken off then the simple approach is to directly say the reason of my associetion(all laugh) and if the other side is too in illusion then mutual admiration committee is formed(all laugh) which after 2 days won’t be good at all if analyzed and if the other side directly scoffs off then save myself simple if like workplace where it can’t be helped at all(all laugh) then go to universities and all look outside profession more time with my bunch then the light will be there and it won’t be there from the subject of illusion but the illusion as a whole itself cause it’s only self created and thus self destroyed all has it’s time limit no matter how long and so the medicines are ever the bunch and the university classes and so on books and lectures and thus look off from there and reality will loom said,well this is why this meeting is fixed for increasing knowledge(all burst into laughter) then said our approach was to not be bothered at all and the opposite was the same(all laugh) then i said well is it right to say these to a stranger(all laugh) said,well we’ve known about the occasion when you confessed(all burst into laughter) i said,does she drink in these days(all burst into laughter) said well no worse(all laugh) said that that occasion was so nice with such surprize and all after 8 years but then you threw her off(all laugh) i said well i only am happy that she didn’t say the exact occasion(all laugh) said well if oiled she would’ve(all burst into laughter) cause we were among close friends those days and we came to some help on that Frucient stuff and so on and very few people were left around her in those days barring her family i said yeah i understand(all laugh) then men became very serious and scared(all laugh) said about drinks does everything count i said yeah it does count along with the steps as you know and characters too(all laugh) why bother about things that are not real at all why bother,then men almost fell to my feet(all laugh) said,this is new stuff and it broadens the horizon(all laugh) i said yeah it does(laugh,all laugh) but why many of her friends left then around the time said,well after the break-up was strange(all laugh) and by the time the frontier trouble came around was helpless rather not by means of profession or what is to be done but her family wasn’t enough in her mind without your presence there was gone to the bushes(all laugh) i said yeah for her the medicine was to take a few prolonged vacations but in her mind that has to be said by me only(all laugh) as it will be that the pestering was too much in that situation so to tell Lance to give the protection there but the fact that the pestering is too much is also to be told only by me(all laugh), said,yeah pretty true(all laugh) then they said well as we were saying neither we nor the women(all laugh) did anything of any interest and without reason did the relation bloom after we met at the new Cerulian conference and all then we came here and they stayed there for a bit longer time and then we’re here for 6.5 months now it took one month after the Unova thing then 2 more to adjust(all laugh) then 2 more to get things set then Hoenn wasn’t right so this is next best and got the office(all laugh) and they came just 3.5 months back similar stuffs then one month before it was confirmed and then it took so little time beacuse none of us did anything except discussing professional stuffs then all else and so on so yeah this is nice but did you have the suspicion then at Unova,i said well again best wishes for happy march in and through to the future together(all laugh) and about suspicion well no not at all in my mind that issue wasn’t there cause i was at undercover then Kalos and so much with my bunch another change in them and i never bothered cause the break-up was in my mind for her part and i was hurt too much so both we are extremely stubborn so i really erased it off then but yeah your positions and all the stuff and then the name of the city did give me the intuition that it was about that which made me even more angry cause i had no contacts for 4 years with anyone associeted there and i was worlds apart in 4 years as was my bunch and then why would people pester me for living my life not intruding into anyone else and yeah then only did i get get that there might be more people coming thus i was ready most of the time to prey upon any such(all laugh) with the change that it will be my most dangerously nasty ones now(all laugh) the rest is same..you know in that situation the nastiest is Heracross(all burst into laughter) you’re illegal beau is my legal beus 10th illegal beau(all burst into laughter) how much she tickles you how much she sweet talks you how much she fondles you(all burst into laughter) that is enough for all hells(all laugh) or the great Zekrom(all laugh) or um..are you here for some advices on a date(all burst into laughter) all situation brats are there(all laugh) then men say,well we see and thus you’re also looking to give her the same medicine now that she might’ve alerted you by means of Lance after refusing to directly talk with you(all laugh) i said well you can take the situation to be like that(all laugh) said,well as she doesn’t want her name to go down in the official records as loser against you(all laugh) then we guess the break up had to be about why the career went beyond millennia and thus about trophies whichever came since Unova despite the Sinnoh being thrown around(all laugh) so trophies it was after that very Sinnoh Chair(all laugh) and jealousy without being in direct competition and then the 15 years(all laugh) i said,yeah well not trophies or jealousy at all but other things that became associeted with my name and all that just the trust i guess but trophies were just the cherry on the cake(all laugh) said,yeah trust but the position doesn’t fetch a assured ticket to Unova where whole world could get Tyranitar’s whereabouts but yours(all laugh) that too being a gym leader whoose badge you have(all laugh) cause the gym would’ve to be shut down for max 8/9 days cause the bunch is neglected(all laugh) but the same lab itself is being professionally involved where Solgaleo and all were playing their tricks(all laugh)and Glalie too(all laugh) and there it wasn’t possible to get a booking in the visitor’s room to see just Glalie and what she does despite the master’s presence then from there itself the vocal cord don’t work to tell a trusted stuff to get you in call if the concerned number was blocked(all laugh) and ask you professional questions about Glalie regarding her observations(all laugh) that would’ve been easiest but then for us calling you at Unova too was so(all laugh) so that might be the illusion but watching the TV isn’t hard at all(all laugh) so that final would’ve been enough assurence that no sane girl will go anywhere near you at Unova(all laugh) and to get the bunch to the level like that the bunch itself has to be taken care all the time than to give the relaxation hours to random girls(all laugh) cause even then someone may come out of pokeball wanting to battle that very girl(all laugh) and taking care meant studies and talks that of the whole world randomness doesn’t at all provide(all laugh) all trophies and else were just a veil to cover the gym humiliation sentiment(All laugh) that water gyms were humiliated so the bonhomie(all laugh) professional pride to own boyfriend who were that and whoose Glalie and all else were so well known for 15 years(all laugh) and then 15 years doesn’t confirm that the boyfriend too would be not at all happy being away from her(all laugh) i said,well in certain emotional moments people lose themselves and that level of infatuation meant the madness will be of that level as well but you were around the day i broke-up(all burst into laughter) then i didn’t know now i know the faces(all laugh) said,yeah we went there 4 times a week(all laugh) and yeah was actually eager to see you by means of familiarity(all laugh) but didn’t agree strange(all laugh) i said no wasn’t in the mood that by means of her her friends will have a personal talk with me while she had almost decided to break-up and then even if you were there in her mind then wasn’t of the type to throw that in my face or the other way around it only would’ve saved your money and time by all means(all laugh) this insinuation totally flattened everything(all burst into laughter) if step by step drinks didn’t before(all burst into laughter) i realized the men were only saying just was eager to see me cause so much was happening around me and after 2 leagues and Sinnoh themselves then Salamences most(all laugh) mega Salamnece(all laugh) man Salamence has been upgraded to super legendary category by now(all laugh) anyway,but i twisted it to confirm that my views don’t change no matter where i stand(all laugh) this Mist knows as well(all laugh) the trouble was that it was told during the proper date at Safforn itself(all burst into laughter) actually i know a few people like Persy himself who have married their travel compnaions but most said no man date is mandatory(all laugh) i said but we were together for 24/7 for 5 years why expend unnecessarily(all laugh) SHUT UP!(all laugh),it's an art,respect it(all burst into laughter) sweet sweet Kane darling(all laugh),Kane darling's medicine is DATE(all burst into laughter) no Irene is so very polite and nice girl you know only uses once a month(all laugh) or during skirmishes once a year(all laugh) hence yet to be used(all laugh) monthly schedule is independent of this of course(all laugh),Tony boy gets the opposing way to trap psycho(all laugh),no Olivia is so sweet girl ever can be trapped(all laugh) with i FEEL it psycho(all laugh) ever gets mad with variations or words and additions and moments with this sort of tune(all laugh),but then there's Braumy manual(all laugh),his medicine is with innumerable tonal variations- 
Braum,Braum,Braum(all burst into laughter),yeah not own bunch BUT TAUGHT THIS TO HER MANUALLY(all laugh) but nothing can be compared to VIRIZ,VIRIZ,VIRIZ(all burst into laughter) man this Brenda says is such good medicine that the brat ever begs mercy(all laugh) no Harris son and Kane Darling are absolutely miffed with me given in childhood it was ever the other way around(all laugh) thus this ELOQUENCE(all laugh) anyway,then about that i said,but she and as all in my family and beyond would get cause those are just possibilites given certain possibilites and phases of approximation towards soulmates across lives or times(all laugh) so this made men realize that i really am a Gengar(all burst into laughter) and you know this is from my bunch that it’s not that there’s no more(all laugh) and the brats invisible were asking me why am i not letting them to tickle the men(all laugh) now that i wasn’t serious at all(all laugh) then they opined that Gengar said i was waiting for the men to bodyslam me(all burst into laughter) and Sableye remarked thus table in-between is kept to keep the men waiting(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter) then they said but should’nt you tickle first to rouse the longing(all burst into laughter) i just told the brats to tickle each other which they happily obliged to(all laugh) then scoffed at them saying they don’t like me(all laugh) to which they said this is a plan to show us that i know more about tickling than them(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter) what a bunch that is(all laugh) eat only-sleep wake-up repeat(all laugh and .) so men were too happy cause men were afraid(all burst into laughter) and my rage against possiblities were there only because Lance said no still unmarried according to my knowledge and the situation was bad as i heard else that picture would’ve been brought with a humungous sum(all laugh) and in front of Lance would’ve been destroyed too heavy(All laugh) the sum went to get the current picture for the oficialities and the gym and all(all laugh) and then only when i knew that that’s not the case i was incensed on the whole world(all laugh) and her possible husband as well for not being able to handle her(all laugh) but my thing was that why i was so sad seeing those stuufs in Mist’s room cause the reality is that no matter what i even after the picture had my bunch and you know their views(all laugh) Mist was absolutle alone her own bunch would’ve killed her if she pushed them that much cause they would’ve become mad certainly Goldy would’ve and Jellicent too but i would’ve been more than fine in Kalos reading and all for one year or two then just go to Kukui lab and get to become Gengar and that was just one and half so 3 and half would’ve been at absolute maximum and if Unova then wouldn’t have returned from Unova at all cause once i send Bulbasaur and Muk away knew that was it a whole region wide huntdown begins and if then had a little bit of emotional vulnerability left in the last days there i was here only cause the ring reminded me to atleast try to be here while you can and nothing else cause i had to be in the psychic sphere that i love so much but as again with Mist this is what i thought i thought only(all laugh),you know Zara and the things she arranged(all laugh),the thing for me was that i realized Mist and me are just same hence we are happy only when together and then she wasn't happy at all that i came to know hence surely she wasn't happy with any brats either thus the divorce was so easy(all laugh) and then just knew i was her medicine and yeah it wouldn't have been nice but no would've just been a talk with the hubby actually she wouldn't have ever known(all laugh) any such hubby brats need a day in the life of a choised Zygarde(all laugh) but a real mad hubby brat is a bit concerning(all laugh) which is what i told Drew in such a dramatic manner 10 years back from then much to his utmost suffering(all laugh),hence such brats would've been foisted down with the ultimate that's just ELOQUENCE(all laugh) none passes that one cause many chosen steps only i know along with similar people(all laugh) like shrew(all laugh) and yeah hellrounds hubby brats had to pass hence would've failed cause only i was going to pass hence knew full well when and how they will fail(all laugh) the very basic test that i just say cause still Unova may return just tomorrow as i say or even Lugias may REVOLT(all laugh) thus,another step is which is so hard is that if one is blood and sweat why are they polluting the other(all burst into laughter) if not why she is in such a bother(all laugh) thus she is just that hence it's just another(all laugh) if not then innumerablity evidently shows if one then why not the other(all laugh) this is just the beginning hence no madcap will survive(all laugh) and most brutally as Spew was forced with these rounds don't end at all(all laugh) either you yourself understand the soul as much as you can or just bust(all laugh) and surely no brats would've been told by word of mouth they had to be present with Giracozma for as long as like 20 hours constant(all laugh) yeah you know them the normal people level hallucination is just like a wink to them(all laugh) so would've taken 20 seconds to flee to all hells never imagining any return(all laugh) and yeah family would've been involved too(all laugh) AH!the beauty(all laugh),no just that moment after Lance told me i sent Chu away first inside the ball and then just chewed the Platue to my insatiable appetite for chewing that moment(all laugh),anyway men were too happy and said well this is why they had decided to have the days chat for a long time(all laugh) cause Gengar life is really funny(all laugh) and all cause their women are naive(all burst into laughter) i was thinking yeah but well knows the friends atleast(all laugh,Brock .ly laughs) i said well as they should be(All laugh) before their own emotions settle down cause they have to deal with more emotions than men as such is the life(all laugh) then men said yeah we understand but we guess for them Gengars don’t suit(all uncontrollaly laugh) i said why not the mental level matters cause Gengar’s are known to have only one for whole life(all burst into laughter,.) said yeah Gengars are perfect to follow in life(all burst into laughter) my Gengley was there as i said told me that i was broing them out to show that i can tickle better than them(all laugh) i told them just shut up(all laugh) and thought well that’s your Gengleye life(All laugh) so then i said well their society they may have different opinions(all laugh) said well may be but Gyaradoses aren’t good(all laugh) i said yeah neither is Tyranitar,Solgaleo,Yveltal and so on(all laugh) said yeah pretty true(all laugh) but anyway we were curious to know about you then and then later during your Elite4 in Unova a certain date that we asked and then was fixed and all then we thought mighte’ve been a chance that you were off cause was too respectful of you(all laugh) so that day eventual call comes that the date isn’t possible(all laugh) before we go out of home and then first time we hear crying and all and then yeah our menhood were questioned(all laugh) politely(all laugh) so we thought it was that we must somehow challenge you in a battle and then say that this the result and then decide and so we went there and then the reality strikes again so we’re so happy that we did go(all laugh) i said yeah well always good to have no illusions but then men said that they were happy to get all these talks cause this now absolutely is ready to be described that they said as the realizions comes to us we’re saying our view on the total picture that we were the pawn in the drama(all burst into laughter) as we also recalled that Mr Oak weren’t happy with few men who were such pawns as well as each sister exacpt the youngest were properly prepared by the head to be truely brilliant dramatists(all uncontrollably laugh,Daisy in tears laughing) but the gentleman was too naive(all uncontrillably laugh,tears) so didn’t realize the trick(all laugh) for which his quote was most apt(all laugh) and Mr Oak was hard to pawn against so the drama didn’t prolong enough for the pet much to the teacher’s dismay(all uncontrollably laugh,Daisy in convulsions of laughter in tears,Tracey uncontrollably laughs,Lillie uncontrollably laughs,Gary laughs .ly) cause thus the drama didn’t have the the joint ending the head hoped for as she gave the 2nd command a free role as she herself had surpassed the authority in wicked planning(all uncontrollably laugh,tears fits of laughter,all sisters have have convulsions and fits from laughing with tears,Tracey and Brock in tears laughing and Gary has fits of laughter,Misty same pose smiles at Ash resting her head on his chest) as the moment she debuted as a singer to fool the world that she is the best among them thus having a burgain over the teacher and involving the youngest pushed the teacher away from spotlight to feed her to the Cascade (all uncontrollably laugh) which the teacher countered by implying to the yougest that the 2nd can be only toppled if the yougest uses the Gyarados the most  to show the whole world that she is an unique talent in both parts and not the very best but only in one to shrewdly show the 2nd that gym battling can be superior that she thought herself to be above of(all uncontrolllably laugh) but the teacher didn’t pay much attention to the youngest that being a Gyarados means the pwans will be devoured quicker to the teachers liking thus you were ushurped without a moment’s notice(all uncontrollably laugh) but then the teacher had two serious issues to deal with the 2nd command had revolted against authority(all uncontrollbaly laugh) by feeding the Gyarados with ideas of husband and family to the pet who was the perfect person to mix the two sides to produce her own solution that appeased both sides to keep the pawns blinded to maximum span while the authority figures thought her to be the best confident thus positioning herself securedly in between by riding the Gyarados(all uncontrollably laugh) who was now told to put up a civil mask thus at each performance or battle she can unleash better being starved first to show you that she was herslef the pawn against you(all uncontrollably laugh) now this appeased the 2nd command cause now she could safely hold a sway over the show while the teacher held the authority over the gym thus equal share was implied(all uncontrollably laugh) and thus the pet was crudely laughing as she could now see-saw between sides to pawn against Mr Oak(all uncontrollably laugh) and the 2nd command showing freedom of expression held sawy over Brock who anyway is a too caring man(all uncontrollably laugh) and the main script writer was holding sway over the gentleman by shoving the Gyarados sister down him so that he has a constant headache over the lunacy level and thus be too engaged to notice the cunning games of the head(all uncontrollably laugh) now this didn’t make the Gyarados happy at all cause she had been first improperly prepared to sentimentally write scripts then wasn’t prepared enough with the sly ideas of expression of freedom that were hidden below the mask of the ideal husband(all uncontrollably laugh) and then the pet didn’t teach her the swinging methods to control the saliva before the food is ready(all uncontrollbaly laugh) thus the Gyarados first thing did was to gobble you up later realized the stomach was aching cause the food wasn’t given enough time to get totally boiled so started her own games at playing the martyr citing the exact ache by not using the verbal chutney to digest the food and removing the ache by confessing it(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) and then the 2nd command was being shakled down by the teacher as the pet was enjoying the sway stuggle cause she can use every pawn against Mr Oak cause he can’t get professionally involved in the gym but will be awaiting for the chance impatiently thus his studies would be hampered and won’t get the chance to go away from the 3 city circle cause then she herself must play the martyr which her younger Gyarados was doing but cause she was a Gyarados whe was doing it improperly by roaming around in front of you and yet complaing to you about the ache feigning that it was a normal ache of quarrels and not that of indigestion(all uncontrollably laugh) so you may be forced to look after her only thus getting Melody Sanders out of the picture cause you could use her as a pawn to counter the ache to burst(all uncontrollably laugh) but as she is a Gyarados never could stop the saliva from simmering up uncontrollably at the smell of the food(all uncontrollably laugh) but this the pet couldn’t do cause she couldn’t get into college and thus kept her pawn games up and Mr Oak busy enough to hamper his studies to keep him near the gym after he got the research license and using that exact sentimental trick of hampering aptly described by the head and provied with the desart of the greatest husband idea(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) will show that she was the reason behind the limited success so she was to be blamed and as Mr Oak sympathizes with her will show him why only cause of that she gave up her freedom of expression(all uncontrollably laugh) and Brock was kept busy by the 2nd command using the Gyarados card and showing the lunacy was there cause of more proximity thus she could play her games with expression of freedom going with Brock while the teacher got it easy with the man being gentle(all uncontrollably laugh) but because of the Gyarados too dangerously salivating the 3 siniters got scared as if she herself prepare the verbal chutney will mean that each three will get a hold on the Gyarados by fooling you with the starter lab sentiment and 1st gym badge sentiment to lull you in appeasing the Gyarados more than necessary(all uncontrollbaly laugh) exposing the sentimental sister shoving game busted by getting a replacement showing that the Gyarados was happier than the head to cajole her into self preparation of the chutney(all uncontrollably laugh) and Mr Oak could use your professionality to insinuate(all uncontrollably laugh) to the pet that swinging around didn’t make the Gyarados happy but paying respect to the food did(all uncontrollably laugh) and Brock could show that you’re not using the freedom of expression at all by carrying the unemployed non earning Gyarados on your shoulders at her lunatic mood swinging whims(all uncontrollably laugh) so to counter this the head planned to pawn the Cascade itself by selling it to the pawns(all uncontrollably laugh) and getting them queued up cause Viridian and Pewter won’t allow their family memebers at such scripting and acting in dramas(all uncontrollably laugh) now the 2nd  command got a sway over the head by agreeing to tour to throw her superiority at the head’s face and exactly what the pet wanted to get the see-saw going(all unocntrollbaly laugh) thus they cajoled the Gyarados to vomit you out by parting with you first(all uncontrollably laugh) then played sentimental martyr tricks on you as the 3 siniters directed to get yourself to prepare the curry to appease the Gyarados verbally which as if she couldn’t do it herself and this is that bias card most crudely played by the 2nd  command to lull Brock into the couldron(all uncontrollably laugh) and then the Gyarados went on with the martyr tricks by seeing you off to the voyges by exactly announcing decisions to first get into the show after you just had appeased her with verbal dessert cause she was unable to bear the fact that others would even smell the food at her absense(all uncontrollably laugh) thus kept you distracted from your pursuits like the pet did with Mr Oak by forcing you to her martyrdom and the whole drama thus proceeded till your Tyranitar being a mortal enemy realized the trick(all uncontrollbaly laugh) now the Gyarados couldn’t digest the fact how can a rock type in a water gym get away with the match so she fanatically booked new shows to keep up the martyr up to you which Tyranitar again foiled by getting the bug type involved(all uncontrollably laugh) now the martyr was confused herself as to how can the smell itself attract flies(all uncontrollably laugh) so her martyr game couldn’t go on thus directly out of blue rejected you you make sure that Tyranitar isn’t allowed in water gyms but Tyranitar implied to the water duo themselves to enter the game(all uncontrollably laugh) so they by misbehaving and rubbing the ghost psychics the wrong way using Solgly and Yvely(all uncontrollably laugh) who were relishing the opportunity to roast the Gyarados who tried to play the martyr by using the cup won as if she was so much in heartache yet went to shows never cared to go to the finals herself as the mask would’ve been removed(all uncontrollably laugh) so Solgy and Yvely countered this by getting the whole psychic dark ghost group incensed to get the non psychics by hallucinating them to force you down the cover and thus fed us to their compatriot Gyarados directly to totally get the size advantgae down to negetivity(all uncontrollably laugh) now the Gyarados first continued the show exactly around one more year so and then getting off cause just after you came out and thus the martyr was again there at the expense of the 2nd command(all uncontrollably laugh) the 2nd command was at a loss as now the teacher finally after long wait could influence the Gyarados more towards the sentiment side than to the expressive side(all uncontrollably laugh) the pet obviously was waiting for the oppotunity to get the 2nd command down by siding with the teacher now while only sympathizing with the second command thus keeping the option of swinging open while sharing the control over the show and keeping Mr Oak in the game of professionality intact(all uncontrollably laugh) while the gentleman was all trapped and the trouble was that the second command had nothing to hold sawy over Brock so she started doing extremely emotional songs and exactly most shows at Viridian(all uncontrollbaly laugh) yet keeping the expression game up by foxing Brock with adding atleast one line in each song meant she will expressively burgain and play the pawns(all uncontrollably laugh) now finally we were left as samples so now all three shoved us down this drama to roll play as the martyr for the Gyarados to hide beind(all uncontrollably laugh) now then at this background your bunch countered the Gyarados and each of the three crooks(all uncontrollbaly laugh) by changing the definition of battling and now the Gyarados’ game of great gym leader was done for(all uncontrollably laugh) and the show if restarted menat the martyr was going to bumerang(all uncontrollably laugh) thus now we were used on sentimental scale particulary by the great preacher of the game who used the Cerulian background to her full advatage(all uncontrollbaly laugh) now we were being insinuated(all uncontrollbaly laugh) that the illusion is going to be not so while the Gyarados was patiently waiting to get into the hall of fame to prey upon you again(all uncontrollably laugh) cause now though she wasn’t any match to Feraligator or Crawdaunt but still stayed as the Golduck with a headcahe for the authority to call you to intervene(all uncontrollably laugh) and in the meantime the teacher now being reinvigorated after the marriage so that now the gentleman himself would voluteer to be the lackie(all uncontrollbaly laugh) and the 2nd command finally getting under Brock’s skin enough to get married(all uncontrollably laugh) and comeback against the teacher to support us while the teacher was trying to feed us to the Tauros while the pet stayed neutral observing the scene to decide which side to sail to behind Mr Oak’s professional behaviour(all uncontrollably laugh) now we were at bay so we asked the Gyarados of her rage level which was slyly showed being instructed by the teacher to be down and thus cajoled the biggest mistake out the’s a nickname(all uncontrollbaly laugh) we had not the remotest idea why a most obvious nickname used by the head infront of us again and again will be guarded against by the Gyarados to then fully jump us by questioning the manhoods and getting the emotion up out of control exactly according to the wish of the head who rubbed us the wrong way to feed us to the Salamences back with poor Kyogres as curries(all uncontrollbaly laugh) now we get there and thankfully you realizing the drama let us off so we came back and politely told the head and the concerned professional about our inability to get our Kyogre roasted in this family drama involving Gyarados,Dewgong,Cloyster and Mantine most cunning Kanto water types(all uncontrollably laugh) Gyarados used the rage to her advantage to be at all 3 places land of matryrdom,sky of womanhood and undercurrent of sentiment to trick you from everywhere(all uncontrollably laugh) Dawgong coolly observed the procedure by feinging to be unable to move quickly on the land of reality of being a gym leader thus being at the sly waters of mixture cause the reality meant the moisture was same everywhere for the gentleman to easily feast upon with erected years(all uncontrollably laugh) the Cloyster sat under the water feinging an innocent mask to psychic anyone that went near jovially while the inconsistant waves of the water baffled Mr Oak(all uncontrollably laugh) and the Mantine you can understand is the most sly-fox as by getting at whim both under the water of responsibility and the sky of expression(all unocotrollably laugh,tears) to get Brock at a distance and then emotionally baiting him(all uncontrollably laugh) but your bunch realized this trick to hold sawy over them and cunningly used each type advantages together to baffle the Gyarados while Tauros did the favour to us by saving the 21 years but we decided to feed the Gyarados with another idea to get the revenge on each saying that if places were exchanged then we would’ve called you and not wait for the call cause while you were at undercover we were only playing family drama of heartfails to heartbreaks to heataches to hearty reunions(all uncontrollably laugh) so the Golduck psychiced  us off but we were very happy that either the headache will bust and will run back to you or survive till gets the hall of fame so that then gets another pawn to burgain with which she is doing now but with our resignation from the company the advisory board and their pet has been kicked away for good(all uncontrollbaly laugh) and the Gyarados was playing the martyr to Lance as we said which she couldn’t do before cause she wasn’t in hall of fame officially to pawn Lance(all uncontrollably laugh) thus the insignificant yet responsible position card couldn’t be used as though your bunch got that respect away for the hall of fame couldn’t remove the human sentiments and Lance(all uncontrollbaly laugh) and the show couldn’t restart due to the trick getting exposed and your water duo got the battle idea meaningless to send of the hard talented suffering gym martyr out of the world so person cards must be tried first as they may themselves do the job but now playing a matryr again and using Lance as a pawn has forced you to date her again(all uncontrollably laugh and .) where we will be shown as not being men thus trying to again cajole you in preparing the pudding yourself as if it was all your fault to get number of dates extended as each one of us will get separate dates to demonstrate the lack of manhood but not at the same time to keep your bunch away from you(all uncontrollbaly laugh),convulsions of laughter),this is exactly what that quote Brock said means which saved us from the paychecks and those 4 siniters’ motto is to unnesseciate the necessary of not cooking the self if the necessity is the subtle burgaining(all uncontrollbaly laugh,fits and convulsions of laughter,tears)..any opinions(all uncontrollably laugh) i said lets ask the dramatists and the subjects(all laugh)...Mr Oak Mr Oak...(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh,fits of laughter) : “no wonder you perfromed against it so well(all laugh)...”
Lillie(laugh,tears convulsions of laughter) : “this is at another level entirely(all laugh,fits of laughter) what’s the 2nd command’s position in sway struggle(all burst into laughter,fits of laughter)..”
Violet(laugh,convulsion of laughter and tears) : “in-between pawns(all burst into laughter)..this is legendary stuff(all laugh) Ketchum who’s the script writer(all burst into laughter)”
Ash(laugh) : “he who kept the picture all along 6 years till the moment to insinuate through the history of gyms to a room and getting it cleared of vultures including himself(all burst into laughter) for 30 minutes and coming back 10 minutes earlier to enjoy the result at Nivy’s expense of aging arms putting the same on my shoulders to simulate and parahrase the crook that girlfriend is indeed heavenly(all uncontrollably laugh,fits and convulsions of laughter,tears)”
Brock(laugh,fits of laughter,tears in laughter) : “i’m going to grill the brat on this drama(all laugh)..along with Lance(all uncontrollably laugh,fits of laughter)..but is the teacher alive(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh,fits and convulsions of laughter,tears) : “hardly(fits of laughter) no wonder Ketchum is legend girlfriend gazing now(all uncontrollably laugh)”
Tracey(laugh,tears,fits of laughter) : “but still it was only the gentleman who came out with flying colours(all uncontrollably laugh,fits of laughter) Gyarados flower digested  or vomitting the drama(all uncontrollably laugh)”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “it’s how i adjust my projection of my sweet bee...you(all burst into laughter) are just namecalled pawns(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well,after this i said yeah great to see such a great drama but how are you sure that i’m here to end the drama(all laugh) said,no juts that feeling(all burst into laughter) so i said well thanks for your time i must digest the drama for the preparation of which you had to take up a long year through many things but i just want to know that Hoenn could’ve been chosen why Orange said no didn’t get a place but will be trying as soon as possible to get away especially given Palkia and so on are there(all laugh)...then i thanks and finally got out of the theatre(all laugh)..total that meeting took 2 hours(all laugh)..never shared it even with Mist today just recalled and then outside laughed for half an hour(all laugh) then finally went out and set towards Kanto(all laugh)...then anyway i hardly needed to know anything else about whole 5 years of drama going on still for 19 long years with pawns and dramatists and cunning water types being implied by Tyrani and then getting Solgy and Yvely in to force undercover and gentleman and Mr Oak and Brock and Playboy Ketchum and what not(all laugh)..anyway,the other parts i didn’t tell you before only Mist knows,but Trace beauty,beauty(all laugh)...but Oh Trace this was not the END of beauty(all laugh)..cause i also happened to meet so many beautiful men(all laugh) and women(all burst into laughter)..cause they are with those men now a few(all burst into laughter)..but i know why a Mr jackal is too inerested about this(all laugh)..cause Mr jackal suddenly now with Lugias being from Kalos is apprehensive of the sinister(all laugh) that if Blosie and Jas anyone or both goes to Venturiastrog(all laugh) then what to do about the beauty(all laugh)..just send them here for classes after 13 (all laugh)..but Gili is not coming here for classes only for fun cause the classes will be taken by the great Lord in true honesty of ethical honesty of ethics of honesty of morality of true ethics(all laugh)..truth is another ethical issue of course(all laugh)..anyway(all laugh),i am more brutal on male brats as usual cause i myself am(all burst into laughter)...right(all laugh)..anyway(all laugh) so i met some beautiful men who were so overjoyed that they contacted the gym AGAIN(all laugh)...due to the Ivysaur group those men has to keep contact cause Harris alone wont suffice as he’s too busy with the contests and of course few beautiful men due to conference itself has to keep contact so they were summond but conference congress stuff was hard as out of my hand but here i played the sentimental card of a shared ribbon(all laugh) to show the Kanto Conference Congrece that i too can do the beautiful shows as obvious(all laugh)..had to budge cause of sentimental card i just got the contacts went there Glalied them(all laugh)...so the beautiful grass(all laugh)..went there in their place after meeting the more than most beautiful men then came straight to less beautiful men and asked him about matters at hand,were too happy and i said why do they still waste their time there in the gym took me inside homes thus met some beautiful women(all laugh) and had a chat and it’s amusing that how in these days men and women unless ugly(all laugh) knows everything about each other(all laugh)..AH,beauty beauty(all laugh)..Glalie was all along only enjoying later hallucinating less beautiful men and women(all laugh)..so that turned out to be a herd of ardent fans of Cili(all laugh) so that went easily but this time the beautiful women beaked my head off(all laugh)..asking about Sceptile legal swelling substances(all laugh)..talked for some times then asked that why everyone thinks i was the head of team rocket(all laugh)..then the men and women in unison said they will be so happy if i were at the gym(all laugh)..i said yeah we’ll see(all laugh)...these men came at the show(all laugh)...later the men and the women said like,’um..why didn’t you win Kanto and Johto too,then Sinnoh itself would’ve been it(all laugh)’..i said well yeah bad luck(all laugh)...these men are my fans now(all laugh)..cause they didn’t realize that winning 5 leagues is hard(all laugh)..then they didn’t realize the actual from reality thus the ending scene and all made the women and men realize that there are 1000 ways to represent the same reality out of which none is true cause it’s just representation thus said,’um..if that is truth,why didn’t you do the show after Johto(all laugh)..i said no at that age and at this the different issues that we face(all burst into laughter)...told them a quote too happy went off later said that they quote around among each other...really this is posterboy(all laugh)...the quote was,’beauty in apprearence beauty in scenes/beautiful am i by all these means/but beautiful are these cause only i see/isn’t the most beautiful then me and only me(all laugh and .)...got the meaning with that scene probably the first lesson as well to the kids(all laugh)...posterold stuff(all laugh)...yeah(all laugh),all will get free self reflection classes now(all laugh)...anyway so bunch of Cilis went(all laugh)..then beautiful conferences played sentimental card of trying to settle differences(all laugh)...had to budge cause had a shared ribbon(all laugh),i straight went and said i want to enter contests want to have 5 minute matches with Tyranitar(all burst into laughter)..Giratina of all was there with Ultranercozma suddenly appeared(all laugh)..right in pursuit of darkness(all laugh)..told the legend can you tell me why the sun is not constantly bright every moment(all burst into laughter)..men realized it’s a serious matter cause this man is playing the card that conference congress doesn’t give respect to trainers(all laugh)..and has entered a civic office with a Giratina and an Ultranercozma to add to(all burst into laughter)..then i beaked their heads off with Entei vs Raiku for 5 minutes(all laugh) with all illegal substances then went 300 levels up to Ghostradarkarrigussonor(all laugh) vs the same(all laugh)...another 5 minutes on cosmic darkness which none will understand unless they have atleast trained a Hytostohurakanom themselves(all laugh)..and is still alive(all laugh)..the normal not swelled up(all laugh)..anyway,men realized that i’m threatening them that i will start to trash talk the conference system(all laugh) and they will be the gateway(all laugh) and  the press conference will be reviewed by a Giratina and/or an Ultranercozma behind invisibility(all burst into laughter) and can’t help it cause i had a ribbon and i was detailing legendary contests and then a name that only researchers know about except a very few trainers or contest people(all laugh) meaning i know only too well how 5 minute matches are played and more importantly each 10th second can be done illegaly with a Entei and a Raiku(all laugh) on exactly what attacks and in which condition of the legends themselves(al laugh) and none since Sinnoh asks me about the most beautiful scene cause that was 10 years back and if then but certainly not now a days one wants a lunatic battle-starved Lightenthunstrom indoor(all laugh)..or Yveltal(all burst into laughter) or Rayquaza suddenly blinking surrounding you when you're at that type of washroom(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)..hence the men’s lives were foisted upon me since first day at school(all burst into laughter) primary that is(all burst into laughter)..to which i participated(all burst into laughter) cause i was more than most beautified(all laugh)..yeah knew the marks as well(all laugh uncontrollably)..then i was introduced to beautiful women as well(all laugh)...and again the same school(all burst into laughter)..who were less overjoyed to withhold the marks to themselves(all burst into laughter)..the paper was in both cases the final year(all laugh) ..but i was told that a certain Misty ‘mam was extremely Gyaradosy then(all laugh)..right(all laugh) but i of all people was inquired about her Gyarados(all burst into laughter,.)..yeah actions bears fruits in same life(all burst into laughter)..right(all laugh),so the next question was how controlling a Gyarados of all did she has become so so all caring later(all burst into laughter) which is an insinuation(all laugh) but i waited(all laugh) cause i knew it was just the preperation(all laugh) for the final culmination(all laugh) thus eventually Giratina and Ultranercozma doesn’t have to come out cause they don’t specify names(all laugh) then i was forced into a lie detector system(all laugh) out of invisibility that is(all burst into laughter) as i was asked how despite all success and legendary name has the concerned ‘mam become so misty(all burst into laughter)..now at that point a heinous ZEAL(all laugh) got the better of me,i started to fool around with the word misty(all laugh)...so i said the trouble is that the mental mist covered the person name Misty who by luck had a misbehaving Gyarados just evolving from Magikarp as the famous story goes befriended that Gyarados,Gyarados being a dragon type anyway would’ve helped the name of the gym but Ms Misty Waterflower was too overealous with all her talents and thus at the end of the day the mist of mental fatigue has covered her it’s no big deal such people has a lot to deal with only cause they are too good in many aspects but if they wanted my opinion then i said look senors i’ve had the fortune to travel around the world and excluding this Cerulian City gym visited 1249 gyms(all burst into laughter) out of which 1234 were hall of fames when i went there(all laugh) and then this excludes many which later became hall of fames like Cerulian and Safforn has so in Unova i’ve travelled 300 and then 45 total 425 hall of fame gyms hosting such Giratinas and Ultranercozmas in floks(all laugh) some of those leaders were PHYSICALLY(all laugh) much more beautiful than this concerned Ms Waterflower(all laugh) if there was a clase peresnt at present that is(all laugh) but they weren’t obsessed with that or their responsibility so much as this Ms Misty Waterflower did and now they themselves can see what this obsession with responsibility has done cause at 22 the issues that we have(all laugh) at 35 they don’t reflect anymore(all laugh) from the self cause by now the time has passed on 13 more years shoing to be precise except the smallest amount imaginable(all laugh) so we we are at 35 but looking at 22 and then did the opposite so we don’t know where we are(all laugh) or at which exact time did the dusk turned into night(all laugh) so now this great mist of depression has grasped her as she realizes the pursuit to be happy can’t be ended and thus being unhappy is happy(all burst into laughter) which this mist created inside the mistic mind of Ms Misty Waterflower(all laugh) and thus this trouble where ethics and morality and honesty are becoming a major issue(all laugh) that’s why we must know from others about ourselves each moment(all burst into laughter)all the while remembering we can’t know them and they can’t know us cause they’re not me and i’m not them(all burst into laughter) and so bacically we must know how to be afraid of certain things(all laugh) while being ourselves and not another self(all burst into laughter) and about the Gyarados and the plans to distribute her attacks(all laugh) so that she feels comfortable to not feel weak(all laugh) or that her attacks were somehow hindering her mental well being(all burst into laughter),being born already to being with then evolving to worsen it(all burst into laughter) is a great picture it presents but like a perfect hallucination(all laugh) it has no perfect point where one can say exactly at this moment i’m neither dreaming no in normal cognition(all laugh) so thus these are too insignificant to me now as i think about why a pokemon evolves actually(all burst into laughter) or like what exactly is a pokemon(all burst into laughter) cause their attacks are not they for sure(all burst into laughter) so though these questinos are so beautiful(all laugh) and everything else too is so beautiful(all laugh) that we must know how to think one by one counting the timespan(all laugh) that should be deployed there else this running after things won’t ever end(all burst into laughter) so now the colourfull question that i’m very interested to discolour(all laugh) so that i know the actual origination of the colour(all laugh) which is the question that is a battle between Hytostohurakanom vs Capxexil(all laugh)...so this slaughtering of Ms Waterflower totally dumbfounded them then that language(all burst into laughter) and those legends with their type’s specifications(all laugh) along with 1250 gyms(all laugh) and a Giratina to suddenly appear anwhere in a bedroom(all burst into laughter) and there's Ultranercozma of course when you run to the bath side(all burst into laughter) sweetened the deal(all burst into laughter) cause that is the whole point of Cili followerhood(all laugh)..but this bought some time(all laugh and .) using which i said i was enlightened upon schools but i had had the fortune of attending 3 lectures in universities but i there prefered to sit in different chairs right in front of the lecturer(all laugh)..do the two agree to my sentiment(all laugh)..to which they happily disagreed(all laugh)..they asked about my shools(all laugh),quoted them cause it was 2 hours(all laugh)..,’this is beatutiful whatever i see/indeed all great but where’s me/they are there cause only i see/then why to bother what’s not me/not knowing me but another/what’s not dependent upon me to bother/thus why not know myself rather/than trying to know an other’(all laugh and .)...this flattened them in too much glee(all laugh)..said when are you announcing(all laugh)..’yeah will have a match’(all laugh)..then i came back to Cerulian...Cerulian,Cerulian,Cerulian(all laugh)...these men and women also came as the soulmates(all laugh),’um..why didn’t you marry before Unova(all laugh)’,’that’s the point of the show,senors(all laugh)’...’um..then the impressions(all burst into laughter)...’,’all to own,senors,that’s the point(all laugh)’,’um..we see difficult,difficult(all laugh)’,’senors,best wishes for your happy journey forward till you strive to be together beyond the eventual as again to start another then to do so if individual comes and goes then what’s more suitable is to know is the individual by the same individual then that knowledge isn’t that enough to tell you why you’ll be ever forever’(all laugh and .)...almost ate me up(all laugh)..didn’t get it,you was singular(all burst into laughter)..then few people congratulated Mist as well as you know the motto is,’um..but ‘mam does he always tell you such things’(all burst into laughter)..all too happy but the only trouble is if they come here for visit they have only learnt about soulmates but now they should reflect it(all laugh)...some brat that is(all laugh)..and actually this all is because all men and women are extremely succesful in their profession and all thus me having the luck to have my bunch my friends and family and all,knew they will realize everything thus the personal endeavours(all smile)..anyway,so thus i guess those who knew they loved my fake fight with Mist(all laugh)...and i just love my sweet flower’s disposition when angry(all laugh)..too sweet..Daisy please that one again(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “ ‘um,’mam(all laugh)...i saw your few matches now i ever felt that my Cascade badge was all your kindness(all laugh)...’,’Ketchum are you sane(all burst into laughter)..you confessed to my baby sis last night and next morning you’re here watching battles together(all laugh)..get the hell out of here and take her with you(all laugh),’no ‘mam see she’s enjoying the battles now talking with the referee(all burst into laughter)..may i have a rematch(all laugh uncontrollably) you battle brilliantly Dewgong againt my Feraligator..(all burst into laughter)..well now that match everyday happens(all laugh)..’,’Ketchum,Mist will be battling here till break against you constantly in 30 vs 30(all laugh)..bye’,’wait wait wait,’mam that’s exactly what i’m talking about(all burst into laughter) but not as you think,i want to see Mist’s battling techinques against challengers(all laugh uncontrollably)...’,’KETCHUM!are you..you..do you even know what is decency..HOW DARE YOU SAY..’,and this is exactly why you know he could face all those legends later calmly says,’my girlfriend so why can’t i’(all laugh and .)...then i realize that unless he gets his ways he’ll spoil my poor Dewgy(all laugh)...and this to me was ego then cause again he uses his sentiment and if he says Mist will herself make the arrangements(all laugh) but he’s showing us that we have to give him the respect cause he’s her boyfriend but now i realize that just honesty that why would i hide something from her family cause she’s my girlfriend...absolutely nonchalant to her family once she has accepted him...Ash,what if mom and dad was here(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “2 words(all uncontrollably laugh)...as you know the 3rd day other way(all burst into laughter)..17 weeks at both homes(all laugh)..i know her much more than you(all burst into laughter) either she is my daughter-in-law or your beloved wife stays out of here(all burst into laughter)..and knowing my mom and dad whom i didn’t see unfortunately,mom would’ve forced me to impersonate Drew while i stayed away(all laugh) and dad would’ve never given that badge but a list on his baby doll’s habits(all laugh)..loose motions,yeah(all burst into laughter)..’...so easy just two words(all laugh)..soulmates by all means(all laugh)..so please the curtains(all laugh)”
Daisy(laugh) : “ so later he tells Mist(all laugh) and i show him the curtains(all burst into laughter)..then he arranges it sending his sister and all away with me and Lil for the day...whole day girlfriend gazing(all laugh) while battling(all laugh and .)...what a day Ash?(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “YOUNG FLOWER DREAM(all burst into laughter,.,cheer for Misty,Misty blushes and hides her face hugging Ash very firmly,Ash laughs and tenders her)...the best possible seat(all burst into laughter,Misty blushes hard and lightly smacks Ash,Ash laughs and hugs her very firmly,Misty smiles and keeps hugging Ash very firmly)...still blushing and smacking me(all burst into laughter and chees for Misty)...(all laugh)..a bit Gyaradosy though(all laugh)..no cosmetics(all burst into laughter)..yeah cosmetics are why never saw a show(all laugh)..i only saw one after battle frontier which had a jackal(all laugh)...whoose daycalls spoiled Violet’s great work(all burst into laughter)...and a certain impersonal man when i told him about his wig’s performane(all laugh),’um..yeah,yeah..be professional(all laugh)..but wait,did she look very..um..nice(all burst into laughter)...’..i said i was on-the-fly that is(all burst into laughter)..but a Crook(all laugh) got his way too easily cause it was mainly the voice(all burst into laughter)...anyway Daisy,i ever wondered that i know my other two sisters were much more focused on the show and all but you certainly could be as good as Mist if not much better if you wanted to in battling but why was that all cause you fondled the bunch so much(all laugh)...”
Daisy(laugh) : “more than pretty much(all laugh)...and the show was always i just played the supporting role that’s all but had to battle and had to learn the skills quickly but i really as you know wasn’t much interested in battling rather being with the bunch(all laugh) and that nature never left me so Dewgong and then the jackal was ultimately spoiled(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “jackals are spoiled exactly that way as only the days know the best METHODS(all laugh)what we saw the lesser methods(all laugh) was that jackals are definitely spoiled but only if Scyther is fodnled midmatch(all laugh)...still remember,in Orange forced him in a bug/fly competition(all laugh)..for which my toffee-flower didn’t talk with him for next two days(all laugh)..he asks but he too(all laugh)..’SHUT UP!MY..um..(all laugh)..Buzzwole is very sweet(all burst into laughter),UNLIKE YOUR Scyther(all laugh)..’..in general always Ash,if angry my Ash(all laugh) if my Ash needed to be complained against he only(all laugh) that is never liking his better friend(all laugh) and if she didn’t get her ways with other by physical violence(all laugh)..’Ash..only you are my friend..best friend..very best..um..friend(all laugh)’...later always my Ash except when the age is too much(all laugh)..sweet Gyarados(all laugh)..so Trace battles,first round 30 seconds Venonat recalled after 1 blow at 13 seconds(all laugh), Scyther goes against Armaldo(all burst into laughter) and mid match Scyther took two blows and was just warmed up and just about to shine his blades(all laugh),jumps in(all laugh),’NO,THIS IS INHUMAN(all burst into laughter)..’,Scyther was so upset(all laugh)...so match that was...so Mr jackal what about that 5 minutes for ribbon the inhuman at 1 minutes 49 seconds(all burst into laughter)..and then letting Dordrio go(all laugh)...’
Tracey(laugh) : “just that the day was SO GLORIOUS(all laugh)...today i can barely say anything else(all laugh)..what a date that was(all laugh)..but anyway Ash,don’t tell the future to come upto me out of blue and say,hi dad can i runaway with my husband at 16(all burst into laughter)..and even more stunningly on 2nd day at 16 that dad!dad!my husband is so sweetie(all burst into laughter) ”
Ash(laugh) : “like a Lugia(all burst into laughter),a deal that is(all burst into laughter)..no that they will only do as they will be in Venturiastrog,1st day,1st SHOW..UM..lecture..(all burst into laughter)...wherever don’t forget to chart the E and motions(all laugh and .)....right(all burst into laughter),and with that chart may today end a toast for all from parts of our master the Lugias(all laugh and reciprocate).. see you anytime suddenly,bye(all reciprocate and bye)
................................................................................................................................................................
(4 days later,middle,31,Mn)

Ash(laugh) : “anyway so i was perfectly seated(all laugh)..after the night’s emotion of confession to my Mist as better freind wife to tell her that now Mist you’re my girlfriend wife(all laugh)..so(all laugh)Mist was battling now as my wife(all laugh)..had my observations(all laugh) and all but that buffoon didn’t teach me sketching so that i can’t eavesdrop him(all laugh),second half shut down to Pearl’s(all laugh)...then again next day went out all the same,anyway,so they invite me,i trash talk them and then my flower insinuating the r word(all laugh)...that was a bad day really for me anyway Mist i knew would be incensed and then the match of course i knew she will have no clue what is happening then before match asked her for a date if i won(all laugh) wore gloves else..um..(all burst into laughter)...anyway(all laugh),thanks for persistence(all laugh)...right(all laugh),then the match ends tell shake her hand tell her that’s the date(all laugh)...so(all laugh),this was to get that idea of 13 years out of her mind and show people that how humiliating it actually is and how lucky they were that the Elite4 wasn’t informed a single time in all the years you all have been there...and atleast till the next generation won’t be cause of a certain Pikachu(all burst into laughter)...Hana said,’um..Ash..isn’t your Chu too much fond of us(all burst into laughter)..’ by the way the whole place has been directed by sweet sweet Cili cause all except distinct seniors are may i be excused Misty ‘mam and hey namecall Ashey-boy(all laugh),immediately namecall come here and clear the callname pool we’re going for a date(all burst into laughter)..yeah after show everybody’s private life has been foisted upon me(all laugh),only to be Gengleyed(all laugh)..anyway after match all the things went on i just managed a few words as i said with Sarah and Brauch and all,Hana got me later just before i was exiting dragged me in private was apprehensive said what if Mist’s condition deteriorates in this humiliation,i just said don’t worry she ever had this burden that she had to be a great responsible gym leader and affectionate big sister to all that isn’t who she is as you all know what she was with me when i was around that is the real thing only and missing that in this pressure just poked at that now she’ll manage herself better and this obsession with responsibility will reduce to negetive level,’um..just a thing Ash,won’t you..’,’Hana,enough,i must go you know it was public and i’ll have to entertain them again now,just manage it here don’t let them disturb any of you.we’ll see what happens later,bye.’...so walk out public was crazy,did some antics of politeness(all laugh) to drive them away went to a dark place in the street and flew off via Giratina then Dragonite went straight to Indigo Platue at 9:30...now i kept my water team there in pokeballs at the main HQ office and then look who were with me for fast travelling as you know i always have my full dragon group at fast flying but i just had so so many that day(all laugh)
Dragonite,Rayquaza,Zekrom,Garchomp,Yveltal,Hydreigon,Glalie,Jellicent,Latios,Reshiram,Ultranercozma,Giratina,Uxie,Deoxys,Musharna,Beeheeyem,Meowstic,Celebi,Gourgeist,Reuniclas,Unown,Metagross,Bronzong,Magearna,Claydol,Darkrai,Malamar,Gengar,Sableye,Spiritomb,Rotom,Noivern,Greninja,Hoopa,Confragigus,Banette,Mismagius,Dusknoir,Chanedlure,Aegislash,Marshadow,Decidueye,Whimsicott,Ribombee and Gardevoir(all laugh)...45 in total(all laugh)..now we reach Cerulian(all laugh)..Cerulian,Cerulian,Cerulian..(all laugh)..then first the first thing we do is to deploy teams to create a all ghost dark dragon psychic cover to create an outside guard over the whole gym which is like the 2 walls of the gym which must be broken first by any pokemon and this was done cause we were going to almost break the first wall so this for protection,then the second wall will be broken not completely but to mitigate the effect then we have to tackle the reservation and then we will proceed to control the whole gym then finally i’ll get my sweet Mist flower(all laugh) exactly from where i’m talking now and my flower in on my head(all laugh) then so we proceed but our afraid Spiritomb asks shouldn’t you be afraid of your unknown signals cause you’re seriously countering the fear(all burst into laughter)...i told you brat just go on with it(all laugh) this is cause that brat was to break the second wall thus more seriously cause it’s more delicate and sensitive than the first so the first wall’s choised brats were given the less serious job thus Spiritomb wasn’t happy at all(all laugh) what’s that brat doing now Trace(all laugh)..?’
Tracey(laugh) : “first Sceptile as usual was after him with being afraid of grass while replanting(all laugh) then he came to me said he’s afraid of my Marill(all burst into laughter)...i told him to get off from her(all laugh)..hallucinated an water vs fire stuff then said we don’t know how to be afraid(all laugh uncontrollably)...Ash how did that brat take down Zengestrong of all legends?”
Ash(laugh) : “told i see you want to attack me but you don’t have to increase my fear(all laugh) cause i’m afraid of myself(all burst into laughter)..then goes with the reasons how each possible movements he does is so apprehensive to him what to speak of others(all laugh)..this makes the legend absolutely startled that why would a brat commit suicide(all laugh)..then later legend didn’t know what to do cause anything she does tells beacuse i showed you these things her aren’t you afraid of yourself too cause of so many attacks that you have and way more than me,aren’t all your attacking moods only reflecting that you’re only afraid of your powers(all uncontrollably laugh)..reflection specialist added cause Spiritomb knows the legend is way more intelligent than normal pokebrats(all laugh) so she may think that only being afraid of herself cause of powers means Spiritomb wants self destruction mood cause he too is afraid of his powers as he showed(all laugh)..so the reflection makes sure that any smallest attack also is such and thus Spiritomb is nowhere found cause legend must be too busy with self fear alone(all laugh)..this will get a normal human being to become a philosopher(all laugh)..and this cures the legend cause she realizes that Spiritomb himself is extremely powerful and yet thinks that he only may hurt the legend thus saying all this and wants to just fool around,legend was so happy(all laugh)..then the legend had to afraid it out and the lunactic that was managing her was as usual pshyched out totally(laugh)..Spiritomb is Spiritomb you know two lines and you’re dead(all laugh)..to the enemies says i’m afraid of myself aren’t you too(all laugh)..then our reflection master used a similar trick(all laugh)..took down Flybobtisep saying your how can you wings match without water(all laugh uncontrollably)..then went to water(all laugh)..but won’t they match if they really do match so why need water(all laugh)..the legend was very angry,’yeah the you’re refecting your anger with me only that is you and your anger are reflecting each other where am i then(all laugh and .)’..you can understand this a human philospher will be stunned to hear(all laugh)..and they know what they mean mean by all these(all smile)..that’s Nivy(all laugh) cause legend being legend may try to pull the same tricks of the reflectioner himself(all laugh) so gets out of that(all laugh)..still remember Russen Rosberg,Sinnoh Elite4,hall of Fame grass gym,Gourgeist,Nivy says,’this attack and life that you’re thinking,is it you or the attack or the thought..what is the meaning of all these shoudn’t we give first a tought cause only these are disturbing our thoughts and then are we fumbling in our thoughts which only can be resolved if we thought to give them some more consideration as thought(all burst into laughter and .)’..that was enough for Gourgeist to run back inside pokeball(all laugh)..like that Kalos final you saw Nancy Charles of all people 5 pokemons in final themselves return cause of thoughts(all burst into laughter)..later she said i should give a thought to quit the profession cause of many thoughts(all burst into laughter)..second time we faced just laughed the thought off(all laugh) referee was told to just enjoy(all laugh)..yeah too much on thoughts(all laugh),of course he can’t YET do poems(all laugh) but similar stuffs..what a brat(all laugh)..anyway so the legend against Garchomp and they hallucianted reflections and all but you are one(all laugh),then became two and all,then you two should face each other then shouldn’t you(all laugh uncontrollably)..the legend finally tried odd number stuff and you realized that’s exactly why they are legends realized that any two will be a trouble,then odd numbers are told um but you won’t find any friends would you that looks exatcly like you like a friend or a beau(all burst into laughter)..that’s Heracross trick(all laugh)..finally the legend had to budge and all(all laugh)..what a bunch they are(all laugh)..anyway,so first we have to break the first psychic guard and create the dragon wall simultaneouly while some other brats hide them and simultaneous cause the two should nearabout match thus i get Claydol,Hoopa,Darkrai and Confragigus break the first wall then they are hidden by Gourgeist and Metagross and the dragon wall is Giratina,Latios,Hydreigon and Ultranercozma and Reshiram hides them actually he didn’t have to but just an extra protection the 1st wall as well only Metagross could do but Gourgeist again extra if more are needed anywhere so they are deployed outside but these guards meant none could detect them at all no matter what unless they wated to get detected(all laugh) then Yveltal is kept free to still if any outside brats come in he can control them and he is given a free role totally cause by hiding him as well we don’t want to disturb others or attract them to us by creating too strong psychic channels and this is to shield against any Ghostradarkarrigussonors(all laugh) so so those four break the first pshysic guard..then Spiritomb,Malamar and Magearna breaks the second psychic wall that alarms the reservation into battle mood where go in Reuniclas,Beeheeyem,Jellicent,Gourgeist,Uxie,Gengar,Dusknoir,Greninja,Rotom and Noivern...then Rotom you know(all laugh)..all forms are hindering his true form(all laugh) which Nivy universalizes according to age(all burst into laughet) and Greninja is the water type sentiment(all laugh) and with her extra Kalos knowledge fools the Kanto major branch(all laugh)...totally fooled the inside guard then hallucianting and all the reserve pokemons forgot everything cause they realize that Greninja,Nivy and Rotom can’t do any harm to them cause they were so much superior yet just fools around and Rotom was there exactly to show them a electric type is here with the power to match so they better play around only as well cause they can’t alarm the outside as there is also a dark dragon and Greninja as well a dark type extremely strong who knows water sentiments and then is from Kalos(all laugh) reservation has to be controlled as you know we were doing so much anyway Golduck,Jellicent,Manaphy,etc would’ve got woken so that is why they were there then the 2nd psychic wall is broken by them Spiritomb,Malamar and Magearna and then they were shielded by Marshadow only then Dusknoir and Beeheeyem forms a guard from respectively outside and inside the reservation area as in where the boundary is to stop the inside group to get out and the viseversa,they didn’t do anything with the psychic wall just stood as guard while Jellicent is standing in the reservation area to observe the procedure what is happening there and if all things are alright there or not none knows him he isn’t connected to anyone Rotom,Noivern and Greninja knows he is there to control the situation is it goes out of their hands but he won’t at all help unless the need arises and that the three has to apprise him and Jellicent is chosen cause already one exists so recruitment possibility(all laugh) and Glalie would’ve got me caught or reservation fanatic(all laugh) Jellicent could be detected cause of same type but he never battles(all laugh) so that would’ve infact helped(all laugh) then with all them the rest as well entered to control the Grass group of 3,Psychic group of 3 and electric group of 2 and then the apparatus room where we had to put the guards off cause of hidden cameras(all laugh) and actually the aparatus room guards were dozed off first then only Rotom,Noivern and Greninja entered of course(all laugh) and that reel was put off cause i beforehand knew the main switch cause Simon forced Arthur to give out the full security plan(all laugh) you will not give it to anyone in the world except him and Lance so yeah sabotage(all laugh) well or else Mist flower would've given me anyway(all laugh) during Sinnoh break Mist was exactly how she is now i told her look we're not yet officially married atleast don't give away the secrets of gym(all laugh) caught cold almost(all laugh),Ash!how can you say..(all laugh) so i had to wifesist my eternal wife again(all laugh,Ash smiles at Misty who smiles at Ash,both at same pose)..so that was taken care of and Bronzong was there of course for the HUMANS(all laugh) so that was off and Bronzong of course during out fake fight learnt everything about the gym and then actually he was at the aparatus room and then he was with Jack incognito when Simon checked it and Jack knew the plans via Dave who told him just tell Bronzong the master switch to turn off the whole CCTV stuff everywhere(all laugh) which he so happily oblidged and Simon knew it of course(all laugh) this was when i was at Pallet first time,Simon,Lance and Jack had to know that i'll break-in just the process only Dave did(all laugh) and Jack you know my cousin as well at Sinnoh and he controls the office with his lackies(all laugh) so sweet the man(all laugh) and his other half Nellie is out of profession too much starstuck(all laugh) that family just so naive(all laugh) anyway then the 2 outside Grass groups had the outside grass guard group had Reuniclas,inside grass guard group had Mismagius cause it hosted a certain Celebi(all laugh) and the the inside reservation grass group which hosted Viriz(all burst into laughter)..man this ever gets Harris son to refell on grass(all laugh) and Brenda says i've got about 100 different tunes to mean different things and then mixups(all brust into laughter) like Viriz(all burst into laughter)..and Harris son absolutely loaths me for this(all laugh) just so naive(all laugh) no really that city that gym that first feeling that first voice from Mr Slate then that corridor to gym(all laugh) and finally that MAN(all laugh) i thought gym leader what and what not(all laugh) then went and Mr Slate was no naive of course(all laugh) so got a bit of confidence then the MAN(all laugh) and i realized it's so naive(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing) any second thoughts Doctor Slate(all laugh).."
Brock(laugh) : "should've poisoned you with your wife(all laugh)"
Ash(laugh) : "so naive(all laugh) and then the inside grass group was tackled by Uxie of course for that approach(all laugh) and then the electric group had Tapu Koko(all laugh) this was outside so the outside had to have Unown(all laugh) and that brat knew Tony,Tapu Koko and Oliv psycho and her Unown too well so aww...(all laugh) anyway,then the inside guard was tackled by Meowstic and then the outside psychic had Tornadus(all laugh) so there was Gardevoir(all laugh) a deal for only the self(all laugh) then the inside guard had Jirachi so i had Musharna to talk with steel(all laugh) then finally the inside guard had MARSHADOW(all laugh) so was fed none other than Gengar(all laugh) just my Gengy(all laugh) that brat's whole life is about in pursuit of that meddening tickling(all burst into laughter) so was there and then the brat actually as usual wanted to jump on everyone(all laugh) so was scoffed off then Whimsicott,Ribombee and Aegislash is encirculating the whole gym now to catch misbehaving human or pokebrat(all laugh) and the encirculation is about dozing people off the guards that is(all laugh) that i'll explain later(all laugh)and also Beeheeyem as usual wanted to jump upon everyone inside the reservations to share Gengar's path(all laugh) we kept that brat grounded saying what's the point no path is good enough and you'll anyhow forget(all laugh) said yeah as you said none that maddening path hence only i forget(all burst into laughter) they had to stay cause if soething happened we needed extra people and not get everyone at one basket(all laugh) Dusknoir was on the outside reservation HUMANS(all laugh) and Beeheeyem was on the inside of course(all laugh) if Beeheeyem or Dusky was needed they would've actually dozed the humans off with full power means just a Ghostradarkarrigussonor(all laugh) none waking up before atleast next hour if they were like 100 in numbers(all laugh) then the 8 trainers groups that we had the inside reservation human guards were dozed by Beeheeyem and you realize when i say one brat looking after the whole reservation including humans of a hall of fame gym at which level they are at(all laugh) and Dusky did the same from outside the reservation,Aegislash did that to inside guards and then the outside brat guards were just dozed off alongside their door guard comrades by Chanedlure way before(all laugh) and still had Ribombee for the outside guards and none other than Whimsicott for door guards(all laugh),Ribombee said this sleep so important let them be that(all laugh) and Whimsicott you know(all laugh) all ideas of whim only represents the freedom of self from being(all burst into laughter) but the same if seen from the point of view of the being is so confining(all laugh) hence we should go to it's fullest(all laugh) observe how it changes then you will be free of them then if you're so or not why let them go cause only due to them do you realize the bondage and freedom of self thus are they useful or not(all burst into laughter),then the outside guard finally they were before anything dozed off by 4 dragons actually(all laugh) Giratina,Ultranercozma,Hydreigon,Latios so no comeback of course(all laugh) those brats were extremely incensed with me cause they weren't allowed inside(all laugh) each wanted to enter and if they did Mist would've herself came to my home with Violet and all the rest(all laugh) anyway,so all HUMAN brats were taken care of(all laugh),then finally Doexys is on Staryu and Starmie and Sableye then gets on my Mist flower and Banette and Chanedlure check everything then Banette comes out and tells me all clear and Chanedlure reconfirms(all laugh) i was on Dragonite and Rayquaza was beside me with Glalie and Celebi so now i tell Banette to do the subtle body transportation(all laugh)...then Banette did that subtle body transformation and now with first the dragonic wall then again the 4 at the first guard wall my subtle body can’t pass through either so now Yveltal is relieved of his role as Zekrom tells him and Yveltal and Celebi first understand my subtle body’s condition then Yveltal gets through the dragon wall and goes against my 4 dragons while Celebi goes through the first guard wall and does the same thus mitigating their effect creating a tunnel but the main wall intensity wasn’t harmed at all just a tunnel they created to get me through and thus passing me through and yet the first wall doesn’t break neither does the dragonic wall,so those two thus create a channel without disturbing anything or anyone and get me in subtle form and Banette passed through and the Banette got me through the second trap along with my Decidueye whom i released before going to the subtle state along with Zekrom and Garchomp finally and Rayquaza was hiding me till now but he can’t anymore cause he has to bind my body with Dragonite and thus they are visible to the world and in that state only by subtle body transformation is possible not if i’m already hidden to an extent so before this time Glalie and Celebi were hiding us out but now my physical body is dead and Rayquaza has to hold onto it with Dragonite at a much less height and all we three are visible to the whole world so now Garchomp and Glalie comes in our aid so that we’re not seen none of us while Zekrom was filling the Yveltal role but the risk was higher cause she has to put effort as well to keep floating is air cause it’s not natural to her like Yveltal and then after these things happen Garchomp,Glalie,Dragonite and Rayquaza goes away to the cape to find some secluded place and rest while Glalie was vigilant as to if any pests come she will hallucinate them off and you understand she was all alone in that yes Dragonite and Rayqaza was there if things happened still my body would’ve had to be brought in around the gym to actually live another day and you know no legal building can be penetrated by a pokemon attack or suspicious presence at night and we were tresspassing(all laugh) so cape was selected and then after the dragonic wall is ok Yveltal is back to his role then when i’m in Celebi is also free and all the while Garchomp was travelling to and from the gym to cape where my physical body was now Zekrom does that and Garchomp had brought Celebi so he is beside Glalie to help her out now Garchomp and Zekrom were doing the to and from Zekrom was from gym side,Garchomp my side they met mid air and was at each other’s throat as usual even then when i’m dead(all laugh) and they were there as to what was happening at both places if i was safe at both places but with Celebi now beside Glalie i was safe as to my physical body won’t be harmed but still time was a factor and my subtle body was may be 6 km away and thus Zekrom’s role was extremely crucial and Banette could only keep the subtle form for atmost maximum 70 minutes max with my help,which is a 40 minutes more than record though(laugh)...and dragons can do a bit more less or equal to 5 minutes or so(all laugh) Giti,Cozy and Lati(all laugh) and then Mist always had Starmie and Staryu with her during sleep thus Deoxys took care of those two and actually we didn't doze anyone off cause that might've harmed them or so could've got caught they could've resisted and so on big risks(all laugh) so then Sableye working on Mist to make sure she doesn’t wake up..now after i get in with Banette and Decidueye and Chanedlure shows Banette the path who blindly follows her and i’m just like a little baby all on Banette’s lap really what i actually wanted then(all laugh) still more than do but only with my sweet Mist wife now(all laugh) didn’t know anything what they were doing except i had connections with only Chanedlure and none else and this is there cause else Decidueye can’t hallucinate the world out as i’ll get hallucinated myself(all laugh) if i was in semi subtle bodies and so on i can stay out of their hallucinations for 2 minutes but in that situation no way(all laugh) and these hallucinations actually that Glalie,Jellicent,Decidueye,Garchomp and all doing are general as to they have to protect themselves in that mode of hallucination and all too many varied cause 103 contributes in the plans of these(all laugh) and then i get inside the room with Banette,Decidueye is told to guard the door being invisible and Decidueye’s type allows her to be anywhere in the gym though she cant stay afloat all time but still as a guard a great choise and you know her can scare the hell out of anybody and we had Violet the room beside(all laugh) and that much emotion(all laugh) anyway then i roamed i roamed around inside like 3 minutes to see the whole place and Mist of course(all laugh) i had connection with Chaneldure i told her to tell Marshadow to tell Metagross to tell Zekrom to tell Garchomp to lead the way for us four to be there at the gym which takes place as Garchomp carried Celebi and Glalie who hallucinated all us 3 and that is phenomenal cause pokemons were managing pokemons and all knew each other so well none affected none and so on(all laugh) and then i’m brought in and now the real game starts cause physical body can’t get thorugh the guards unless the wall is mitigated and the inside and outside guards has to be forced to let me in which was strictly prohibited that day(all laugh) and  extra guards were called in by my sweet Mist flower(all laugh)..and Violet wanted police protection as well which the HUMAN himself advised her to not do cause whole world will now pester Mist even more and that will not be very well received by she herself in that condition(all laugh) Viol how could you not let my Ash.um..Mr Sweet Idiot Ketchum..um..that namecall break-in(all laugh) then i was showing Banette how to open the door of course(all laugh) and then they say your body is brought in all clear then i get out of the room again and show them the guards and the door and Decidueye is now hallucinating the guards with Glalie who is finally brought inside after 7 years(all laugh) and these two pests were hallucinating everyone and i was directing them and also Chaneldure was connected to me and i kept informing her my position and she the outside and everyone there as usual i only had connection with her and that brat was even then telling me make the emotions pure(all burst into laughter) i told her shut up or you will be sent back to your former home,’you go(all burst into laughter),Girlfriend doesn’t live there(all burst into laughter),are you here for girfriend(all burst into laughter)’ then i chided the pest saying unless you shut up you will not get girlfriend(all burst into laughter) and Chanedlure is told to communicate with whole gym except anyone at reservation barring Dusknoir who was at the outside reservation guard and Beeheeyem was inside they two had interconnections only in-between none else knew anything then my 2nd wall guard Marshadow and 1st wall guard Metagross had connection and all outsiders were interconnected except Yveltal who was totally free just observing the process being happy(all laugh) well Zekrom each time fought with him as well(all laugh) and then Chaneldure had connection with Marshadow thus the inside and outside is known Chanedlure did the central communication and she being ghost-fire was a strange choise in water hall of fame gym(all laugh) so less chance of getting caught by pokemons(all laugh) anyway then the guards are lost at dark Kalos library lawns(all laugh) that was Gengleye special(all laugh) and yeah Banette too was there as was everyone,Decidueye multiple times that pest has scared many people(all laugh) and Celebi was doing that to outside guards,while Zekrom and Garchomp did the Yveltal role and Yveltal was protecting Dragonite and Rayquaza too helped,Dragonite held my body..so made sure guards from both inside and outside are disturbed enough for me to speak in their heads to compel them to open the door(all laugh) all ghostly means(all laugh) and then of all Rayquaza came in with my body(all laugh) and Yveltal(all burst into laughter) Yveltal in a water gym is a hard thing(all laugh) that brat says why are you trying to be not serious again while you’ve become serious first(all burst into laughter) cause when you wasn’t still you were trying to be serious doesn’t life pass in this unhappy circle(all burst into laughter) i said why are you inside(all laugh),’Dragonite said girlfriend evolvs(all burst into laughter) to be unhappy(all burst into laughter)’ i told the brat to shut the hell up(all laugh) then Rayqaza of course(all laugh) and that pest was trying to jump onto the gym(all laugh) i told him you need to hide Dragonite,’has he evolved(all burst into laughter),the Dragonic manual says to be a dragon one must understand the difference between flame blast and Dragonite(all burst into laughter) is Palkia a dragon cause he says he doesn’t know a dragon(all burst into laughter) does girlfriend know how to enter a volcano like a dragon that is to understand Heatran methods like swimming(all burst into laughter) and doing the opposite(all laugh) what does your manual say of being seriously dragon(all burst into laughter)’ i just told the pest to shut the hell up and now Chaneldure again comes to lead the path and Banette was hosting me with Decidueye protecting us and Glalie and Celebi now was on inside guards while Rayquaza went onto work on outside guards and you know he can be anywhere a psudeo-legend sky serpent mega evolved max(all laugh) in lunacy that is(all laugh) according to dragonic manuals that’s most normal(all laugh) and then Yveltal was booted out of the gym else Rayquaza was trying to go to reservation this pest wanted to enter Mist’s room to teach her path to unhappy recovery(all burst into laughter) anyway i send the brat off to protect Dragonite who said this is 2nd devolutionary stage of Charizard cause master brat is not very serious like Bulbasaur(all burst into laughter) Charizard is serious in breeding season isn’t he unhappy then Yveltal(all burst into laughter) trying to be happy with another making her unhappy of happy if both happy why are they together(all burst into laughter) yeah like Latios and Latias doesn’t evolve why(all burst into laughter) anyway these pests are scoffed off and then i get to the outside of the room where my physical body was carried by Banette as well then Decidueye hides us and Chaneldure keeps guard while i get into physical body and then i tell Chanedlure to return to encircle the gym and be the communication centre as she was doing before and Yveltal is back to his role and Dragonite with Zekrom and Garchomp were sent back to the Cape where they were but Garchomp and Zekrom were doing the rounds but only sometimes and only one was doing while the other protected Dragonite and then Decidueye were kept at door and Banette after i get into physical body consious and alritght goes in opens the door and i jump on my Mist flower finally(all laugh) then she looked as i said too skinny and all then i saw eveything in her room a few diaries i took and samples of her doses,Banette was beside me all time reminind me to be at present(all laugh) and you understand how important that was there and hence that brat was chosen cause Dusknoir would’ve irritated me(all laugh) and then Sableye was unhappy that he wasn’t tickling Mist(all laugh) and Deoxys said if your bodies change who are you(all burst into laughter) the present(all burst into laughter) cause it doesn’t change(all burst into laughter) i asked Banette do you know philosophy(all laugh),’substandard(all brust into laughter) cause i know all these three mere kids alwasy at past with you or future(all laugh) are you past master brat(all burst into laughter)’ then i chided the pests and then Chanedlure told me Jellicent is saying to Beeheeyem who by Dusknoir was telling her if he can know these pests cause he was getting serious by observing the poor state of the art of these poor kids by getting sad(all burst into laughter) i said told that brat to shut up or i will recall him,’you go inside pokeball(all burst into laughter) are you free though being serious(all burst into laughter)’..i told those pests to shut up and went on with my work there all the keys and everything for door etc were opened by my sweet flower when she was like the guards first was called up didn’t see us we were hidden then was made dizzy then this was after Banette did the full subtle body transplantation again and Sableye was on her and Decidueye was zapped in before by Banette and then she was hiding my physical body Mist herself opened each lock(all laugh)..right(all laugh),then was back to sleep(all laugh),so sweet my sweet Mist flower(all laugh,Ash hugs Misty quickly and Misty smiles at Ash same pose) then i saw diaries which Mist started to write only after we broke-up(all laugh) then brief entries only 4 were there and the other had those stuffs and psychic things written and learnt the doses from a few other places and wrote them down then by then due to subtle body and all i understood her condition of mind was very bad but these made me understand fully how much pain i had put my sweeite...fine(all laugh),how much pain my sweet flower was in and then i tendered her head a bit then went to read the diaries very brief saw them all pages had my name(all laugh) i was appearing each night and so on(all laugh) then i woke her up and she wakes up and sees me was stunned but couldn’t say anything then i tell her that,she was half dizzy gagged and bounded by rubber tapes(all laugh) then she was so sweetly sitting on my lap no attempt to resist or to not listen(all laugh) and first 2 minutes was trying to resist then just settled down and by the end of that 10/15 minutes didn’t want to leave my lap at all(all laugh) wanted to be there listening my voice no matter what i was saying or her condition and situation just wanted to be with her Ash and i knew this sweet Gyarados is my soulmate indeed(all laugh) my Ash was back and no matter what he did he’s only my Ash(all laugh) the she was put to sleep again and dozed off and then those diaries were kept intact and the psychic stuff written that i took with me and she had a few black dresses(all laugh) and the one used that day on gym all were torn apart and scattered on the floor to tell her get rid of the mess and then she was finally dozed off for the next 3/4 hours by Sableye then i get out of the room with Deoxys having dozed off Staryu and Starmie and Banette took me to reservation and there similarly Deoxys and Decidueye disturbed the guarding brats with Dusknoir of course now only on the guard brats(all laugh) and Sableye hid my physical body while by similar process via Banette i disturbed them(all laugh) but then inside there was none other than Gengar(all laugh) that brat told Sableye why are you serious(all burst into laughter) Sableye said atleast you got to tickle them in their head and atleast they are pokemons(all laugh) i was fed a choised not pokemon brat(all laugh) who didn’t know who she is in-between what state so that to tickle herself back into the present time exact exactly not doing what she was seriously serious(all burst into laughter),Gengar said yeah i’m serious but not by so(all laugh) mere kids thus the first teaching in life for little kids is to tickle themselves while they are sad(all burst into laughter) only if they look good(all burst into laughter) master brat did that brat look good(all burst into laughter) i said you shut up and then entered reservation and now changes were needed more throughly so now i have Deoxys,Decidueye and Sableye free so i told Deoxys to help Beeheeyem so the guards now were totally out cold(all laugh) then Sableye i told help Dusknoir thus that was settled and Decidueye was sent to help Aegislash cause now with Aegislash was inside private are and Decidueye was out so none would get in or out(all laugh)and why i only let Chaneldure doing the rounds that is she was encirling the gym that was cause the gym i didn’t care outside brats could do whatever they wanted cause none from inside was going to respond cause Aegislash was roaming around here at the border only(all laugh) would've dozed each pokebrat off(all laugh) and then still had Decidueye who would've jumped Violet first(all laugh) so none from outside could enter just due to suspicion and if they really caught us still Decidueye would've created the inside guard and Aegislash the outside then i would've sent Banette as well so no hope(all laugh) and none of the guarding pokemons could do one thing(all laugh) and Chaneldure as i said only one communication centre and a free role for same reason i didn’t care about any brats cause they weren’t as good as Mist atleast(all laugh) and their pokebrats wouldn’t have caught any of us anyway(all laugh) the only trouble was Viol with Mantine but if she saw Decidueye that day she would've required treatment(all laugh) well i had to actually come out of incognito and say Mist is just my wife so a Ketchum(all laugh) anyway,and then i entered reservation and then by smiliar process all doors before and now were locked in as well(all laugh) and then Banette was ferried off to free up Rayquaza to fetch Dragonite and the two opposing dragons who were incensed with me why always they are specifically chosen to collaborate in-between which Darkrai says not possible exactly at all(all burst into laughter) and Dragonite took Garchomp’s side cause Zekrom doesn’t evolve(all burst into laughter) and Zekrom took Dragonite’s side cause she doesn’t evolve(all burst into laughter) anyway Dragonite had a hard time as did Yveltal even more cause he was unable to help the world in pursuit of happiness(all laugh) then that goes and Jellicent was there with me still disconnected and my three brats were there but now they stopped and Golduck,Jellicent,Poliwrath,Carracosta,Tapu Fini,Kaledo etc sees me and jumps onto me(all laugh) and yeah before all Noivern,Rotom and Greninja sat with me in subtle body during preparation as did all else and i shared Mist’s codes as much as i could recall cause i knew her as me(all laugh) and so on and only my bunch can make you believe that that they know the trainer so well cause they have fondled so many brats their connection were broken and so on they just know everything about human-pokemon interaction to a very high level but now too dangerous cause legendary rules have been known and that termination fear has got them bossy now(all laugh) they try to befriend humans as well(all laugh) that is very dangerous stuff(all laugh) then i understood Godluck and Jellicent and all especially Golduck cause he was relieved to see me and he doubted Noivern but realized he had no ill intention at all and Greninja really helped with Kalos wisdom(all laugh) and Rotom made sure all understands the plight of having a form(all laugh) and then Jellicent wasn’t much used till recent then so was alright but Golduck had burnt the full blow and only his heightened level could take that much emotion that too HUMAN(all laugh) and then i realized they needed pokecentre and Trace(all laugh) cause they needed to practise of course(all laugh) then i similarly came out and went dragon travel and was at Platue in about an hour(all laugh) then well i came to the gym at 12:45 left at 5:30 it was morning then(all laugh) and that was something by itself cause morning means more risk(all laugh) but none came to save themselves cause Yveltal,Garchomp,Zekrom and Glalie and were there in 4 places(all laugh) and Celebi came inside to cover the Brauchy man(all burst into laughter) and Sarah woman(all laugh) so they were inactive and then Hana sis was dozed off before by Banette when i went out actually(all laugh) and sweet sweet Vickie lad was with Brawn whole night(all laugh) anyway then i was out of gym by similar means and then dragon travel,then was at Platue and there after that slept from 8:00- 11:00 in front of Lance’s office(all laugh) and the place was on fire(all laugh) and Lance was saying all are hunting you(all laugh) i said let them no clue then told him my methods and he said yeah i’m so happy my son-in-law is out of profession(all laugh) then actually my bunch and the fool around nature only could do so much anything else you fumble becoming serious or dishonest leading to seriousness that is(all laugh) and get caught(all laugh) none were serious at any time and that’s why they told all at the end that it’s just fun(all laugh) and then i take lunch there call the greatest boss impersonally(all laugh) told him yeah my brats can work independently as you opined that they would be given a chance as i asked him before this break-in(all laugh) just that assurence was big and he was laughing saying wrong philosophy for me you see(all laugh) i said yeah but aren't there pokemons(all laugh) said substandard(all laugh) doesn't know what's muthopromo-tyrobthanlop-hatugusap-inirocrystrum-genedicised-pryrobolic psychic thunder(all laugh) that type of swelled Gerizentromastrotarf that is(all laugh) i said understood(all laugh) then asked Lance why such people after winning first league at 18 goes the wrong way,he said just checked you first next term reversal and both jovial i'm entering too with Simon just that bash(all laugh) i said yeah will try to get 214 then(all laugh) then was there almost whole day,the brats were sent to Mr Oak Mr Oak before i slept so they were there at lab before break-in news broke(all laugh) actually the whole gym only woke up at 8(all laugh) then returned home at night mom didn't know,my farm was empty none were there was at Platue of course(all laugh) whole night that is(all laugh) the flight was on the same night(all laugh) then returned next day only(all laugh) and i went to Safforn and then Dave knew those stuffs and then told me a bit and inquired and all then returned here no clue of them cause the whole group was at Kanto Elite4 HQ only(all laugh) then i next day go to farm and the set up stuff none bothered about cause the very brats were only at lab(all laugh) and that night Gallade was at Dr Skechit's room and Grumpig at Mr Oak's room with Mr Oak(all laugh) and Professor hosted Noivern(all laugh) anyway then i returned here and was at the farm and all that and mom was suspicious(all laugh) then the break-in all knew mom was so happy(all laugh) i said why bother she is independent how do anyone know what's in her mind(all laugh) where only my Ash is there in the personal life box forever(all laugh,Ash and Misty smile at each other in same pose) then a few brats asked me and was jumping up and down i said first and last,where's proof(all laugh),then Tony boy and Braumy manual jumped me(all laugh) you dozed our brats off last night WHO GIVES YOU PERMISSON(all laugh) i said a certain person who is electrified while dealing with flying types(all laugh) then Braumy manual cut off saying yeah ALWAYS DRAGS HER CAUSE THAT'S THE MANUAL(all laugh) which says Tony see this brat(all laugh) and for seeing me it was left to thus of all people Tony boy(all laugh) so Tony boy was extremely grave saying this is crossing of that type of line(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) i said give the phone to her(all laugh),HOW DARE YOU..(all laugh),think my wife is professionally independent of me(all laugh) then was grave said,man are you marrying that Gyarados or not(all laugh) i said well you'll know who my wife is at the right time bye(all laugh) then Harris son called me saying my Celebi and Viriz..i mean Virizion(all laugh) are too happy what did you do(all laugh) i said well they were shown the way to that maddening tune(all laugh) DON'T SPOIL MYY BUNCH(all laugh) and cut off(all laugh) i said why don't you do(all laugh) yeah yeah,too happy marry that Gyarados and get the hell out of Cerulian,bye(all laugh) then Olivia i told and Irene too that invited the Gyarados but didn't say barely managing to not abduct her to begin with(all laugh),Kane darling called and said AREN'T YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE CONCEPT OF DATING(all burst into laughter) i said that's against Huntelion(all laugh) yeah,go there with your eternally married Gyarados and don't return again(all laugh) then Mr Oak Mr Oak calls and then i met him there as well he was the safety valve of the family(all laugh) which he still is that is(all laugh) says,um..they are rather incensed you see,i said yeah for your concern Gary,this and this type was this and that not of that type(all laugh) said yeah was a bet with Trace that this must be of that type(all laugh) but he didn't accept the bet(all laugh) too serious(all laugh) i said yeah let him get cooked by the Daisyl(all laugh) then Lillie was told it's professionalism(all laugh) who was so dejected,angry and sad all at same time fodled the hell out of Chu of all brats(all laugh) just so naive(all laugh) Chu was dictating her pace as usual(all laugh) told me only waiting to jump you all of these brats while I starve for girlfriend not fare at all(all burst into laughter) i said yeah you know life is hard(all laugh) said too much i see(all laugh) no brats ever can be happy unless they know the opposite which is another hence you will never be happy not alone(all laugh) i said don't curse me(all laugh),is that girlfriend's beau(all burst into laughter) i just scoffed that brat off(all laugh) then Zara was extremely busy as you know(all laugh) and other people from Sinnoh were here and all,all so naive(all laugh) and then on the other hand next morning Mist gravely comes out at 11 of course(all laugh) and hands Viol the note she goes nuts(all laugh) and Doctor Slate was hellbent to call the police complaining that FEELING(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs) then Mr Oak Mr Oak is called the answer is yeah the subtle bodies are not of that type(all burst into laughter) and Trace solemly points out hence you won’t find one clue cause this is done by HUMANS(all uncontrollably laugh) then Lillie cries to Mr Oak Mr Oak saying why that brat CHOSE us(all laugh) answer is yeah that type of choise(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) and Daisy said involve the general govenment(all laugh) exactly for which Zara was here(all laugh) that FEELING(all laugh) and Violet didn’t know where she is but seriously(all laugh) all of you got Mist out of depression actually cause she realized she has to babysit her sisters and Doctor Slate(all laugh) and the jackal was neutrally with them(all laugh) and the only help Mr Oak Mr Oak provides is on that type(all laugh) Mist later told me and i realized just so naive(all laugh) anyway,then she called her friends and all and the whole world comes to know via Viol and Sarah and Lance is pestered by the whole world who says Mr Oak told Mr Oak knows it’s just that type(all laugh) hopefully police didn’t find anything else they would’ve been resent to law by none other than my sweet Mist flower(all laugh) who was so happy in subconscious that my Ash likes me(all laugh)...right(all laugh),then Mist calls all throws a party without a party(all laugh) 4 guardians with their soulmates swing around(all laugh) and Tony boy and Braumy manual was incensed with their brats how could they be dozed off and how i got the permission(all laugh) Olivia told them are you two back to teenage(all laugh) and Harris son all along said he's after my Virizion since day one i knew(all laugh) and then hubby and travel compnion were bouncing with Olivia cause she told about the note(all laugh) and shrew wisely notes with aversion just the starter(all burst into laughter) then May is all over the place and confirms Mist that that was indeed proposal(all laugh) the timespan was right but not costly(all burst into laughter) then Max was informed who said,um Mia should we..(all burst into laughter)’ to which that little pest said yeah we have more pokemons(all burst into laughter) Brawn said,hence it's called the late night bash,yay!(all burst into laughter) then Foster was told(all burst into laughter) who said yeah but um Gary what was that type(all laugh) then of all people lady Dawn had to be there(all laugh) who by then had womaned up being 25(all laugh) then i didn’t have any contacts with her after Unova so it was 4 years and last spoke with Mist 6 years ago while still at Hoenn and a too much more ladied up teenager(all laugh),she heard that came to the gym cause it was huge news and she knew the Sinnoh and Unova contrasting versions of us first hand(all laugh) and so was here Mist greeted her she said it’s just your bee as ever that makes you always too flowered up(all laugh) and she didn’t know about the note just the break-in,Mist said kinda defended himself(all laugh) and Dawn said yeah,conscience i guess of Gengar(all laugh) anyway,then of all the more people senor called(all laugh) and Mist fell from sky when she said always so brotherly with the other gender(all burst into laughter) cause Mist thought with her long and deep dejection and still the strange joy only senor had similar sort of feelings then(all laugh) and then the beautiful men a bit less though(all laugh) is so happy that the battle took place and they knew what i was upto(all laugh) they directly called the gym(all laugh) were relieved actually(all laugh) and then Mist flower decided she will to jump into ocean with 4 pokemons but mind it not with Azumarill(all laugh) cause she is HUMAN(all laugh) and then mom wasn’t informed by me directly else i would’ve had hard time at home cause that meant i’ve married Mist and not letting her come at home(all laugh) thus didn’t stay at home except 2 days(all laugh) and then i was at home and hear stories and Dave was told everything says yeah i’m dissapointed that Zara is out of profession(all laugh) i said still long way to go cause may be it’s(all laugh)..ok,ok(all laugh),yeah i was going with blood and sweat during our date and Mist was then still opposing me and then i said that immediately profusely sobbs but if she wasn’t my eternal wife it would’ve been thrown back to me exactly why i served it to her(all laugh) then says i’ll show you i’ll marry(all laugh)...right(all laugh),then i say just for me(all laugh) again returns and tries to sit on my head(all laugh) then whole world was at the gathering and Mr Oak wasn’t as Mr Oak was intentionally delayed by Giraora and many more led by none other that brat Whimsicott(all laugh) who said this idea of flickering emotions so varying Mr Oak thus it drags you around and you're never satisfied being you(all burst into laughter) hence Mr Oak why are you in rush(all burst into laughter) and 50 pokemons outside my bunch were misbehaving being ethically lectured on revolutions of between the lines and actions with the right meanings(all laugh) and the jackal was sent off by me cause i said i have special mind the word NECESSITY with Mr Oak as Mr Oak was hellbent to know the type of my process(all laugh) then i was absent feeding him to my brats and he realized the trick still couldn’t help cause outside gorups were extremely agitated and of course that is Magmortgolem agitated all your bunches even Scyther and Venonat this time too Marill doesn’t understand anything(all laugh) and so Mr Oak Mr Oak couldn’t help despite knowing everything about that type of counter(all laugh) so went there too late too knackered too ill-prepared with dresses(all laugh) and chided by everyone including Trace for the first time who politely told him this is that type of time(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) just so naive(all laugh) rather Mist defended him and Mr Oak Mr Oak in alibie said yeah that type of skirmish(all laugh) and then Doctor Slate was unstable(all laugh) cause he wasn’t naive(all laugh) and the few of Mist’s friends were here they were too happy infact cause they were 8 gurdians and a few more who knew my endeavours too well(all laugh) certainly Olivia was too happy and Irene was bouncing around(all laugh) and most beautiful saloons were to their utmost digust informed of this this time cause the mutual group was too excited(all laugh) and they said this is exactly why G is only for Gengar(all burst into laughter) and they wisely told Saul this is called the art of Palkian lie detecting(all burst into laughter) Saul knows everything about Viridian Lake(all laugh) and then Saul said somehow managed not to come to the gym despite being fed to Salamences for their insights and forsights on my career(all burst into laughter) and then that party was too moist(all laugh) and..anyway(all burst into laughter),then finally Daisy and Lillie returns and fondles my exact psychics to death(all laugh) while scoffing at me(all laugh) and the jackal wisely says just that age(all burst into laughter),Mr Oak as Gary Oak says yeah he must shift his bunch but again as Mr Oak says that psychic body type Mr Oak was not of that type(all laugh) then i was roaming around floating farm newes and swearing everyone off to get deal after deal done by sources to clear the path to get 6150 arcs(all laugh) and nowhere i was present(all laugh) cause i was using Reshi this time with the obvious Giti and Cozy(all laugh) and Beehee took Giti’s place to tell Mr Oak that Mr Oak didn’t you forget to say this on the last answer to Zeru(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) well Beeheeyem too can do momentary analysis but forgets(all laugh) thus proving more questions to Zeraora(all laugh) then the only serious thing was those stuffs and that is why i had to prepare real seriously cause i knew what i was going to do to my wife to marry her once more so she needed to be healthy enough to not be able to move hence only in my arms(all laugh)that goes and then the rest...”
............................................................................................................................................................
...Marshadow is chosen cause he went upto the reservation outside so knows all BUT he doesn’t know inside so that he doesn’t think about the inside and get panicked and rush cause they all know i’m dead and have 55 minutes in their way..so Marshadow fools the guards by sending them to dark library lawns in Kalos..yep the Gengleye’s wisdom and that’s why they fool around with each other and outside of group pokemons all the time nonstop- my whole bunch so much does that to learn and only among themselves share these tricks the skirmishes are their natural instincts being pokemons they can’t control that...so the guards are disturbed enough to check everything by opening the doors and all when Hoopa,Aegislash and Reuniclas are at the door with my body hallucinating the outside guards and getting me in via the doors but Reuniclas stays there to keep control over the outside guards while Marshadow takes care of the inside guards and till now i’ve not mentioned Malamar who was outside with Hoopa and all is now entering with my dead body alongside Hoopa and Aegislash so that she’ll now haunt around the whole gym alongside Musharna to keep track of all people and all as an extra guard and Giratina is kept outside to keep off pests while shielding herself as well...only one cause more than that will attract the pests themselves if they catch psychic channels somehow so all my psychic channels throughout the gym inside and out are just thin enough to not disturb the inside pokemons or outside pests and yet get the job done...now Aegislash shows the way hallucinating all,Hoopa carries the body then me and Gengar go out and now Hoopa and Aegislash is hallucinating all while Gengar is retransplanting me into my physical body again which after is done and i’m in full cognition,Hoopa is ferried off to the reservation now if any help is necessary and silently stands behind Nivy and all without connecting to them or Beehyem inside just standing invisible and observing everything,if he feels things are necessary then he’ll help...the necessity will only arise if he sees certain physical movements in my 3 playing in reservation,which are their signals that all my bunch has as a secret in case they can’t communicate via psychic medium or i’m not there.Chanedlure now as my physical body is no more there can hide Bulbasaur,Charizard and Talonflame now completely who were till now only at a high altitude and pretty far away but will now come just above the Gym and Chanedlure is also there to stay as a backup to Giratina and the forur dragons and my outside wall soldiers but he has no connection to anyone who doesn’t even know that they have Chanedlure as a backup neither does my inside bunch including me that what is Chanedlure doing now,Giratina has connection to Bulbasaur so if she tells Bulbasaur that she needs help send Talonflame,then instead of Talonflame it will be Chanedlure and if the four guards and four dragons need help they are told they don’t have that luxary so they must be put but Chanedlure is there without there knowledge,the 8 there has connection to Bulbasaur who if needed will send Chanedlure to wherever necessary according to the reports he’s given and then only Chanedlure will connect with all outside...my outside bunch has no idea what’s inside and viseversa and even i don’t have any clue what’s happening outside or even inside except reservation,i don’t even know what’s Aegislash doing who will have the responsibility to guard the door once i’m in in cognizing physical body who also doesn’t know the inside.none in my reservation has any link to anyone except me and Bulbasaur has no connection to Chanedlure either by psychic channels just mutual communication ensures their understanding...now,Gengar goes inside opens the door which i taught him how to while in the room and then i get in Aegislash stays at the room door and Gengar now beside me as my henchman(laugh)...
so just imagine this scenario now,
Reshiram,Latios,Hydreigon and Ultranercozma creats a all dragon dark-psychic mask outside the gym to keep the whole gym out of the whole world’s reach but they can’t help others while if pests were there while my body was dead or even after when i’m dating my Mist(laugh).Bulbasaur is on Charizard telling everyone outside to stay alert and this job inside is done by Gengar while he’s free beside me now except the inside reservation.Giratina is in fight mood but not doing anything to disturb any outside pest enough so that they jump onto us and is all alone cause another with her is trouble...Talonflame is silently waiting around Charizard to protect Bulbasaur from falling and also as a backup...now,outside wall,Deoxys,Conregigas,Spiritomb and Bronzong outside wall and Hoopa is hiding my 2 fliers and Bulbasaur waiting for Bulbasaur’s verbal command if any help if necessary outside...
the connections outside are
the first wall soldiers has connections to themselves and only Bulbasaur
Giratina too only Bulbasaur
4 dragons themselves and only Bulbasaur
Charizard has only Talonflame and viseversa...yes this is my bunch’s uniqueness though Charizard and Talonflame aren’t physhic or can use any such attacks they can still contact among themselves but not outside my bunch like that and of course they can contact me.but this is as i said only for connection and communication and nothing else,not an attack or an advantage over your opponent just inter-military communication of high level.
Chanedlure has no connection to anyone only hiding the 2 fliers and Bulbasaur.Dragonite,Talonflame and Chanedlure are mutually contacted by Bulbasaur.
Now inside-Mismagius,Unwon,Darkrai in second and only three not four cause first my subtle body won’t pass through if they are 4 second 4 means the guards will wake up as will the reservation in battle mood cause the apparatus will alarm which the first wall doesn’t cause it’s stronger and thus 4 can be deployed while just about not making the aparatus go into red alert mood..all risks but has to be done...now,Nivy,Rotom and Greninja playing in reservation with Hoopa standing behind them without any coonection to anyone and just observing the procedures inside and that of Beehyem while Dusknoir and Beehyeem creates a guard at the reservation door from two way communication and Marshadow on the inside guards and Reuniclas is on outside guards at the door but reservation guards are left untouched cause we don’t want to alarm them so that the reservation can be alarmed and now Malmar and Musharna is haunting the whole gym to catch any pokebrat misbehaving and immediately put him in sleep ONLY IF they are outside reservation as well as controlling the humans who are general or the reservation guards themselves.the reservation pokemons doesn’t know a thing except that i’ve come cause i only know what’s happening there via Nivy and even if Goldy and Jellicent catches that channel they will still get only me though it’ll be very hard for them to do cause i’m totally inactive and has no control over Nivy,who only will connect me he he feels that something isn’t right about reservation pokemons,then i will send Gengar there when i was there in physical body BUT this channel Nivy will cut off once i tell him now Mist is awake cause i will need full attention on my flower cause she is already is a dreadful mental state will all happening and then will see me suddenly and will surely know that i have in that room itself may be my whole ghost brigade and so i must stay alert.Nivy will be told to not worry but that i have Gengar with me so my physical death is not his responsibility and he should only focus on his job at hand keeping Goldy and all calm and remember his physical alarms cause Hoopa is behind him but not to try to connect to him cause Hoopa will refuse it and this endeavour itself will get Nivy in trouble if caught and that now he has to manage the whole reservation without any help from me and Hoopa helps only when the reservation isn’t behaving properly and Nivy and Hoopa both know what to do in such cases to control them and only then will Hoopa help.when i was in subtle body i had connections to none except Gengar who was holding me as because of the transplantation and all i would be dead for a few moments and my bunch inside will start to panic cause they know this thing and force Gengar to say what is happening if it takes me more time than normal to get back to full cognition but this luxary of answering them Gengar can’t afford but if not done they will turn on Gengar so i desisted till in full cognition at physical body.now,the whole world outside does know everything except that i’ve come(laugh)...Sableye is on Mist,Gardevoir is on Starew and Starmie...i’m walking around Mist’s room alongside Gengar as my ultimate protection in case i get caught out by say Ghostradarkarrigussonor herd(laugh) or humans(laugh) and i’m seeing what i want to see and all and those stuffs i took a few samples and a few diaries i took away too where certain psychic things were written which was what made Mist’s situation way worse..yeah to suppliment those even more via her psychic pokemons and all just so that se can forget me completely,but um..you know i must tell you about a thing and this is very serious but as i ever say Xormnuhs are coming tomorrow(laugh) so saying,if say just by some means Mist is too depressed as i’m no more and all then if she restarts those then the ultimate end which i told her the day of hellrounds is that she’ll think that anyone is her Ash and will want to fondle them going totally lunatic..5/6 months away from that she was and her outside activities would’ve kept you off cause those intoxications are so maddening that she’ll show impossible intelligence to keep hindrences off yet increasing the doses.....but as soon as ‘my Ash’ comes up..all erased instantly...(all smile,Ash quickly hugs Misty and tenders her head,Misty hugs Ash very firmly and smiles at him)..yeah from that position you saw how she greeted you all in the party and else cause those stuffs were only mental and as soon as i fool around with her she in her subconsious gets so happy that the effects are off instantly and also because she as you all know has iron nerves herself,just that because she has got me 15 years back to be with her consistently and it’s still raw in her the yearning and thus before the next one year,either my concrete memories like her ring or i myself have to be with her all the time(all smile)...just i’m a part of her to make my Mist full(all smile,Ash and Misty smile at each other as Misty keeps hugging Ash very firmly and Ash continues to tender her)..not Misty though(all laugh)..and the ring was hence fetched that night but what a night(all laugh)...
so now the inside,
Mismagius,Unown and Darkrai has interconnections and connections to Malmar only,who will be sent there if they feel so,this is to keep any human who are not guards and doesn’t have pokemons but with the aparatus or others from misbehaving and trying to mingle with the 2nd wall aparatus.
Musharna has connections to Reuniclas and Marshadow only who are interconnected and only connected to Musharna,this to keep off all guards and pokepests(all laugh) from misbehaving.so they take care off all guards who has pokemons including the reservation guards
Gengar who is now being ferried off to control the whole gym if anywhere any extra help is necessary for which he connects with all excluding the reservation and the reservation door psychic guards who are disconnected from the whole world except for themselves...Gengar is off as i’m now going to fully focus on Mist and also Gengar will look after any other humans like Sarah and Brauch(all laugh) from misbehaving(all laugh)...Aegislash have connection to Gengar only he is invisible outside Mist’s room as ultimate protection if anyone appears there they will have to appease his demands that why he is a ghost too and not fully steel and viseversa(all burst into laughter)...great guard indeed(all laugh)...anyway,so then finally my Mist woke up my Sableye disturbed her enough and was totally shocked to see me,then i gag her while she was in cognition but couldn’t move due to Sableye and sweetly bind her up with rubber tapes(laugh)..she was so so sweet then i hardly resisted from hugging her to deat there(all smile,Ash hugs Misty very firmly smiling at her,Misty same pose smiles at Ash)..and my cute little Mist doll was so sweetly sitting on my lap resting herself against me in normal cognition,Sableye was just making sure she was dizzy a bit but by the end of those 10/15 minutes just wanted to be like that for eternity and i knew my flower in her subconscious is all about ‘my Ash’,and thus surely is my soulmate confirming my times with the picture and then Kalos...then i told the words and all then she slept off again cause of the strain and Sableye dozed her off for atmost absolute 2.5 hours next,which is around 1 hour 25 minutes more than record as well with Team Rocket’s Mewtwo(laugh) and then i went into reservation and Goldy of course knew Nivy cause both shared the codes of me and Mist,thus Goldy knew that he’s not a stranger atleast knows Mist pretty well and Nivy never saw Mist before,Picked up by all that saw her before and knew Goldy through and through...only Goldy and Starmie could know that not others in Mist’s bunch...so i get into reservation to assure them who we are but had to hug Goldy myself and tell him don’t create a trouble you know me well..Goldy was all too happy and didn’t seem to understand what has happened at all but was suspicious cause the 3 zapped in but i said like surprize so somehow managed..Glalie wasn’t there cause she knows things too well for all to start fooling around too much to wake the guards up plus they all don’t know why exactly Glalie was shifted so abruptly in the first place plus her powers are now infinitely beyond Goldy the most powerful,who was way more powerful than Glalie when she was there so he now may think that my intensions weren’t good cause he might suspect infighting was being tried at via familiarity no matter what Glalie did plus Dewgong of all was there who only listens to Starmie and Goldy plus lastly and most heinously 3 hours with Glalie and the gym might’ve become too Crawdauntogated by now(all laugh)..Glalie’s powers are because of my bunch but Goldy is desperate to get in(all laugh)..but not succeding to do so despite Greninja being here cause Mist is chiding him everyday 4 times(all laugh)..Genrjinja is among the most polites of my bunch(all laugh) and Kalos wisdom is only used if she sees someone is trying to battle her or she is told or has felt that she must fool around otherwise the wisdom is not expressed much which is why she was here(all laugh) and also because she can control the once ever wisdom brat(all laugh) and his once only mentor Dark Cerulian master(all laugh) and Sableye is kept down by Chu mush to his disgust VIA food sharing,which of course Sableye can’t take(all laugh)..but it has to be given and it is returned to us(all laugh) for Chu’s extra meal cause he’s given less and then shares that with the brat and then the same amount has to be reimsurshed with fondling but also chiding from his new master Mist Ketchum that he’ll get unfit if eats too much(all laugh)..by the way i only enter the reservation once and stay there for 30 minutes else they’re done cause Goldy is only lurking for me to be there for longer(all laugh)..and finally to our real apprehension 4 days back suddenly i saw of all Gyarados is too interested in me(all burst into laughter and .)...yeah 15 years pays off(all laugh)..i told the brat to immediately get off(all laugh)..she has finally picked up that her natural rage must immediately be exactly upended(all burst into laughter) and i’m the obvious devil she knows(all laugh)..and she is also spoiling her beau(all burst into laughter),who is another gem himself with that size(all laugh)..hard times really(all laugh)..well while talking to Goldy,i was alone in reservation with Nivy rest was all now hallucinating the whole gym and all,then i myself came out again by the roof doors where Gengar took me and then i showed him how to close it as i did in Mist’s room and only my bunch could pick that up so so quickly and reproduce the same so quickly and so perfectly that too the psychic bunch...thus then go to Dragonite all my buddies are out recalled and all and straight back to Indigo Platue Kanto HQ where Lance will take up the role next day as i will go to Safforn and also slept there for 2 hours in front of Lance’s cabin(laugh),6-8...that’s the break-in but Oh! Trace oh my dear,don’t be so puzzled/you’ve seen the whole race/but tell me how that day had my bunch traveled/i had to know the persons and all systems so so well/only then could i tell to lets go all into the hell/if i had one intention of harming any good or bad/my bunch would’ve failed badly and mental chains to them would’ve made me mad/thus Goodra said on the last to the brats when they attacked us/we’ll die but why bother,lets be friends cause we’re thus(smile at Misty,Misty hugs Ash very frimly smiling at him,Ash hugs Misty very firmly)(all . and cheers for both Ash and Misty)...that’s why i call my bunch soulmates and you know most came by themselves”
Tracey(smile,few moments later) : “Pokemons of the Pokemon Master,the Master and the Master’s eternal flower once only all means(again cheers and .s)...”
Ash(laugh) : “Universally shared by all,thanks(all smile).but Trace oh Trace my dear/don’t yet get so happy/Gary my boy(all laugh),the nests may be near/yet you can’t really be less happy(all laugh)/Brock my leader,naive you may(all laugh),but also thus please hear...
Gengar is unhappy cause gym is too disiplined(all laugh)...Nivy felt his widom is good,but he wanted a bit to chill(all laugh)/Greninja was fine here,but desired to have a tour/Sableye is desperate cause a jackal he will lure(all laugh)/Chu wants to see his bunch and cajole Snorlax to be here(all laugh)/he’ll be forsaken if Crawdauntogator is anywhere near(all laugh)/but depite all attempts to keep the brat where he is/Garchomp won’t listen to any,cause Goldy told him refletion is this(all burst into laughter)...”
so Chu for 14 days,rest till i want them back(all laugh),here only stays our reflection specialist Garchomp to perfect the reflection techniques till i don’t know how long(all laugh)...ground type psudeo-legend dragon in water gym(all laugh) to also fly around at that pace with that size(all laugh) and he will definitely get into water too(all laugh) and yes he uses flamethrowers to see if fire too reflects or not(all burst into laughter)...may God bless us(all laugh),anyway,Violet was scared to death next day(laugh)...but they created a bigger miracle i don’t know whether you know but as the hellrounds went in Mist was in serious physical trouble with me being unable to help her a lot and it was on Bulbasaur and all my psychic holders to get her alright cause else i would’ve had to take her to a doctor which i only in the end did and that would’ve been a trouble...Bulbasaur sleep powdered her according to my and his own estimates cause i too was in similar plight mentally as i had to share my ideas with Mist and push her more and more...and the rest following Chu was keeping the outside at bay...that’s a real military i’ve got and that’s why they tamed all those legends there..too good just..and Goldy is 3 days behind from doing the same..(all laugh and .)..but Trace i’ve always wanted a Scyther(all laugh)..trade him MAR_SHAD_OW(all laugh)..anyway,anyway,Violet describe your bit at your comfort and ease..”
Violet(smile) : “no i was just thinking that how can anyone reach this level and only cause as you always say universality anyone can but then and that then is all about it...really who is is if you’re happy with yourself more than enough do not look aside(all smile)...anyway,Mist that time you know twice a week phone that’s it and all those securities and all threatened legal process against us and did all things possible to keep us away from her,anyway i heard that news as people were confused some mad at you and all then i heard you name was scared cause all that i knew,straight went to the gym and Mist was with Sarah may be after 3 months all crying and all then i go to her,by then her depression almost removed cause saw you of course(all smile,Ash laughs) and then told hugged me and was in profuse tears said she never knew what she was doing and all still cursing you so was i but i was happy that got my baby back...then stayed there went in the room beside the spot(all laugh)...Mist took sleep powder and all then i was alright not one sign next morning,knew Mist will be late told all here about it and all then Mist comes out at about 11:30 or so,gives the note(all laugh)...i almost fainted,Mist said it’s alright you didn’t do any harm then Golduck tell all it was hardly a trouble,Sarah and all doesn’t say a word as Elite4 was still on the Gym(all laugh) and they were warned(laugh) that morning itself by Simon(all laugh) of all people personally that they’ll be immediately reported to Referee Associetion(all laugh) and Gym Committes as well as to hall of fame and defamed for getting Mist into trouble and the papers were ready too incognito(all burst into laughter) and same if they told me or Mist about the call itself(all laugh),Victor was held up at Viridian at night entertaing Brawn and family of all on type disadvantages(all laugh) i just was so dumbfounded that how could he break-in there with all the security at the topmost level at a hall of fame gym...Lance was called then by me and just brushed it aside saying no physical harm so why bother insinuating(all laugh) that he knew the whole plan for ages(all laugh)...and then Mist herself said that she had to face you cause at your power we were just trifle and Mist said that all her pokemons many be won’t listen to her at the moment and all,so really it was hard,then later the party we all told her to still contact the police and all,Mist said no way they’ll get any clues cause Elite4 themselves are on us and all that,Sinnoh Elite4 also was there later,so Mist just said i’ll get rid of Ash myself(all laugh)..and then phoned your mom(all burst into laughter)...really with Ash ever the little baby(all smile)...
Ash(laugh) : “thanks,now anyway,so by that day it was all about Misty Waterflower who took 2 questions to totally break down and confess as usual(all laugh)..’i have a boyfriend’,’i want to know whether you’ve properly broken up of not’(all laugh),’it’s not a legal document like a divorce(all burst into laughter)’,’yes but you’re not happy either are you if you have...’,’already almost sobbs(all laugh)...’hum..what do you want to say’,’i was promiscous and thus you weren’t dating people despite me breaking up and 5 years no contact is too long to move away from ‘my Ash’ ‘,barely can stand as usual as soon as i imply ‘my Ash’(all smile)...’um..you cheated on me you’re a playboy...’,’i see,would you date me now(all burst into laughter)’,’no’(all laugh),’why’,’um..you’re a stranger(all burst into laughter)’,’so you don’t date strangers then’(all laugh),’..now the wisdom mask comes out and i cross that then totally deflated says like ‘um..Ash..um..do you want me to put up my ponytail(all laugh)?’...then of course i procceded for reasons you know,finally breaks down and says no immediately say you’re my boyfriend(all smile)...and so on,’i’m a playboy’,..screams,’NO,MY ASH IS ONLY MY BOY(all smile)’...then she gets what i was going through and lectures me on that(all laugh)..then i see she’s too emotional so just say,”Misty..”,’yes,now no more words you namecall,it’s M-I-S-T-Y,Misty,that’s your only girlfriend forever(all smile)...sobs..hum..why so many words..just hug me(all smile)...’then i finally before the marriage oath(all laugh) say that still i’ll namecall you(all laugh),sits down on grass like ‘why are you telling me to repeat same things so many time..sobs..i just want to hug you(all smile)’...i didn’t let her hug me except once or twice when i myself got a little emotional so she is very unhappy’(all smile),’so finally my Ash has given up that you’ve quitted and sat down on gras,bye bye that’s why i came,it’s all infatuation(all smile)’..then screams and cried so much by then and wasn’t ok with those stuffs not being taken so,so sweetly asks my Bulbasaur as if her own pokmeon just like she used to while travelling to help her to hug me(all smile)...’um..no my Ash never leaves me,why are you not giving me the ring’(all smile)...then i give the ring(laugh)..2 word ring was better than the  vulture killing oath-lecklace everyday(all laugh)..and when she first came i could see that how what she thinks of me cause all my 107 were around the whole lab was on alert,Lillie didn’t meet her being so depressed neither did Daisy,Professor Oak didn’t talk much,Gary wasn’t there,she had all her powers and all,then comes to me with so much dreaded name that all Elite4 combine can be laughed off so easily by me with 4 pokemons(all laugh)...Jynx,Jellicent,Gyarados and Dewgong(all laugh),yeah by-the-way i knew all the balls but she didn’t Crawdaunted them(all laugh)..Dewgong would’ve created a fiasco there only for my 50 Psychics to doze him off for 50 years(all laugh)..rest i knew TOO well(all laugh)..i myself have a Jellicent(all laugh) which my sweet Mist sweetly forgot..just a moment...(all smile,Misty smiles at Ash,hugging him very firmly then resting her head on his chest,Ash smiles at her then continues to tender her,few moments later)..right, so absolutely no trouble sweetly comes in and tries to argue with me as if in Viridian still(all smile)..then i get most of my Psychics to work on her while so many ghosts were on her with Sableye in charge(all laugh),Feraligator around her to remind that i was not a demon at all(all laugh)..just wanting to stay calm and answer calmly without crying cause no matter what i say,i myself haven’t created all this to re-reject her(all laugh)...Bulbasaur looks after her and all..and after my proposal as soon as i smile and hug her properly she has forgotten everything and just became the same 16 year old i saw but actually Daisy,you’re right it’s just 6 or 10 when she got her Starmie(smile,all smile),just plays with her pokemons and complains to them if her Ash isn’t hugging her all the time(all smile) and want’s her Ash all the time to complain that her little buddies are fondling her too much and not letting her to fondle them back(all smile) and also she wants her Ash to meet her only demand that she wants to hug him all the time and that’s it,thats all who is your little sis and my sweet wife Mist(all smile,Ash hugs Misty very firmly and smiles at her,Misty smiles)..not Mist-y though(all laugh,Misty smiles and keeps hugging Ash very firmly)..”
Tracey(laugh,few moments later) : “but then the nastiest evolution(all burst into laughter)..the highest form,the philosophy-boy(all laugh)..i first saw Misty didn’t see him or to be honest expected him or Misty to be there at that time then see him and a bit startled Misty frowns at me saying that you know this for 17 years and all then the philosophy-boy goes like,’Mr Skechit is returning immediately to inform that he has first hand proof now that i’m a playboy’(all laugh)..then i get angry and immediately reminds me of the quote so i get what the brat was upto all along just wanted to check himself though the process that made no sense then(all laugh) as it was a matter of Madgaleoranitarveltal(all laugh) and then i return and tell all and all jump on me(all laugh) ...Dase goes absolutely crazy(all laugh)..Lillie is all over Gary and Gary of all people was totally flustered and Professor Oak was so grave,Mrs Ketchum didn’t know what to say or do and all that then he comes in first word,marriage(all laugh)...then you all know..finally i sleep then that message(all laugh)...Brock it’s all for you man(all laugh)...”
Brock(laugh) : “my Viol flower as usual eats me up VIA phone(all laugh) like that monster has devoured my baby(all laugh)..then somehow i manage her and then Misty calls me and all,i was shocked and all that then Viol comes so much crying i tell her atleast calm down now and was all,then that brat probably knew i do check my phone for emegency(all laugh) at late night at 3:30 or so..how was that Ash(all laugh)..?”
Ash(laugh) : “VIA Doctor Trent Arnold(all burst into laughter) my 10 sources(all laugh) all of who are here now(all laugh) including the invisible 3(all laugh) and their beaus if new(all laugh),Viridian was on red alert as well and Brawn happily obliged to fondle Victor all night(all laugh) cause he wasn’t happy as you know(all laugh)..managed it on that day itself behind you(all laugh)...”
Brock(laugh) : “Trent now says you’re a real pest(all laugh)..anyway,so i see that message and hardly had ever been more angry and get Trace,who was charged at 2 positive and 2 negetive then(all laugh uncontrollably)..with the midnight day at most scorching glaze(all burst into laughter)...he never knew what to do but Ash how did you open the lock(all laugh)..?”
Ash(laugh) : “Dr. Professor Samuel Oak(all burst into laughter),Professor Emitarus,Pokemon Research Forum,Kanto section,and specialist on..(all burst into laughter)..well the obvious(all burst into laughter)...no really nowhere that brat would’ve been tolerated(all laugh)...personal connections new Professor Magmorter it(all burst into laughter)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “Ketchum,don’t spoil my balanced lion(all burst into laughter)..already mingling with nests(all burst into laughter)...”
Gary(laugh) : “two worded(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “surely too much words(all laugh)...told Professor they are too hurt need to play a prank(all laugh)..Trace is most calm as you know(all laugh)..so his phone is sanctified(all laugh)...well except for him and Daisy none knows either(all laugh)...this was custom i knew(all laugh)...Professor joked in quote,’hmm...5 years too Mistyvious(all burst into laughter,Misty blushes,Ash hugs her firmly laughing)’
Brock(laugh) : “so then Misty calls me(all laugh),’Misty are you..’,’not dumped’(all burst into laughter)..then he goes on and all you know(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “i realized him but get in Lil obviously was not well and said that Ash was nicknaming Misty(all burst into laughter)..anyway,calm her down a bit and all then next morning(all laugh)...at 6 ultimate emergency,world on fire(all laugh)...reach there,grandpa was silent,he knew every bit of it as Ash told him that he just wants to give a surprize to us and it’s about the expansion and all and wants to do all he can for the lab(all laugh)...Grandpa himself said 4:30 hour sleep at 84 but never better(all laugh)...i go in and Dave ate me up(all laugh)..saying all the plans and all(all laugh)...in the meantime Lil has been informed and she was trying to marry me again via phone(all laugh) and i just was laughing and tell her and remembering the two words(all laugh)..what a day that was really,but still best for Trace(all laugh)...”
Tracey(laugh) : “by all means SO GLORIOUS(all laugh)...that day was something(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “call ended may be around 4:25 or something(all laugh)..we went to sleep at 5:30(all laugh)..woke up at 7:30 just couldn’t sleep,Trace was static all the time(all laugh)..and i never felt so happy cause 19 years of misunderstanding of that level and just one sermon(all laugh)..i was so happy for Mist cause i knew what a beau she fished(all laugh)...then all those things were pouring onto both me and Trace how he ever gave all the signals of this honesty and we never realized it till he finally eloquented up(all laugh)..and anyone hearing that would think he’s the most cruel man(all laugh)...the words and meanings totally different but he said and it is without that language you can’t vent out what he had in him for all those 19 years really,still though 2 words will be ever honoured(all laugh)...then i call Lil and tell her,she can’t believe a thing and then Mist comes in and 3/4 hours all his antics then the surprizes and all..just unforgettable”
Lillie(laugh) : “Gary said an emergency in law section,i was almost dead thinking Ketchum now himself has started the procedures(all laugh)..anyway,Gary said no he is leaving(all laugh) so his bunch and all legal papers necessary and is shifting quickly plus some donations he has made and all so has to go...so i was awake barely slept for 4 hours and all..then Dase tells me that sermon(all laugh)..then i tell Gary that atleast Ketchum isn’t cheating(all laugh)..then Mist comes shows her ring and i then itself realized he really meant it about marriage but then hear how that was fetched(all burst into laughter)...and then the whole day...just amusing..(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “i first called the whole world(all laugh)...May first who cried her head off,’BRO!...cries...WHY WEREN’T YOU THE BEST MAN FOR BOTH(all laugh)...but um..Brock,are you sure that was not the proposal as well(all laugh)...too dangerous(all laugh)...’ then Drew of all roses were all over the place(all laugh)..,’um..yeah,i talked with him 3 days or so ago but this..um..are you sure that it’s like..um..not a prank(all laugh)..like to get her pre-sweetened to finally date-sweeten(all burst into laughter)...”...then Foster and Flores,Flores met Ash twice,once VIA phone(all laugh) when they were married and all talked all professional as much as she could cause was warned not to ruin marriages(all burst into laughter)...Ash was very nice to her BUT professional(all laugh)...and then during Elite4 visited,had a detailed talk professionally(all laugh),Foster told him when i got married which was just put aside by best wishes(all laugh)...yes,as Gary said naming someone else’s spouse is heinous(all burst into laughter)...he came to know about Mrs Daisy Skechit and Mrs Lillie Oak VIA Professor after 1 and 2 years of marriage respectively(all burst into laughter) and finally before leaving Foster told him that Viol was his sister-in-law(all laugh),this was again wished away(all laugh) including me as yeah Brock was ever great with the knowledge aspect on breeding and medicine and all finally was called off this wishes after 15 seconds(all laugh) as best wishes for Doctor Slate and Mrs Waterflower Slate and thank you all(all laugh) as was in case of Tracey when Professor Oak said(all laugh)..it took 10 seconds(all laugh)...just the joint best wishes ON SURNAMES(all laugh) and ended similarly..so Foster on just hearing that they have patched up and are marrying very soon goes like,’um..at this time of night(all laugh)..um..morning(all burst into laughter)...are they watching movies(all uncontrollably laugh)...then is told about the discourse...um..yeah i get it so very happy to hear that this meaningless misunderstanding is erased no matter how prolonged it was but with Ash,does it also help our profession(all burst into laughter)’...then i tell him yeah try it on Steelix(all burst into laughter)... then Flores,’um..yeah,bro i understand so sweet hope my rock realizes something(all burst into laughter)...alway so absent unless professional(all burst into laughter)..but um..is it like a romantic letter(all burst into laughter)’...then there’s Max,who you know first sign of personal troubles with people that were his sister’s travel companions would immediately go off or else he’ll be Torchiced(all laugh)...’um...yeah,i had to flee actually(all laugh)...Ash all i remeber told me to show all time indifferent disposition(all laugh) so that none catches your emotions(all laugh)..yeah such mindset ever dangerous with ego(all laugh)...and was so sorry to see Misty like that is ever my big sis..and you know exactly the relation to Ash and May but much subdued level cause of huge age difference and not travelling together and all that...will be great but if i tell this to Mia..she’ll want me to repeat it again and again(all laugh)...cause i ever followed Ash,don’t show..um..emotions(all burst into laughter)...Brock i understand these but really shouldn’t i test myself(all burst into laughter)...like i tell Mia to dump me(all uncontrollably laugh)...then i’ll not be around for 5 years(all uncontrollably laugh,tears)..he would try to immediately model it and put himself in(all laugh)...then i have to go through these(all laugh) so would she(all laugh)...Brock isn’t it better to have family in 5 years instead(all burst into laughter)...”...so i tell him to shut up(all laugh)..then Harris who says,’yeah,yeah,i know,all along too dense too dramatic both of them(all laugh)’,then Brenda says,’aww,Harry shut up(all burst into laughter),yeah,so overjoyed we are to hear Brock this grass ever brown(all burst into laughter) from where did he get these(all laugh)..’,’Kalos universities(all laugh)’,’hmm..too dramatic i see(all laugh) but so nice(all laugh)..’...then Kane next,”um..yeah,Hana said acting all along(all burst into laughter)..exactly why ever told both her and Irie never bother about such lunatic Gyaradoses(all laugh) were they finally without phones dating all night(all burst into laughter)...”,then Irene(all laugh),’yeah Brock even fooled you all(all laugh) why does he polish his bunch to heaven like that(all laugh),surely once such a pest is fished none can think anything else(all laugh) and that sort of a Gyarados isn’t found anywhere either like Reshiram(all laugh)’..i said yeah,ever been a pest that one and Gyarados we all know(all laugh),’but these things were told to that Gyarados at her most lunatic state(all laugh) is he alive(all laugh)’,i said don’t think so Gyarados was intruding mid call then itself(all laugh)..then Braum(all laugh) ,’yeah,um..thought finally that they were being normal(all burst into laughter) so guessed just a normal break up my bad(all burst into laughter)..philosophy,and then spends the first night next dawn(all laugh)..anyway Brock just don’t bother about philosophies just can’t live without each other so to defend themselves got a text book and read to you(all burst into laughter)..but nice lines(all laugh)..lets see my prizes,waterhomie(all burst into laughter)...’ water also Flavia says(all laugh),’yeah,i see Ash ever shows too professional just too caring can’t forget the eternal wife(all laugh) but these lines now Braum will try eat me up and definitely fail cause the words aren’t well defined in manual(all burst into laughter)..’,and then Tony boy(all laugh) Tony boy says,’um..i see,with his name now and those ghosts(all laugh) did they scare Misty too much and he was waiting outside the door(all burst into laughter) no thought they have moved on no matter what but that is for mere mortals(all laugh) you know Brock these two turned on the whole world thus their current positions(all burst into laughter) why would one want to destroy everything and not call each other(all laugh) i guess when none else is there in the world the two will meet again as they have(all laugh) yeah surely the ghosts influened it(all burst into laughter) and now showing as if great philosophers to that the whole world gets to know that they will suffer again if one doesn’t hug another too firmly enough to kill him or her(all burst into laughter) anyway,which book Brock i will need it you know psychos(all burst into laughter)...”..the Olivia gets it to judge the psychos(all laugh) and she knows me as well for ages like her hubby and travel companion(all laugh) and Irene too too well(all laugh) and all the rest for ages beyond time(all laugh)..so Olivia says,’what did Tony just say about psychics(all laugh)..’,’patience(all laugh)’,’yeah,left gym leading now too much glee with Mantine(all laugh) did you supply the lines(all laugh)..teach your junior too only then he will have considerations(all laugh)..’..then Susana of all friends(all laugh)...the only female friend improfessional to Ash still(all laugh) and only one who was professional with him alongside Harris and Kane cause she was in Johto and after 18 OUT OF PROFESSION(all laugh)...the rest TWO(all laugh) fled the scene long ago(all laugh)..now to give her views the only person in the world who knew about Ash’s personal life during that phase was Susana(all laugh) cause she was out of profession(all laugh) and the financial management(all laugh)..so i say what she later told me first says,’yeah all along..knew that he has no relations with you and Gary is professional as ever(all laugh) and then Harris and Kane as well strictly professional(all laugh) only i was confided in cause out of profession and Javier is the manager only(all laugh) i was told after the break-up i couldn’t believe it(all laugh) said the dragons tempered her(all laugh) i knew about Unova a bit that my company doesn’t have a office there(all laugh) and dragon type means a Dragonite(all laugh) so i asked how many Dragonites you have(all laugh) said only 1 rest 14 too special(all laugh) then asked me to look up Giratina(all laugh) said a ghost dragon with psudeo-legend catergory(all laugh) that word i remembered cause all were foisted upon Metagross repeatedly as his toffee-flower was looking at him with utmost devotion of an eternal wife(all laugh) that name and scene i can never forget(all laugh) anyway so i guessed that now a ghost type that is like 10 Gengars together(all laugh)...by the way Gengar is you see dictionary term for frivolity(all laugh)..so understood that the brat isn’t happy that those pictures and all were around but he won’t call Mist but she didn’t either(all laugh) later after undercover too much money and all then asked him now want to patch up or move on i guess after seeing the hell(all laugh),since 16 either my Mist or bust(all laugh) so i was suspicious(all laugh) cause the way said my Mist was strange for someone that hasn’t been mouthed off during patching(all laugh) so i say may be she wants to move on(all laugh),well she has an year back(all laugh) since then never saw her in voice on person(all laugh) then i say that whoose your new Mist then(all laugh) says,’my ideas(all burst into laughter) no not the tangible or intangible memories(all laugh) all thrown to the dustbin where Misty belonged whole time(all laugh) just my 15 year long horrible mistake that i thought she was my Mist(all burst into laughter) so i said,Ash please you’ll lose yourself if you continue like this(all laugh) your Mist might be thinking the same exactly now(all laugh) says,’no losing depends on my bunch(all laugh) i’m safe there and mom is also there still so that’s ok for a so and so i don’t get depressed and mad(all laugh) but my Mist is true then will herself be back to me(all laugh) then i realized the brat is at bay now(all laugh) so then let him drown there(all laugh) and later said like have you found someone yeah few samples hover around(all laugh) so i was laughing saying undercover has covered your language surely(all laugh) says no i directly told a few(all burst into laughter) and few of my chosen gender too(all burst into laughter) all same some men try to show that they know what a man means(all burst into laughter) and some women does the same that they have this idea of a woman(all burst into laughter) so i fled the scene(all laugh) when i was engaged told him said congratulations is it arranged(all laugh) i said absolutely the opposite(all laugh) well i see congrats to your fiancee and you as well for recognizing each other(all laugh) but don’t mind just that you’re my long time close friend but some men are really beautiful(all burst into laughter) i was laughing in my mind(all laugh) i said no absolutely ugly(all burst into laughter) then was more happy(all laugh)’ now coming to the conversation just after i informed her with supplimentary throries about the 35th marriage(all laugh)..’um..Brock this is awesome but um...if couples have to logically show everything(all burst into laughter)...doesn’t that lessen the emotions(all burst into laughter)..no my post in management see so many people but this kind of dense pricks(all laugh) forever first thing was Misty(all laugh)..no you know Susan you being in your position see so many great people but ah my Mist(all laugh)..and saw her after Orange(all laugh) if that’s not your wife for 18 years who is(all laugh) should’ve married exactly then..each few friends that weren’t a boy(all laugh)..was scoffed off for being a girl(all laugh)..and had 5 in total(all laugh)..cause they were acting like boys(all laugh)..finally Kity and Mimi was there had to professionally battle him each day despite being in contest and another in special type training of flying types so since his Misty flower went back was even more ferocious on girls(all laugh) had to save their backs(all laugh)..all tricks to drive girls away(all laugh)..marriage at first sight some said(all laugh),they themselves don’t know what curse they’ve brought(all burst into laughter)..yeah spoke with Misty ever since then till they thought lets try the divorce trick so that the tears and burns will reinvigorate us(all burst into laughter)..Misty ever said since 18 ‘my Ash’(all laugh)..so nice but as soon as i say alright how’s my special friend doing(all laugh)..no he’s as usual shows himself to be childish just like that but still so caring ah! Ash..anyway..(all laugh)..really such once ever girl of a wife(all laugh) can be the girl-wife of the same sort of a dense brat(all laugh)..girls if they uttered the word friend was off(all burst into laughter)..i was spared cause i never talked about anything on friends,girls,boys him me nothing(all laugh).. but most so cause i was out of profession and he needs to be fed cryptic mental philsophical materials(all laugh)..since day one pesters me on emotional management(all laugh)..now if i say one word that boys and girls have certain different issus i would’ve been off(all laugh)..impersonal gender unspecific emotional management(all laugh) which has to be outside his profession cause his profession was eat battle faint repeat(all laugh)..then i got married to Javier who sadly had to be financial adviser(all burst into laughter)..all sorts of questions came around how to force authorities to go bankrupt(all burst into laughter)..and Mrs Ketchum ever asks us so much money doesn’t bother to even know the digits(all laugh)..mom just get rid of this mess(all laugh)..has a few accounts all Mrs Ketchum has to manage(all laugh)..and yeah why do you need money catch pokemons eat grass with them(all burst into laughter) battle amongest them repeat(all laugh)..and we heard a bit about playboy(all laugh)..both me and Javier know all tricks to get rid of poor fans(all laugh)..himself told me this before my marriage that this this allegations are coming so may be it is right to be friends who don’t have much contacts now(all laugh)..scoffed at him saying why are you after fans(all laugh)..they try to show that they’re beyond physicality(all burst into laughter)..yeah doesn’t remember i’m a girl(all laugh)..so i said yeah don’t bother not keeping contacts if you were in my profession each boardroom meeting would’ve become a master servant stuff(all laugh)..and i told him about Javier just about when i met him and all cause i knew this brat knows boys even better(all laugh)..if a skirmish at school first would get angry then later brush them aside all emotional(all laugh) you see barely do we need anything like schools and all only pokemons(all laugh)..barely passed in most(all laugh)..each time didn’t study full curriculla just what he felt was necessary for him anything else just junk food even told girls too much eating surplass junk gives you stomach troubles all flows away(all burst into laughter)...that was enough to scare 113 year olds and we were 13(all burst into laughter),if told you’ll fail,another time same class a bit more solidification of knowledge(all burst into laughter),15 years out to speciality then 16 out to wild why bother(all laugh) in speciality Gary ever said too devoted about everything except everything but what is a pokemon exactly(all burst into laughter)..yeah,that brat Zeraora was there as well(all laugh)..each physical activities teacher will be gruelled with all questions on geography(all laugh)..knows absolutely nothing else(all laugh)..if we tell all geometry and else needed cause pokemon attacks and the flying types and all um they’ll tell me themselves(all burst into laughter)..and we know that they did infinitely more and still doing even more each moment(all laugh)..whoose your girlfriendmon how many beaus but we cherish you so much(all laugh) yet are you happy(all laugh)..so anyway Susana of all people goes on for a long time(All laugh) TWICE that day(all laugh)....math teachers were told only to give him problems that are important for instruments like compass and GPS spotting locations(all laugh) all else full junk(all laugh)..and all those instruments were minutely learnt as a technician does(all laugh) and wore a chorometer ever no ordinary time(all laugh)..and always made mistakes when such math probelms were given cause changed the values and add constraints to get it harder(all burst into laughter)..so spot the location of wife a bit longitudinal mistake so into the lake(all uncontrollably laugh)..wife as well was waiting there from before(all laugh) should’ve been on a boat so it would’ve been sweeter(all laugh)..a total random stranger somehow avoids a fatal accident both first day then one says um Mist sorry a bit of a mistake honey(all laugh) it’s ok Ash but um why are you not hugging me sweetie because i’m only 16(all burst into laughter)..really today his whole life i can see as a movie thus saying absolute densest brat(all laugh)..had it not been for his eternal Mist wife each girl would’ve been Chued down for being a girl(all laugh)...”,then Javier says,’um..yeah Ash,too childish too nice too extremely frank(all laugh)..heard about his forever wife(all laugh) so marries again classmates(all burst into laughter)”..Susana and Javier was in noon but that day finally the Cili(all burst into laughter)..Cili(all laugh)..Cili says like,’um..that’s ok but isn’t this too childish(all burst into laughter)’...finally in Unova i rather emotionally told him about it and he said yeah ever very introverted but then even from there Ash says like,’i see sweet sweet Cili(all laugh),what are the positions in reloaded hall of fame(all laugh) and your ashed-out abjectly Ketchumed ‘mam had to buy my Chu only then see my dear Cili from 10000 km away Telplocus’ got ONLY but fully Ketchumed(all laugh)...and this whole took may be 3 minutes or more to say for him,Cilan was laughing and saying only such a pest and a brat of a bunch(all laugh) can ever pester 103 rarest legends enough to lose their minds back to home(all laugh) and still return to irritate even doctors like this while they’re treating them at both hospitals(all laugh)..Cilan first knew realized instantly the bunch is under threat if not the legends as well and so straight went to the pokemon centre where Crawdaunt and Palkia stayed then got the info went to Ash and Palkia,Crawdaunt,Goodra and Noivern all pestered him to death even then totally messing up his dress(all laugh) but once he was in the the fear of termination was totally gone cause he knew Ash’s whole bunch from Unova itself of all places and he being from Unova himself a whole Kalos-Unova region wide renouned to maxima dragon breeder including all other specises(all laugh)..he said once the 4 saw me as if was so relieved cause the people there were telling us it must be that they’ve been somehow alerted about the termination and is extremely doubtfull and got our bunches at their side almost(all laugh)..they actually told Cilan that they are showing the legendary pokemon intelligence of the height of the Xormnuh+ that were here(all laugh) if not more which we doubt was not the case(all laugh)..are these guys some sort of an interbreeding(all laugh)..Cilan was assured that the termination unless they can prove it never happeneing cause if not for the doctors the very best would resist it then there were 4 legends whoose names are too elusively long(all laugh) were here 1 for 1 day and another 3 for 2 each scoffed us aside saw the bunch and threatened us don’t you like more than real movies(all laugh)...Cilan then was laughing saying exactly that these 4 are such only then did the 4 legends said so just inter pokemon bonhomie of unthinkable nature cause the name is same no matter what(all laugh and cheer for Pokemon)..so then the people and the doctors were very happy but then asks Cilan that is their master something great(all laugh)..by then Cilan already had met Ash and what a meeting(all laugh)..in that condition Cilan goes in and is greeted and he was told before about Ash’s limitations takes time to speak and the instruments and all and his mind was fluctuating with everything so sometimes a bit of dellirium as well the tone was like that all time and with that he talked with him so the greeting,’ah Cili do you remember that 369 was the target 69 still remain right(all burst into laughter)’ Cilan said i realized if death comes this pest will jump forward dark gym 1251th (all laugh)...then his condition was not ok was talking absurd things somethimes in between jovial normal stuffs and then only Cilan said was serious,and talked only about what some of his bunch does and what they need and so on and told me like i was in a way connected to each no matter where or which plane we live in and not once did he speak about Misty infact which was only after Persy told about her did he became more incensed later told Cilan i just erased her off i had to else my bunch will vanish with me and i don’t want that with the second option ever being open but never thought that even she despite all the devastation will be dragged around like that anyway,then all the time his antics still went on so Cilan tells the doctors at centre that the master and his bunch exactly same(all laugh)...and then the pokecentre doctors too found out later who were told with Goodra and Noivern waiting beside him,’my thanks doctors many many thanks cause my bunch can’t word their emotions(all laugh)/we’re dead without you doctors but please allow their motions(all burst into laughter)...and you know all were fondled to death(all laugh) and Crawdaunt destroyed 1 drees each(all laugh)...i still remember Dr Zyko was the main and he told us a few serious things and then we all go to Ash,who already wants to know but the doctor doesn’t want to tell him cause it was about his nerves states and all and then Ash says like,’i see,my beloved Dr Zyko(all laugh)..yeah even there same language to threaten them Via Goodra(all laugh)...may i have an inference(all laugh)...Dr Zyko by then is irritated enough says please just rest,’blood,pus,plasma(all burst into laughter) but out of the body Dr do you ever SERVE(all burst into laughter)/please doctor my Goodra is hungry(all laugh),tell me about which is that NERVE(all burst into laughter)..this takes 3 minutes or more and Dr Zyko was just laughing and waiting for him to finish to show us what was going on for 27 days(all laugh)..Dr Zyko told us unless we say and with his difficulties,whole day that’ll go on and Goodra will join in later(all laugh) threatening them by playing with instruments on other rooms(all laugh)...’ really some pest our Ash has become(all laugh)...and Dr Zyko is the whole reason he came out of that you know he was later sent after Persy’s intervention and Ash’s personal attendents too were changed,Ash didn’t trust the previous ones cause they werent listing to him and all and Dr Zyko said the previous one were told like,’see doctors this mess that we wrongly call a BODY(all laugh)/full of dirts,yet you must cause my Goodra is a bit too MOODY(all burst into laughter)..made sure they are treating well yet loathing him so first oppotunity to shift fled the scene and then Dr Zyko was far really realized him and all that and he said he was greeted like,’welcome Dr welcome please make yourself at your home/the body is pollution you’d agree but would also see my Goodra roam(all burst into laughter)...’..then he said Goodra when came in jumped on him to fondle him to death(all laugh)..and that’s a psudeo-legendary psychic dragon with that size inside that small room where after 3/4 days always he zapped in(all burst into laughter)..Dr Zyko infact said that Ash was in life threat cause the previous people never knew his condition cause they weren’t specialists with people in Ash’s profession thus didn’t understand almost anything about the actual troubles which were such rare themselves but Goodra made sure that all atleast try to be at their best and immediately tell Persy about it cause Goodra you know threatened the whole world there while they said the whole pokemons they had were being lectured in pokelife(all laugh)..and the next nearest pokemon centre was hosting Crawdaunt(all burst into laughter) who had Palkia of all pokelogicians with him(all laugh) ever to say that he doesn’t understand how he can attack at all cause he doesn’t understand how others do it cause they are not his type or if so then you should be like me cause you understand me thus you you can’t uderstand any attacks either(all burst into laughter)..what a logical chain and all that with being a psudeo-legend(all laugh)..and those 3 were told to mishave by Goodra himself(all laugh)..Ash you know just told him that he’s feeling good enough inside but the people weren’t helping him so keep them alert till we go there and Goodra at that condition was too happy to oblidge and set others on despite their condition itself(all laugh)..then he on the very second day after Goodra met him again told him that they must not believe in any human beings anywhere unless who they know very well personally for a long time is there then told about Gary and Tracey cause i wasn’t familiar to Goodra and Noivern to my relief(all laugh) then only Crawdaunt knew me too well there to my utter misfortune though(all laugh) and Palkia, Goodra and Noivern all knew Cilan too well for his well being(all laugh) especially Noivern(All laugh) and Crawdaunt did too well all did cause all went to Unova even Sharpedo(all laugh) but not to that extent as much as certainly Noivern did(all laugh) so he was an Option even at the pokemon centre and if they try to shift them aside from other pokemons then immediately attack them to faint them with psychics and tell Noivern to control each pokebrat and after you succeed immediately escape the centre with every power you have and try to go back to the wild in a do or die situation cause i will only be able to meet you again if you’re in wild and don’t try to contact Crawdaunt and Palkia cause you know you can’t so save youselves if you succeed they will be fine...then Goodra understood this do and die stuff so alerted Noivern then Crawdaunt and Palkia had to be brought,Ash demaned all four togethger while Goodra threatened them with extremely strong hallucinations and recruiting their bunchs against them of course(all laugh) and they realized that this is dangerous so all four were brought and then kept together after the 12th day with same instructions given to them and that was really the only way to protect them and all four were brain washing the pokecentre pokemons(all laugh) who were actually on their side as Cilan said(all laugh) cause they are substandard(all laugh) but that fear that Ash had wasn’t quite true then cause top class doctors were present at pokecentres who spoke with Ash as well and they would never have allowed the termination order unless Persy directly passed the opinion with right proofs in front of them but then Persy was a suspect too and Dave was fired at the right time from the office for trying to force an emergency way before and then only could alert us and tried his best to force the and he and Mr Maple did the things to make our passage safe and informed Cilan so Ash tought of that though i don’t think they could’ve done that with 2 top professionals each centre and total 4 there if 1 protested it would’ve been hard and enough for us to intervene but Persy now as told us today again that he has got a huge lesson and Samantha too agreed that first of all except Ash none can tame an abused legend of that stature of a Xormnuh and not kill him with may be using a Butterfree against anyone as it did cause Butterfree was them(all laugh) and thus Ash will be protected as much as in Persy’s powers were unless his own place was attacked by such legends though he will ever pester Ash for how pests should be controlled with right language(all laugh,Ash shakes his head laughing) and on other plans cause no matter how legendary is his wife he souldn’t be allowed to only enjoy a private life forever(all laugh) and so he has to be the anti rocket consultant(all laugh) the greatest boss was consulted(all laugh) by him impersonally without naming(all laugh) who told just give Ash the protection that you gave me(all laugh) so that he’s not accused by people who asks me that a man who can get Team Rocket down with 2 most common pokemons befriending them would want to become illegal suddenly cause he wanted to make friends with legends(all laugh) so if anyone has any confusinons about how things should be done illegally send them to me(all laugh) they won’t leave the place cause they don’t even know a mere Mewtwo well(all laugh) and yes an Arceus too(all laugh) that is basic chapter will take 6+3+1=10 years(all laugh) and if any brat is caught trying to better me then just feed me such food(all laugh) cause i’m hungry as i’ve not got real opponents to topple(all laugh) and he was told about the 103 legends before and later joked why the 4 had to depart without me if they were here i would’ve loved it that how they being such ididots to not come out and legally topple the Elite4 cause they would’ve been stars forever here abuse or not due to the experiments alone(all laugh) so the greatest boss is a big hurdle now for Elite4 to be idiots cause a mere Mewtwo and an insignificant Arceus must be caught and not befriended for life legally before(all laugh) then the three were contacted by Persie again after greatest boss told him to get the 3 if still any confusion is there about certain Pikachus(all laugh),so Persy went impersonally again(all laugh) and just uttered sweet cute idiot(all burst into laughter) that’s their code for Ash(all burst into laughter)...Ash a bit..(all laugh)...
Ash(laugh) : “well told this to Mist before you caught me that night(all laugh) in Kalos we had to meet during court cases where they got me saying whoose your beau,i said none,the better one said you’re too sweet to not be attacked(all burst into laughter)..right(all burst intro laughter) and the lesser one said thus you must’ve taken precaution(all burst into laughter)...the(all laugh) other way around(all burst into laughter) so then i said yeah but broke up(all laugh) they said is that your first travel companion now Cerulian gym leader in special category gym soon to be hall of famer and the everpresent mermaid whenever Violet wasn’t(all laugh) of the great water show sensational sisters is a certain Ms Misty Waterflower(all laugh) i said why defame stars(all burst into laughter) they said the rest 3 were namecalled buffoons(all burst into laughter) i said don’t insult my sisters,says only the second Mrs May Maple Blackmore,judge in contests with permissions in Sinnoh,Orange and Johto the only to draw 3 back to back grand contests with her husband Mr Drew Blackmore who was her travel companion for ages(all laugh),i said why after everyone still(all laugh),no we certainly don’t know much about a Mr Brock Slate though we assume he’s in breeding or in nursing or may be doctor by now no naive to be a gym leader(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head while laughing) or anything else(all laugh) but Viridian has a great school for such budding professionals though(all laugh) and we guess he has may be got married to no more Ms Violet(all laugh) cause her performances has been affected recently(all laugh) and also when we met Ms Violet to eavesdrop on her because you told to(all laugh,Ash shakes his head laughing) for such stars to suddenly get so frank after the most easiest tricks(all laugh) simply means a matter of hearts(all laugh) and the other way was that our naive man(all laugh)...yeah slated poor Steelix(all laugh,Brock again shakes his head laughing) has now given up his duties certainly as gym leader his father Mr Kane Slate looked after it and his mom Mrs Giana Raskin Slate was the gym leader for some times a lot in Yevstar Town,Johto(all laugh) yeah we know about his family and the current gym leader a Mr Foster Slate and all about him as you know about rock types and also who we are(all laugh)...i said Meowth can’t do a thing especially against rocks so trying by yourself to remove(all laugh) says may be(all laugh) then goes on,and also we know about a Mr Tracey Skechit too gentele a man(alll burst into laughter,Tracey laughs shaking his head) well then was a boy(all burst into laughter) as you know we know all about the activities of Cerulian gym as well and especially which lab was professionaly connected there(all laugh) we found yours(all laugh) so the thing is that the two with your once rival who was a Tyranitar away from beating you(all burst into laughter,Gary .ly laughs) might be around the 1 and the 3(all laugh) but they are great professionals in their careers they were offered along their nest(all laugh) but you know idiots(all laugh)..i say leave kids alone(all laugh) yeah a Tyranitar and all ghosts(all laugh) everyday enough for two lives(all laugh) so you see extracting information has ever been a rather hobby(all burst into laughter) and your friends are too well known but one is a girl among friends(all laugh) i said after all why after my sister then,says she was too easy with you like a sis(all burst into laughter) i said and the others were not(all burst into laughter) says the next two were egotistical namecalls(all laugh) so was of no use to us cause they won’t have any contacts with you after they turned back may be third not the 4th for sure too scared(all burst into laughter) her can’t be said the namecall male version who specializes in...again can’t be said here(all laugh)...thus shows himself to be smart but... again can’t be said(all laugh)...so may be a distant friend atmost or future changes in...again can’t bes aid(all laugh)...so it’s a matter of a toss(all laugh) and the ones we see roam around here(all laugh) though they are at another city now(all laugh) they are no more than choised brats(all laugh) but for your current position to have your way without the breed called the media..then some stuffs about the choised brats and media that can’t be said(all laugh)...so those brats are right choices(all laugh) but it’s Kalos things bloom here beware(all laugh) i said just infauation(all laugh) yeah we know a namecall like that who..again blank(all laugh)...all cause her parents who...not mentioned(all laugh)..just sentimental card(all laugh) may be feeding the brat to the other male looking brat(all laugh) and then about them that’s not said(all laugh) is right(all laugh) i said exactly but please lets leave(all laugh) they say unless you tell we’ll have to do the interviews ultimately conveying our thanks to the whole Elite4 who are..blank(all laugh)..for making us enemployed(all laugh) then your name will come too and we’ll add that we believed in you to get us away from the crime and all cause your honesty and trust is simply proved by the fact that you’ve remained with the same girl you saw at 16 in the very beginning of your journey(all laugh),i said how do they know the other way around after 17 years(all laugh),that girl was your wife the first time we saw(all laugh),none namecalls her friend in a jungle both being clueless against Team Rocket(all laugh) and she always namecalled you(all laugh) and we can never forget that face with that cute smirk looking away from you blushing like nothing(all laugh) and saying that line in such an amusing tone of a little 18 year old,’never in a million years’(all burst into laughter and .) cause only of the N confirmed our enquiry on formalities(all burst into laughter) but then immediately namecalled you(all laugh) on the face of such calamity mid ocean(all laugh) she was trying to play you girlfriend so hard but couldn’t ever cause you were her husband(all laugh) i said broken for long..they made a face as if i told them i was dead(all laugh) then they said either can’t be said(all laugh) at the gym or just grab the namecall out of that namecalled gym(all laugh)...right(all burst into laughter),and if she has any choised namecalls by mistake(all laugh)just send them a certain kind of rocket at home with a line that history self repeats(all burst into laughter and .) that will be enough to take back every ring imaginable(all laugh) with proper repeated apologies to your and her whole family(all laugh) that the namecalled boy scouts ever imagined even if Elite4 heads(all laugh) and they themselves will not be seen again anywhere(all laugh) so i tell them fine if i ever marry another girl i’ll tell they say challenge it will be that namecall(all laugh) i said fine challenge renumerating(all laugh),we get to talk to your wife or fiancee once for 15 minutes after marriage in your presence alone from the spot and not those...cant be said(all laugh)...and then if it’s her we will change your code from mustn’t be told ever(all laugh) her first words of stammering freindship with you(all laugh) and if we lose Mewoth scratches us(all laugh) infront of you,i told Meowth that you’ve become an old man(all laugh),tried to scratch me(all laugh) now he has this idea of couples(all laugh) you all know what he is and his intelligence and then he was awakened to the fact that the 2 finally married and all so each couple of persons of opposite gender that are together for 5 minutes muct absolutely be either couples or sworn in enemies(all laugh) so now he gets the clue and tries to scratch me saying grab that namecall immediately(all laugh) cause Meowth being who he is just the name Misty and my travel companion water gym and those lines in between are too much more than enough to tell him who it’s about(all laugh) then went to Chu bro midway thorugh our conversation(all laugh) who said no i haven’t seen my Pikachupi for a long time again complains to the two all his fault not talking with his girlfriend for long(all laugh) so anyhow the pest is calmed down and all that was the last personal meeting 3 years and 2 months back(all laugh) so the deal was done then i keep contact once a month 15 minutes just to know if all things are fine cause their ban is lifting next month or the next to that only so thus i too am under spotlight till my sponsors get free(all laugh) but they surely needs no defending(all laugh) i told you just that too nice at heart own pokemons too much fondled that’s all(all laugh) just an ilusion madness families you know thus saved(all smile) and what pokemons they have(all laugh) i used the great Wobbuffet(all burst into laughter) and what strength that boy has you know absolute Goldy by every means(all laugh)..saved us so many times a day and also saved those 2 outside with another great Confragigus(all burst into laughter) and mine was suspicious of that choised brat(all laugh) anyway those two did save the two many times under and above so it’s just nice that thay returned their bunch wich had a plethora of too great pokemons so now they both are at very good positions but in Unova(all laugh) they knew certainly the 4 buffoons but again said on being asked before i left for Unova that no idea about what they are upto but too dangerous legends are around for sure(all laugh) and they had to save their heaven really that they were at and couldn’t flee the scene so straight i told Persy that if any of the confidents then who are having a new found life for a long time are dragged and again put into the hell they are so desperate to erase from their minds i may take up laws in my hands and get a few legends in my group and Persy knows i will be more legal than the laws as no legends will be illegally tempered so Persy gave his words and did shield them enough for the rest for themselves to solve and there’s another 6 to 8 such across the world all Persy looked after and you know from my sweet bro about them too well(all laugh) no really as much as May just found Dave later that’s all(all smile) and Lance excused himself midway thorough my personal discussion with them(all laugh) cause he knows me and them too well(all laugh) namecalling himself(all laugh) just said final party picture 30 sold(all laugh) before Mist could speak(all laugh) so says toast 62(all laugh) i say toast empty bottle(all laugh) so they get 30(all laugh) and spoke with Mist i assured her no trouble don’t go overboard just(all laugh) and was beside her to interpret and review the language(all laugh) Mist was shocked by the language(all laugh) i said just their way to express hapiness themselves were extremely strict and firm even being team rocket so don’t believe others can out of it(all laugh) don’t bother like to have fun and get under people’s skin(all laugh) know me well enough and my word is enough,’by Cascade 19th millions in an umpteenth’(all laugh and .)...right(all laugh and .),gratitude out(all laugh)...right(all laugh and .),so then they speak a bit about themselves a nothing Mist reminds them of herself(all laugh) and all saw Mist and the viseversa after 11 years thankfully(all laugh) they had the gist of a cute little 16 year old sweet girl trying to prove to the whole world that she’s a Gyarados(all laugh) a sweet one(all smile)...right(all laugh),only when around her certain travel companion(all laugh)...sweetie(all smile)...cause(all smile) for her Ash her unfathomable yearning is not being properly expressed cause of her age(all laugh)...right(all laugh),so just the quote after that cause they also knew more than Mist about the gym leader(all laugh) then they ask for the code(all laugh) i whisper to Mist what they are saying hugging her in front of Lance(all laugh) so Mist blushes too much to talk(all laugh)...right(all laugh),so then Lance laughs and tell signal the technicals to go on with the call without a drop and so i then say the buzz(all laugh) ‘studip jerk lazy bufoon that sweet cute idiot’ take any(all laugh)..they say 3 i say fine(all laugh)..then in fornt of her asks me professionaly 4 packed(all laugh) i say earning not necessary(all laugh) they say stars can’t carry(all laugh) two of you did marry(all laugh and .) so that confirms that Viol’s both interviews are right(all laugh,cheers for Brock and Violet) then they say similarity then in Lil and Gary(all burst into laughter,.,cheers for Team Rocket and Jesse and James and Meowth even more laughter,.) so now me and they say cause it’s 30 minutes(all laugh) but i scoff at the technicals say name the better then add 5(all laugh and .) so they happily do at our side and they just namecalled their’s to say then 3 more and 5 and 5(all laugh and . cheer),which they have to do cause Lance of all people hinted before(all laugh)
so i say,
professionals living their personal lives then how’s the trouble(all laugh)/find another Trace then Dase to double(all burst into laughter,. cheer for Team Rocket)/but protecting the rocket from self devastation(all laugh)/only reuniting on cover battling generations(all laugh)/so denounce the evils of truth and love(all laugh and .)/truely extending our reach to stars above(all smile)/real rocket then light of soul boss isn’t that right(all cheer)/my boss too is the soul comrades what’s a fight(all cheer and . for the Boss)/incognito again till personally frenemies this and next life(all cheer and and .)/only enemies again and again in finals with Crawdauntogator(all laugh) and thus ever without a strife(all cheers for Crawdauntogator) (Misty hugs Ash firmly smiling at him with little tears is her eyes,Ash smiles and wipes off Misty’s tears hugging Misty firmly whispers ‘soulmate’,Misty giggles) yeah,then after that they were very happy really for both of us and all of us infact wished all we wished them as well and all but Meowth had to conclude the song and the call so that brat till now was kept silent(laugh) so now says,’Meowth i’m hungery get the hell out of here or immediately fight(all laugh)’ so with that the call ends then Persy went there asked about me and Meowth said don’t you have a girlfriend(all burst into laughter) Persy was laughing and just told them 103 removed 2 chill(all laugh) and then a few talks and it was alright that pest is something indeed...”
Brock(laugh) : “that’s for sure man 11 and half years pestered me(all laugh) still after us(all laugh) and got me and Viol together to later use sentimental cards(all laugh)..no it’s just that people shouldn’t be brought anywhere just because they can even with protection as that was mistake from the Elite4 in Unova so now Kalos of all regions will be in red alert mood and will be forced to distribute money everywhere where true legal things are going on and he did keep his words for sure but that show(all laugh) and those peoms to the doctors there(all laugh) Dr Zyko realized what absurd pests have entered the hospital(all laugh) and he joked to us that only such people can successfully threaten doctors on whom their life and death is dependent yet make sure they are all alert(all laugh)...real meance everywhere(all laugh)...”
Violet(laugh) : “during phonecall he told me that i won’t recognize my baby sis(all laugh)..then i cried and finally did sleep as Brock went to the other room.then after phonecalls i also hardly selpt then woke up and then Brock eats me up first time ever(all burst into laughter)...and i return the favour(all laugh)...then call Ash,who most gently pats me goodbye for my tour(all laugh)..i go there then learn about all..then the huge surprize and whole perspective changes..even eavesdropped me here too(all laugh)..VIA Ruth of all(all laugh)...really best time those 2 days..”
Ash(laugh) : “well i told Dave after i got married and then just told him tomorrow a balanced man(all laugh) will go there as according to plans just my twin bro have fun imbalance your big bro(all laugh) and then went there with Trace as fox-bro(all laugh) and all tickled him(all laugh) then all those May called at night itself too happy to know that at Daristrum it was midnight(all laugh) so i said relieve your rose by vomitting aside(all burst into laughter) my sweet little sis was over the moon and although now the moon is as red as Blaziken(all laugh) and this time the shrew couldn’t come into any use in counting the call time(all laugh) as he was clearing up the voimt(all laugh) BY HIS OWN HANDS(all laugh) shrew was trying to play balancedly counted temporally perfect emotional lines card by trying to be a sort of proposal master Drew(all burst into laughter) i said part one only 2nd part vomits are still left only 50% INFATUATION(all burst into laughter) so Drew became shrew again(all laugh) then Harris and all i called from there and as many 100 as i could(all laugh) Sabrina was included(all burst into laughter) just told her only 1 Misty-girl-wife-friend for me since day one of my journey and her intuitions were right as usual(all laugh) just congratulated and said ghosts need vacations too(all laugh) then Mr and Mrs Maple later i said i lost my head and was about to lose my family so i’m so sorry but this and this and well they were informed instantly in the middle of the night when that little sister-pest screeched to them saying,’bro has proposed to Misty again(all burst into laughter)’ so was all fine and Mr Maple said why apology because the you thought the Balance wasn’t right that you used Solgaleo to Pyroar and Regigigas(all laugh) then told them in two lines that my bunch is universally known and they were battle staved during my Unova tour and then i was so much attached to them had to forget the whole world and those parties were relief for me cause i went there with the intention to talk pokemons and then the fans were in a beeline and certain accident happen and since then i myself was insecured as to Mist’s attitude to me cause she didn’t want to listen to me no matter what despite our 15 years familiarity to such intensely close level and then the break-up they surely know the 5 year antics was all the pain that went into obsession to hunt down anyone imaginable that tried to breech the professional relationship with me and my obsession reached a level that i could break relations with Brock and Trace and even May i could say bad words on her first anniversary all cause every relation except my mom soured so much in my mind i never wanted them and that is all about just was saved that Mist gave me another chance and we have decided to get finally engaged and all and i was sorry for visiting the gym on invitation yet behaving like a so and so and i was really sorry to which they were very happy said no it was alright just erase the memory just one year 13 followed and 52 to follow then said the grand grands won’t know(all laugh) and that was all
then Mr and Mrs Slate i called(all laugh) said that i was devillish to everyone and Brock is so much intrinsic part of my life he was thrown into a place from where only he could talk with me again and so on they were furious(all laugh) Mr Slate said,’shut the hell up!(all laugh) you have first spoiled my sweet little little liitle son(all laugh) and then again the eldest little one whom i thought to be more prudent still jumped into water with his bro(all laugh) what is it Ash with this water(all laugh) then Mrs Slate says,’WATER IS LIFE(all burst into laughter) then i again try to appologize and she tells me,’enough,enough(all laugh),the great rock told me in abstraction only(all laugh) that idiot would’ve still been standing at one toe on rocks in rivers even now(all burst into laughter)’ so i realized AH!BOULDER!BOULDER!(all laugh) then Foster was called(all laugh),’um..Foster,i’ve married Misty now and Brock has forgiven me for my behaviour..’,’yeah,heard it very happy we all are congrats and about Brock well you were professionally 100% ever which he must admit as well(all burst into laughter) so i realized this pest in irrecoverably spoiled(all laugh) then first and foremost Olivia was called cause i ever had all four of them in contacts but never called anyone except Olivia cause she is psycho(all burst into laughter),’um..hellow Olivia,Mist Ketchum’s husband talking,yesterday long date ring already given(all laugh) Tony will learn it as suprize by means of joke language no matter his or your feelings towards me cause i want another shot at the past just after what i’ve become at present so this also is an apology to you two that..’,’what is the shot(all laugh)’,’um..well,15 years with you and 13 with Tony and then suddenly due to ego i behaved like a monster and..’,’Thundurus(all burst into laughter),why did you keep contacts to begin with(all laugh)’,’um..i just wanted to not be told a certain name then and anything associeted with it but that name is the whole reason i’m sane still you surely know about..’,’the differentiation methods of bro and beau yeah i was mindfull at first bench(all burst into laughter)’,’um..no not..’,’the insinuations(all laugh)..Mr Ash Ketchum,crowd record master(all laugh) adds with that compalin of ignoranance at class with the note eat only-sleep wake-up repeat(all laugh)’,’um..look Olivia it’s..’,’psycho(all burst into laughter),you brat(all laugh) you made all of us too sad too long with your professional gibberish(all laugh) make me cheer up immediately only then Tony boy won’t pester you before surprize(all laugh)’,’um..thanks Olivia much thanks i just am speechless to have such..’,’psychos as friends(all laugh),man Ash stop these announce the news to your ignorant classmates(all laugh) and go to Orange straight(all laugh) BUT NOT ACROSS THE OCEAN(all laugh) but before that cheer me up then by numbers the rest and my hubby boy ever said what sort of pests first say you’ve beaten innumerable dragons yet are in self created fear from Unova and you’re afraid of me cause i showed 300 isn’t enough 912 might’ve been considerable despite being from Kanto(all laugh) and then after this pesters me to death for 2 continuous days swearing himself to hell(all laugh) by saying Ketchum isn’t Ketchum(all laugh) blood and sweat and ego and MATERIAL IS JUST THAT(all laugh) don’t bother about it it pesters me being this Ash Ketchum..really man what is it that bounds me to be Ash Ketchum and not Rotom(all burst into laughter) this form this idea of a boundary of being man shame on me man shame on me(all laugh) asinine is my name the epitome of that Tony just that(all burst into laughter)..and then when i receive still scoffs at at me,Tony you’re married now don’t be puerile in arguments(all burst into laughter) ask me whatever you want till you know i’m alive but except my personal life beyond me(all burst into laughter) and i told him same pests that ask me do you understand the difference between in the sun towards the core vs in the light at the moon hallucination differences when applied to semi middle Trevenant vs Dhelmise 2nd round 16 minute time limit set the time middle at your wish you’re against yourself(all burst into laughter) we both agreed that this sort of a pest is best kept at a distance cause we knew it’s only a matter of time before he returns to hunt down his Gyarados cause that’s the only food for both sides(all laugh) but Tony used to say may be Gyarados should look elsewhere in later days cause the pest was doing antics that weren’t sane for even sane Gengars not that of the pest’s own of course it was just kid laughs first time after 30 days of crying being away from home at kindergarten hallucination for him(all laugh) i said no that’s not happening cause the pest’s Gyarados says,your Unown Oliv was against his remember anyway(all laugh) man don’t let brats fondle you so much that you will get philosophical about public stunts as Brock said the outcome(all laugh),’um..may thanks Olivia and yeah Mist is alright the troubles were just me only waiting as you all know just asked for another chance so happy and all is cured that was just..’,’poposal lines(all laugh) got me and Tony married again today(all laugh) but don’t waste my time i’m PERSONALLY BUSY AS A PROFESSIONAL PSYCHO(all laugh) so what’s the prize’,’i see psychotic stuff(all laugh),so this idea of being Mr Tony Thomson’s wife as a state(all laugh),if before being born also was known then the biggest heartbreak to the very first date(all laugh),was already there included within hence never alone you and your soulmate(all laugh),and it was there because i know the steps up and down just was a play this call you damn psycho charges a rate(all laugh),ladies are emotionally more stable after that age hence only gents get suprizes(all burst into laughter),give me Irene’s contact rest i know this is a special sentimental case hence was Kaneonymous and bye(all laugh)..so Olivia psycho was too happy to stay mumb in the gents circle(all laugh) and Irene’s contact come up so i call cause it was a very serious issue(all laugh),’um..hellow Mrs Irene Cobter Halmsly,this is Ash Ketchum talking,Pokemon master,hall of fame..’,’Pallet Town my home where my sweet Mist Gyarados yesterday came(all laugh)’,’um..Mrs Halmsly(all laugh) i’m sorry but i..’,’never cared to contact you despite knowing it for 9 long years(all laugh) except you being fed by your husband(all laugh)’,’um..no look Kane i know since we both were 5 and then suddenly..’,’just drop these i know you married Mist yesterday how long was the date your friend was trying to figure out with his sister and moderated by her husband friend-boy(all laugh)’,’um..yeah took long ring already given but except you,Olivia,Brenda and Flavia rest will get surprizes cause you being you may give me a chance to atleast apologize properly..’,’ever the countering logic isn’t is Mr Ketchum(all laugh)’,’um..they are more emotional(all laugh)..’,’at this age as that’s the issue they now face which have against you already lost that race(all burst into laughter)’,’um..Mrs Halmsly,my behaviour(all laugh)..’,’is approved by my Noivern so bro vs beau hallucination is going on ATTENTION(all burst into laughter)!’,’no i’m fervantly sorry that i hurt you and Kane and all for this long but if they will get even more emotional so(all laugh)..’,’what assures you that except Olivia,Branda and Flavia i won’t(all laugh)’,’well the thing that i know about all of professionally cause well Olivia is in my profession exact but for the rest of you it’s rather an honour for me cause my knowledge is rather not of much use but the viseversa is too important for me and about the personal stuffs again i know Olivia for too long but the rest of you as well that’s from your husbands themselves and then they from you yourselves(all laugh) and in a manner that to me never seemed..’,’anything except Crawdauntogated(all burst into laughter)’,’um..have you forgiven me Mrs Halmsly(all laugh)’,’no(all laugh)’,’um..Irene(all laugh)’,’no(all laugh)’,’um..alright,alright i met you first 9 years ago at Cerulian(all laugh) and instantly realized you’re a too good friend of Mist then didn’t meet you during Sinnoh break you were out of station and then at Unova i wasn’t here i was with devils of my mind and so on but never contacted you cause you did since 9 years back(all laugh) and all cause even a doctor then you were a student still that gruelling 12 year course from 15 to 27 then 5 more years travel and so on till 32/33(all laugh) you still contacted me sometimes to know about my knowledge on pokemons diseases which is an honour really cause me..’,’is the one whoose pokemons never get sick and tired(all laugh)’,’um..well it’s just the care they get..’,’from the questions that they are asked everyday dawn to dawn(all laugh)’,’um..please,Irene i’m sorry for my atiitude towards..’,’me for 9 years so much that Olivia texted ONLY your contact the devil hasn’t kept what was that Ketchum(all laugh)’,’um..no it was just my inconvenience that if..’,’Brenda and Flavia wasn’t in the situation that i was given the whole situation with us and my sis-in-law and so on your great class mentioned to the whole world wasn’t attended by me(all laugh)’,’um..please Irene i’m so sorry that..’,’i first went through this great dense ocean made denser by imagination and most dense by abstruse philosophical reviews begotten from philosophers like Abomasnow whoose logic is unfallibale truely the urge to know is the root of all evils(all laugh) thus these made me to scoff everyone off especially if they were not males(all laugh) cause they are double edged as they aren’t of my gender then because my flower is unfortunately is of their gender due to the psychophysical despondency(all burst into laughter) thus they can rub her the wrong way(all burst into laughter) then i suddenly realized that my bunch is lunatic(all laugh) and jumped in Unova to get innumerable dragons and by then my flower was thrown into hell cause i wasn’t contacting her and saying she is nothing to beauty(all burst into laughter) sadly none understood it was more dreadfully the great Glalie(all burst into laughter) and she was hindrence to self travel beyond the psychophysical barrier which she refuses to recognize(all burst into laughter) cause she was thinking her hubby is sane atleast with her and not totally Tyranitar(all burst into laughter) then i somehow created gatefee records and then came back break-up was inevitable straight went to undercover where the psychophysical lunacy barrier was erased off by my Crawdauntogator representing my bunch and then i followed suit at Kalos(all laugh) in the meantime all my friends were scoffed off by me to stay professional strictly and never ask him personal questions but they were open to theirs and they were babysitted to this factor veiling the professionality and hence i also was no exception(all laugh) and my contact is saved as Kane which isn’t against the theory at all(all burst into laughter) and why i was there at the class was because what my friend’s hubby told at the very first meeting i will remember as Kane said yeah that brat is ever too dense beyond limits(all laugh),’no 3 time champ it’s just the bunch you see and the care that my people put in behind them,my job is to communicate with them but because you ask i will try to say what i do with them that is take Totodile for example(all laugh) he must be made aware of the differentiation of urge and will(all burst into laughter) he gets to Croconaw thus then he must be made aware of self and being(all burst into laughter) then he becomes Feraligator(all burst into laughter) then he must be told Croconaw to Totodile to Feraligator find a chain that surpasses the idea of confinement of existential despondency(all burst into laughter) he will then become most powerful cause his whole life teaches him to generalize himself which he can’t hence most incensed but mentally only that is which has to be assured by letting him share his mind with his master most thoroughly(all brust into laughter) this is my ideology and it’s just universal open to be used that’s all(all laugh) i realized this is the most abstractly cunning brat ever(all laugh) and thought as Daisy used to think too egotistical(all laugh) then Sinnoh was there and i was more experienced and Mist’s too much devotion we never got none did except Dr Gary Oak being that type of Mr Oak(all uncontrollbaly laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) and i realized handing innumerable Feraligators and Glalies and then looking at the venerable Glalie and Feraligator i realized these pests are HUMANS infact under mask of a fox(all laugh) so realized the the ego itself was the veil cause the main master who is universally accepted as a brat(all laugh) is a true pest to pokemon and public sanity(all laugh) and gets such absurd pests as Snorlax and Muk then Crawdauntogator(all laugh) who doesn’t get any sickness ever almost cause they scoff at doctors from where are you imported with this childish caring methods do you understand that at your stage of evolution according to our manual it’s not suitable to be emotional while self to self reflection of ethical morality in oneness of three elements pattern(all brust into laughter) none can treat them unless their trusted ones are there who are tormented beyond any limits each day with these ideas(all laugh) and your Sharpedo and Lapras tell me Mrs Halmsly,the water and the darkness underneath veiled by the sun above and the ability to swim here is all of the idea that this is me thus with age this idea grips you,Mrs Halmsly don’t you think this is rather a bondage of being anything else and not that and also the viseversa,Mrs Halmsly give us your your opinions on bondage and freedom in and of being withing the same for your safe passge out of water(all brust into laughter) so after all these i know the Gengar for sure as does Kane who says this happens when one forces philosophy on pokemons and expects they will review that to present better version(all laugh) congratulations for marrying your eternal wife once more(all laugh) and next time care to contact people personally cause all are old now(all burst into laughter)’,’um..Irene thanks many for forgiving me i surely was..’,’too much Mistyvious only to understand that she was of this world at this form hence this form is shared by others as well PSYCHOPHYSICAL THAT IS(all laugh)’,’um..no i also am sorry for my behaviour before out of professionality(all laugh)..’,’yeah i was served too with strange professionality after a days work i would call,’hellow Kane(all laugh)’,’it’s his girfriend here(all laugh)’,’um..sorry Mrs Halmsly for the mixup(all burts into laughter),how are you what may i do(all laugh)’..first it started with Mrs Halmsly to thunder-chair all insinuations everywhere with multiple edges to counter the psychophysical word girlfriend(all laugh) which your pokemons most aptly picked up both words and when and how to use them(all laugh) cause none is called Ms by them and singles are called by names that’s just namecall(all laugh) and then this was the first countering hurdle now to re recounter(all laugh) then the obligatory self contracting how are you was driven off the normal psychophysical plane to mitigate the idea of being by the succeeding what may i do each time(all laugh) and except the universal psycho(all laugh) cause the Gengarian philososphy say those who crosses the idea of gender by never uttering anything about it OR THINKING THEMSELVES OF BEING SO AT ANY MOMENT OF MUTUAL COLLABORATION(all laugh) is suited to become professional comrades never friends(all laugh) cause Gengars don’t understand that word it’s family or bust for them(all laugh) whole world is like that either you let me pester you beyond death or you’re just professional comrade(all laugh) anyway,atleast else were called by names properly unlike me or Brock(all laugh) yeah,i know that bit as well your Gyarados is too lunatic(all laugh) and both Brenda and Flavia also got this non-psychophysical abstract greeting(all laugh) Flavia atleast had the luck of being called Ms cause she was single then(all laugh) but most of the times by surname cause it atleast crosses comprehensive temporal barrier of spefic ideantity appearing here to the concerned as all conquering being being a particular psychophysical entity in wilderness(all laugh) anyway then after this long first step of of abstruse revolution against existential despondency(all laugh) somehow i aksed about certain things,’yeah Crawdaunt’s nature is like that they are incesseant but funny(all laugh) you may try to approach them by asking them of the darkness of the dark combinations of the mind as they recombines themselves to distrtibute themselves according to his will shining as the brightest light despite just being an appearence thus hindering the real dark nature that is the stepladder to the zenith of self establishement outside being so(all burst into laughter) and this will and the subsequent understanding of the very same will is which he decides and cogitates upon after the conference with his trusted colleagues is just his mind only hindering him in reality(all burst into laughter)..the real,real trusted colleagues are never the psychophysical barriers that he sees or thinks being existenet as real,the reality is he must realize all are like him and the viseversa thus only the funny nature comes out as universal brotherhood yet the darkness tells him it’s just him thus the whole phenomena of seclusion and the consequent cry of the urge to get out of this idea of self is about him as much as he wants it to be among others hence this path is equally shared and travelled cause all are Crawdaunts and the viseversa like his master(all burst into laughter)’..then i realized what plane this Gengar lives at(all laugh) and this is late Sinnoh(all laugh) then Unova when we were in total confusion i ask for Kyurem(all laugh),’um..yeah,you may see the towards the top of tree/the leaves move to the wind with so much glee/thus it makes me only so free/when i think i’ll also climb the ladder at the cost of thee(all burst into laughter) this hallucination if presented against the self suffocaction of zeal then Kyurem life is understandable as this means without the birth the despondency isn’t known in a way that it presents itself here so the trouble to conuter thus it must be questioned as to what is birth then at all(all burst into laughter),thank you Mrs Halmsly(all laugh)’...i’m remembering all these cause these were terrible(all laugh) and then under the cover then Kalos similar stuffs with Greninja(all laugh),the dark wisdom,Mrs Halmsly is an intriguing subject ideed it presents the reality in a despondant form then tries to make it funnier and happy and we may take the opposite root but the idea of confinement that is intrinsic to the being as confined has many visible symbols thus the mind goeas around to do what Greninja is upto but on the contrary as well which Greninja is more afraid of thus the grand equilibrium is in the idea of the lack of ideas that is this being this shackles this misery is best reversed as what is the idea to be out which is seen as the freedom and if that’s tasted then the preceeding all is useless so to be there the path is imporatant but being an idea only it blinks as the one that gave the birth to it this illusion of self alone in the middle of the indescrible that Greninja struggles with is best relieved by asking if i’m so where in seclusion and then if no seclusion where is peace cause in bondage theres no peace so a Greninja tries to mitigate the understand and mitigate the idea of the one existence itself by countering against it with the indespensible wisdom that the being and the becoming and the repeatation is only constant thus there’s nothing at all except what is ME(all brust into laughter) hence they get self-tamed,thank you(all brust into laughter)..’..so finally at Kalos the ELOQUENCE was there(all laugh) and i know very well what Greninja actually does and her master pest says she does(all laugh)..i told Kane what is this(all laugh) he said these pests have been bron to irritate people beyond all imaginable hells to compell them to admit that they are in reality pests as well just a matter of expression(all laugh)..and by then i had to walk on razor blade path cause both you and your beloved Gyarados was waiting to chew up everyone for no reason what-so-ever(all laugh) she said,that press conference Irie,bro and beau(all laugh),used to tender me like anyway(all laugh) and i knew what the pest did with her a normal person would’ve been totally mad if the pest broke-up what to speak of this once ever absolutely lunatics Gyarados(all laugh) and she hadn’t been alright but now surely are and do you have confusions regarding beauty(all burst into laughter)’,’no all were met by me have you heard of Gengarian philosophy in Palkian lie detection while travelling as mental Salamence(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,i’ve heard and also Giratina and Ultranercozma was entering civil rooms with poems(all laugh) but why the wrath after knowing everything(all laugh)’,’no Salamences went to meet me at Unova HQ of all places from where they were illegally trasported back cause Kommo-Os were getting too happy(all laugh) and the rest is rest certainly there were honest ideas everywhere there and all circles cause at the end of the day we all are in the very top levels at our professions to begin with that requires a bit of honesty in true ethical standard of honesty(all laugh) surely as Guzzlord says you might know(all laugh) so it was ok and Daisy only wanted that her baby sis gets a good family not playboys(all laugh) but not one or 2 but 3 time champs suddenly jumping the ship that too at Unova of all places and then at the HQ itself which has 360 dragons of all types each atleast one league champ(all laugh)..’,’yeah the illusion was that deep but the Tauros said,who is dancing to whoose tunes at all(all laugh) so that illusion was too quickly cleared and 360 dragons did the rest(all laugh) but now to the utmost misfortune of us Gengar,Palkia and Salamence together jumped in the freshened pool and hence we’re shown the reality too to our most inconvenience(all laugh)..’,’yeah little kids(all laugh),anyway,but i’ve not been nice to..’,’Hana and Victor and Sarah and Brauch and the whole world(all laugh) why cause i was lie detecting on myself(all laugh)’,’um..no really Irene it’s just that i wasn’t sane really during that 4 years(all laugh) and..’,’none can be when they let wild pokemons to fondle them hours after hours(all laugh)..’,’um..no it was just the adjustments(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah when is the ceremony(all laugh)’,’as soon as she agrees to end the honeymoon(all laugh)’,’never then contiue(all laugh)’,’um..no to all of you i’ve been a demon according to me but you all don’t seem(all laugh)’,’man,still you have confusions as to how you’re perceived Ash(all laugh),we’re most concerned for your well being cause we know you’re not sane anyway with pokemons(all laugh) and that is now reflecting to the whole world cause with humans your Mist glass is missing(all laugh) don’t bother we all know why a person like you whoose absurd answering makes everyone to become so jovial no matter from where they are talking(all laugh) and yeah reflection and relative distance has also been remodelled according to dragonic manuals(all laugh) and hence we know you’re just a too Mistyfied Gengar(all laugh) and she is spoiled beyond any limits since day 0 anyway(all laugh) who called you my hubby day 6 still at Viridian(all laugh)’,’i see it was you then on the call(all laugh)’,’yeah,except for yours truely none understood the Gyarados properly to that extent among friend circle in personal life(all laugh)’,’um..yeah,i realize but um..Irene i’ve never been kind to you despite knowing you’re my most dear friend’s other half for 10 years now(all laugh) and Mist’s friend for 25(all laugh) so what may i do at this instant cause you must’ve heard about my endeavours overnight(all laugh)’,’yeah most certainly you owe me a lot and to all else but me the most(all laugh) unless you cheer me up i’ll break the ground immediately to spoil your surprize and mind it doctors don’t speak this much unless it’s Gengar calling(all laugh)’,’yeah,thanks for understanding me(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,right carry on(all laugh)’,’well this one is from my Shiftree then(all burst into laughter) who agrees on this with me so this one he tells me to tell you to cheer you up,’things seen as against the taste/things felt ever of distaste/i will revolt against all these to be(all laugh)/what i really am to get that revolt will be from me(all laugh)/thus i revolted against this despondant state/my revolution revolted against me to get me to this fate/that it’s not fate at all that whatever i see/from my most dear to the most loathed all is just me and me(all laugh)..thanks Irene for patience and kindness(all laugh)’,’with Shiftree(all laugh) i know what that pest actually says and what his mater brat does(all laugh),been at the labs umpteenth times(all laugh) bye and i can understand what Gyarados will do to you after just the beginning last night(all laugh),talk with Hana and bye(all laugh)’..so the little pest was appeased(all laugh)..SHIFTREE(all laugh)..then Flavia(all laugh),’um..hellow Mrs Styris,this is Ash Ketchum talking,pokemon master,hall of fame,Kanto’,’Misty Waterflower Ketchum’s husband for 19 years yeah(all laugh),’um..look Flavia you’ve heard the news i was hardly sane in my self created illusion i turned on..’,’myself(all laugh) as Feraligator,please Ash,don’t bother you didn’t behave well all knows that but that’s only personally never professionally even in dreams all knows that too but so do ghosts(all burst into laughter) exactly why people adore them no matter the manuals(all laugh)..Braum was insinutaed as so and so in profession only for the same person to mortify himself in the most absurd way by saying when a Salamence preys a certain fish or something snatching it away from it’s family or like that a break-up scenario(all laugh) the flesh and blood he enjoyes consider my existence as represtative of Ash Ketchumhood(all burst into laughter) being more loathsome to that scene as i’m worse than that feeling of revulsion in my own mind(all laugh) then Braum said i was compelled to talk with him after 2 days of heinous self torture propagated to me(all laugh) then still chided me saying are you dependent being or self what makes you happy being Braum or self as self(all burst into laughter) so he said these sort of pests are not budging to call me to or from the next world to discuss philosophy as it appears to my Salamence(all laugh)..don’t bother Ash,we know very well what you actually are,we’re overjoyed that the ghost will enter all our families freely being coupled now(all laugh) and about the marriage well costly that proposal is i told Braum(all laugh) so that was personal prize enough to fulfil 4 years and then i can never forget the discourse on turning against own self at a moment when i was so confused with myself i asked you a question on breeding and you said,turning on something is that idea of existence of that thus the idea isn’t turned against unless that is what is the want it’s ok only in appearence the reality is ever the target being that idea cause that is only the cry of the deprived only so cause of this idea in central core of the idea of another despite not the need of self which is satisfied in evolutionary processes(all laugh) only alone but the others are reflected(all laugh) anyway,cause that very idea of another comes of spontaneous self expansion when we set a limit to it the derived joy is in need to be shared to only test that very limit nothing more thus if that is turned against then the troubles there are no more hence it exapands to that limitless and each moment is of happiness(all laugh) cause there’s no limits as there’s no fear of the other that’s the psychophysicality of the being a illusion upon the ever free self thus no reviews in the evolutions of Totodile as the full to Feraligator attracting the others only the right the real Crawdaunts(all burst into laughter),thank you Ms Flavia(all laugh)..so i was too overjoyed to hear that and ever knew what a Gengar you really are(all laugh)..so don’t bother congrats but i want a prize like Olivia got as the leeway of being a psycho(all laugh),’i see so happy to have such great people extended family really too close to call friends those 4 are and you the same in relations anyway Braum will get the surprize from me and your prize is just Rayquaza(all laugh),written in the dragonic manual was what i am/i’m here matching that question comes is that all that i’m/whoose manual who writes and who follows this thing/thus lets define all again to be the real being(all laugh)’,’i see Kalos mastery(all laugh)..just congrats and best wishes but your manualed friend is going to have difficult times today again bye(all laugh)..’ so that pest was safely queued to replace Brauchy-man(all burst into laughter) then finally Brenda girl at Harris inn(all laugh),’Mrs Allstrub,this is Ash Ketchum talking,pokemon master..’,’just cut it Ash,Brock called and Olivia texted congrats to you and your Mist wife 19th time(all laugh) but from where did you read those(all laugh)’,’um..no just my illusion forced my heinous behaviour and hence was desperate attempts to get out of that thus had to go though many things and..’,’no your discourse really was too universal for your browned grass’ safe passage today(all laugh)’,’um..no,Brenda i’m only happy that you both were happy hearing that but what i did even with Harris and you as well..’,’no,no don’t spoil the effects(all burst into laughter) go back to your wife cause she’s desperate to hear more(all laugh) and your professionality of Gengarhood was enough for us to realize the Mist that you need to become personally stable(all laugh) don’t worry you translated your Trevenant to me by telling me to close the eyes to see the right hallucinations to pick out the wrongs(all burst into laughter) that wordplay was enough for me understand how many edges each counter had in absurdity(all laugh) and Harry said yeah,ever too dense,after break-up once a discussion came up on Celebi said Celebian life is about seeing things clearly by understanding they are unclear to being with(all burst into laughter) thus the way to maximazine the Celebi you must question him what is it the the idea of un and not un actually mean if they are contrary in meaning to each other why do they exist(all burst into laughter) and his Celebi replied after getting lunatic that why bother to begin the process of progress if regress only is being contrasted(all burst into laughter) regress despite not so which is why being bron is the trouble cause then you think this cause it’s not that(all burst into laughter) and so you see,today says this tomorrow will ask you about Chimchar(all laugh) which you did but the question was on Markrow(all burst into laughter) the most loathed pokemon here at Kanto villege-sides(all laugh) so this all is fine we knew who wanted to be a Markrow so badly and is now(all laugh) just congrats but give the surprize to the grass yourself(all laugh),waiting(all laugh),’well,thanks Brenda many many thanks for understanding my positions and i’m so overjoyed to have people like Harris and you and the rest with me no matter what so your prize is just Ultranercozma(all laugh),so many things around me ever the false the true/everything i have nothing i have no matter having myself i’d rue/looking around thus questioning everyone and self/found out the thirst,quench and desire again is just the fraction of the joy of being no being which is my real self(all laugh)’,’yeah,i see eloquence(all laugh)..best wishes for your well being but your friend won’t be alive today,bye(all laugh)’,so all the pests were fed ELOQUENCE(all laugh)...so then these proves how sweet and simple all the four soulmates of my 4 pals are just that family AH!BOULDER!BOULDER!(all laugh)..Trace do you understand why you shouldn’t have jackaled around hours later with worng compliments(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “yeah,i guess(all laugh) but man they only got the polite version and you all too but that day that one hour with this lunatic 107 alone(all laugh) and the glory to follow of psychothrombonosis,false alarms,who closed the door at which moment(all laugh),beautiful beauties(all laugh) and what not that was some day man not forgetting in next few lives(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “AH!HUMAN!HUMAN!(all laugh)..anyway,then back to the philosophy boy patch-up period(all laugh),so then later Harris son was called exactly when he is the busiest with the grass-group training start time(all laugh) like this,’um..hellow man,can i talk about my personal life(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah yeah 4 years double drama(all laugh) congrats for your performances 1250th

laugh) runaway with her to your Unovan dragons BUT WITHOUT THEM(all laugh) catch a plane there not those pests(all laugh) and don’t return before a year good bye(all laugh)’ then before him Tony boy

laugh)..told you to just shove that namecalled Giratina down her throat(all burst into laughter) don’t keep that brat during honeymoon ghosts come out of pokeball statistically quickest(all burst into laughter) and then that’s a dragon psudeo-legendary meance and you are entering civil roms with another similar brat named Ultranercozma to add to the dish(all laugh) whole city knows why you came back no drama of head hunting was necessary the names of your beloved brats INCLUDING YOUR OEN ILLUSION OF THIS PRESENT BEING(all laugh) were enough as soon as they entered the City’s air we knew the sinister was here EMBODIED(all laugh) and you’ve also opened the Olivian key even more with those words now(all laugh) so yeah wish me luck i need it to be alive(all laugh) yeah and sell that gym off

safe and professional till you know the time(all laugh) later sent a humungous mail(all laugh) only one in 35 not in psychophysical plane hence the result at Cerulian,stay as you are as you’re anyway too happy(all laugh) and the curtain till senor helps it and she will cause isn’t one to sit around doing nothing i only hope doesn’t become a trainer or something far worst experience will have then(all laugh)..and Clemont was happy later said yeah in Unova(all brust into laughter) i wrote back pray to all hevens(all laugh) these were in emails(all laugh) which were too frank in abstraction(all laugh) and Megan too talked in phone or something then fed her with her hubby to Mr Oak Mr Oak(all laugh) but back to phonecalls,then again Cili(all laugh)..Cili(all laugh)..cause Cili disturbed me in the morning and now enjoying his time(all laugh) so the damn brat was summoned(all laugh) ‘Cili sweetie Zekromling(all burst into laughter) won’t you marry me now that master rejected me(all laugh)..i cherish you so much for 5 years before you confessed to your wife what happened to our promises(all burst into laughter)..’,’yeah returns the favour now(all burst into laughter)...if you want to be happy ever shove that Zekrom down your sweet NivyGiti in a triagle immediately bye(all uncontrollably laugh)..’..Cili(all laugh)..WHERE’S KOMMO-O(all laugh)..don’t spoil kids(all burst into laughter) and all are ordering Yamask(all burst into laughter)..that brat is something,then before these called Max of course who was hellbent on testing my methods(all laugh) but that was some experience indeed(all laugh) he was as well screeched at full Torchic scale in his ears midnight damaging his hearing aparatus since then(all laugh) but all were also philosophically treated as well(all laugh) i call Max and say,’um..Mr Maple(all burst into laughter) this is Ash Ketchum,pokemon master..’,’hall of fame just call me Max but if that model is to be followed..(all burst into laughter)...’,’no Max wait surely i’ve not acted as i should’ve rather..’,’no no it’s ok i understand the emotions(all burst into laughter) you yourself used to say all time it’s ok but that model(all laugh)..’,’later(all laugh) but no Max am i still acceptable to you as your big bro cause..’,’as a big bro you were getting into a phase of your life that as a model is very intriguing(all burst into laughter) but was very hard for you to follow(all laugh) and hence the family suffered a bit it’s just emotions as you know best(all laugh) nothing to be given any thought to cause they make no sense as they change all time so no you’ve always been our family me included and always will just a misunderstanding nothing else but this phase of your life as a model if i follow(all burst into laughter)..’,’please Max just get rid of this model(all burst into laughter) May called me big bro after 20 minutes of familiarity and to her that was very own flesh and blood relation and then i went to your home and Mr and Mrs Maple immediately made me their very own son and you instantly took me as own big bro as well and after all these all of you have same relation too as soon as i just remembered my roots though only only by creating a fiasco at Cerulian but Drew called a few days later as soon as he heard it just my action of rememberence was enough to all of you including him to tell me that my little sis and he is expecting their future and my little nephew or niece singular or plural and it’s from that day itself i knew that no matter here i wanted to lose my family there with all of you you didn’t ever and that much is the validation of the model that neither you all nor my family here nor Mist my wife now she is none came to me and accepted me for a reason but exactly for the lack of it and hence i’m just speechless in joy really and my close friends are exactly the epitome of that sentiment as well so i’ve ever have had everyone that were my own really my family the most that is your model i was forced into it by certain situations which may the infinite compassion ever intervene a person from getting into no matter who what to speak of my own very own dear family and friends and you are my little sweet bro just forget that stuff and that’s cause God forbid even if you do face any of you face you won’t be doing the mistake i did by turning on myself that is surely cause about emotions i ever spoke but surely couldn’t manage when the real test came i’m just happy to be myself again with all of you really out of the model it only proved what i already knew the suffereing that i faced being inside it i only distributed to the whole world as you sure know the press and all stuffs that was the only gift of the model nothing else so really Max just forget it you and all of you are way stronger than me emotionally hence don’t bother about things please just let it go and tell me about your life and your your soulmate(all laugh)..’,now i tell you all these cause just look at the reaction and you will know why these two little pests sis and bro both are too sweet to the very core to even understand that i was apologizing(all laugh) says,’yeah i understand your plight otherwise neither you nor Misty were persons to suddenly get indifferent to everything like that and i’m so happy like all to have you back and congratulations on your marriage to both of you and Misty you know ever my own big sis as well so happy to have her back as well now officially as my big sis-in-law so yeah all too overjoyed but the model(all laugh) is indeed nice it seems(all laugh) if could be handled in diffrent ways or may be not(all laugh) and yeah my girlfriend Mia is swelling substance and physical suppliments specialist you may know 3 years it’s been our relationship know her for 5 was travel companion at Johto later though that(all laugh) but 3 times the more in years(all burst into laughter)..’,’another honeymoon will do it for 5 times the infinity(all laugh) just forget the model or else i’ll set dragons upon both of you(all laugh)’..then it was normal talks and all same thing(all laugh)..then from there itself me and Gary made Trace call Hector and after the second time Trace was in need of drinking vapours back(all laugh) i had a little few words with Hector and then Mr and Mrs Skechit talked with Trace to get him 3 down in salt(all laugh) and we forced him to take salt mixture(all laugh) then Trevor was told as well and a few 100 professionals known to me(all laugh) which after i knew that i was going to abduct my flower also included Danny and Rudy(all burst into laughter) cause the brats were disturbing the Elite4(all laugh) both said they were hellbent to see the end of the novel(all laugh) cause the characters were intriguing(all laugh) i said just the welcoming subplots shifted midmatch to increase the tension(all laugh) to which they said unless they are given the recognition they will involve Palkias there(all laugh) but then it had to be the greatest drama analysts(all laugh) office was summoned via my lackies(all laugh) and the men were present there so got them and just said yeah drama shifts to post marriage part(all laugh) to which men congratulated us saying the better half title was only half revealed for the sake of the drama as according to the 2nd command’s ideas(all uncontrollably laugh) but again warned me saying the longing wife card will be played as the pro of longing(all burst into laughter,Ash hugs Misty very quickly,Misty smiles in same pose) tries to keep me confined in the gym according to the acidity levels on the particuler day(all uncontrollably laugh) and now that you are with the Gyarados after a long time you’ll be easily trapped allowing the teacher to learn from student with a open heart to use this sentiment to obstruct the gentleman’s overnight duties(all uncontrollbaly laugh) and the 2nd command will rub the Gyarados each day by using the expression card for the Gyarados to hold a sway over your water duo(all uncontrollbaly laugh) and will be using the in law sentiments to lull Brock into dose your bunch sometimes to get the drama going(all uncontrollbaly laugh) and the pet is laughing now cause she can hold sawy over the Gyarados’s acidity swing to get you under control lulling Mr Oak to shift his focus away from your bunch to the gym so the water duo along with Solgy and Yevly and Tyranitar especially gets to rot there while the Dwegong gang enjoys the best free care as you pay the double duties along with Mr Oak’s charge which will be cajoled out of you by the expression card to then divide in-between(all uncontrollably laugh) and the Gyarados will try to go to jewlerry shop each day to buy a new sample using your money only under direction of her 3 advisers to distribute 4 and the rest three will be burgained among each other and the unfortunate loser will turn on her husband to force him playing sentimental tricks with all of you and then you all plus he too will have to buy the unfortunate one the biggest furtune(all uncontrollably laugh) so yes the Gyarados will hand you over all her earnings to play the expression card later to hold a sawy over your expenses all to get your bunch down and the 3 sinisters will try to get a monthly income from your income only not the Gyarados’s income so that you’re forced to use the Gyarados’s money to make the expression trick work hand in hand with the acidity level(all uncontrollbaly laugh) then finally i said yeah always great to know the thinking process behind different drama plots and financial strategies(all burst into laughter)...so the most beautiful men turned out to be the greastest comic relieves by analysis of the ulterior(all laugh)...”
Daisy(laugh) : “this drama is something of a different level Ash as we’re seeing you with the nests(all laugh)”
Ash(laugh) : “much more to come(all laugh) anyway,after all these go so well you know half an hour at Pinkenberry and go to Unova then all this but then after i return and finally in the gym(all laugh) that has been another story indeed for the last 8 months(all laugh)...well then that’s the 37th evolution but the next part Trace see you in Kalos(all laugh),bye then later again but only in Kalos(all laugh reciprocate bye and all)...BUT I WILL FINISH THE UNOVAN CILI NEXT TIME CAUSE THAT QUESTION OF EVOLUTION BROCK IS JUST SO NAIVE(all laugh and bye..etc)..”

...........................................................................................................................................................
(8 days later,night)

Ash(laugh) : “well today the remisiscences will end and Daisy’s question to look back the soulmate show in detail takes two to three months(all laugh)”
Daisy(laugh) : “and Lugias(all laugh) and those dramas(all laugh) and pawns and Tyranitars and what not(all laugh) great experience each time and yeah the 5 years(all laugh) but nothing like 2 words(all laugh) that was something but the drama(all laugh)”
Ash(laugh) : “then that show with Elite4(all laugh) and my bunch’s commentary in every situation whoose whoose beau(all laugh) but my personal favourite is the toffee-flower at home first time ever(all laugh)...”
Gary(laugh) : “hmm..(all laugh)..count-a-ring(all burst into laughter)...hmm...(all laugh)...”
Tracey(laugh) : “and SO GLORIOUS(all laugh) never forgetting those man what a day that was(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “and the tricks to get your soulmate trapped(all laugh) and those songs(all laugh)...2nd command’s work has gone to the bay(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “cause it’s all so naive(all laugh)..familial(all burst into laughter)..”
Brock(laugh) : “no this brat has decided to pester me into next life soon(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “and Mist flower how’s your complain to Mr FeraliGator(all laugh)..”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “processing..(all laugh)..today faced a Mr FeraliGator(all burst into laughter) no chance too shrewd(all laugh)..next a Mr Crawdaunt(all burst into laughter) couldn’t win either clever hallucinations(all laugh and .)..but both draw(all laugh) last one the challenger won by confusing my Lapras with Mrs grounded-Seismitoad watered(all burst into laughter) and also his only water psychic dark(all laugh) in first region 6th  badge from Tokensburg,Hoenn started with Totodile next Corpish got(all laugh) then got the combined plan to get Palpitoad 3rd(all laugh) only 3 waters(all burst into laughter,.) but his 3 strongest(all laugh) asked me in details about water pokemon specializing(all burst into laughter) cause the rest only 8 are too thoughtfully unevolved balanced humans(all burst into laughter) and heard this hall of famer this morning was again reAshed to be naive(all burst into laughter) so the draws were distributed according to plan to get the feeling of win to the most ENJOYING(all burst into laughter)...same will happen to you(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well that is pretty true about things getting ENGAGING(all laugh)..and after last weeks 3 days lab stay the weekend trip to little sis was good so today the mood is much better(laugh,all smile,Ash quickly hugs Misty and smiles at her then back to same pose,Misty smiles at Ash in same pose)...well the dragons does what for us is amusing and Charizard wasn’t disturbed this time(all laugh) it was Giti on Mist and Ultranercozma on me then we were on Dragonite who’s as fast as others(all laugh) and so Hydreigon on Mist and Latios on me Rayquaza in role and Zekrom and Garchomp as usual on two subtle subtles respectively(all laugh) and Rashiram was on Hydreigon and Yveltal was on Latios as well and this time we had no support for Dragonite so that brat was told to stay at one evolutional lecture(all laugh) support was that Rayquaza told Dragonite that he doesn’t know dragonic evolution thus his troubles(all laugh) and that brat had to bear it cause that was concentration for 65 long minutes(all laugh) later turned on Rayqaza for 260(all laugh) then we go there had only Staryu and Starmie and none of my brats(all laugh) but those brats Gyarados and Jellicent is pawning Mist to get me(all laugh) then shrew fled home(all burst into laughter) just met us and said finally after 3 weeks chilli some chill nights(all laugh) was blazed out to enjoy more(all laugh) but then quadruple women burden fell upon me as both old women were lying beside the little women as younger sisters(all laugh) but i asked May why of all Blaziken(all laugh) was sobbed that neither her hubby nor her big bro like her(all laugh) great vacation both Mist and May could relax a lot and Drew most(all laugh) all at my expense(all laugh) literally too(all laugh) and shrew came next to next day finally returning to see us off much later(all laugh) fed the brat most neutritious food possible(all laugh) the two sweet little dolls are doing great so that was nice experience there two nights but before i go through with Ciliolution(all laugh) why don’t i go towards the future and try to predict what is the next chapter for them cause i don’t want to not be in only in past(all laugh) mind there’s no present(all laugh)..so with best wishes i’ll start but i told bro that there’s every chance that with your over the edge TV interest(all laugh) and the Lab with Zara’s laws(all laugh) my prediction is straight in Elite4 battle analysis(all laugh) or might start a starter lab herself(all laugh) and the naming ceremony was also today when i was being questioned by Zekrom if changing all guards means i’m planning my honeymoon with her(all laugh) asked me to talk alone(all burst into laughter) it was phenomenal stuff said they don’t think i’m weak don’t you cherish me(all laugh) then asked the brat what bugs you then took me aside(all laugh) showed a hallucination of Lugias attacking and she was weak so didn’t cherish her(all laugh) and i said no don’t bother about spoiling them unless they directly flamethrow(all laugh) i told Reshiram to eavesdrop the Lugias and that brat poked her saying you need to be weaker(all laugh) that means get ready(all burst into laughter) then i summoned and chided each brat cause all were thinking of battling by turning the Lugias on each other(all laugh) so then after that the naming was to be done and i named her as Olympia(all .) that’s the name of the leader at () psychic gym in Unova(all laugh) Dave himself was there too happy with this name cause she is a famous name all over for obvious Davidian skills(all laugh) and Zara just sweetly said cute name(all laugh) and then the rest will be with time(all laugh,Violet burst into laughter and Brock shakes his head laughing) Dave and Zara both too eager for predictions(all laugh) and i said absolutely similar to Gili she will be cause first only 1.72 years difference plus the lab then Dave in one way and Gary in another too excited all the time(all laugh) so both are definitely doing the same thing but i’ll say it when i talk about Gili who might be able to talk next month or the next very close(all smile) but my wish is that he says DARK_RRRAAA_I(all laugh) but then my sis was told one will become solemn metaphysician(all laugh) another nasty gym leader(all laugh) cause gym leader is the battle-reddened untimed(all laugh) and metaphysician because the shrew doesn’t any Drews(all laugh) told us that man we’re uneducated(all laugh) i said just Venturiastrog Mr Skechit knows well(all laugh) so that can be the case cause with both loathing any authority that much no way both will get in(all laugh) so i said well like a researcher or something may be and then Mr Maple is in final 2 years from next month,he called me today if i’m free(all laugh) i said definitely if he can get Max battling again(all laugh) and Max and Mia already says you must be the teacher(all laugh) in illegal swelled up breeding(all burst into laughter) with them i told them no way training or contests either spcial type trainer or lab or breeding anything(all laugh) and the regions are everywhere cause of same(all laugh) and just before that Gengleye was seen off as confirmed leaders after a weeks trial and finally special vote(all laugh) Crawdauntogator is happy to lose it cause their men and the viseversa are the 2nd command Violet sis(all laugh)...”
Violet(laugh) : “which makes the most cunning expression(all burst into laughter)...how’s the sawy position(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “the pet is who swings to prolong happiness(all laugh) Yveltal and Chu(all burst into laughter)...Chu is the once ever extremely cunning brat(all laugh) you know all are happy that he has given up the seriousness(all laugh) but to the limitless as well(all laugh) he is the propagator of that prolonging plans art(all laugh) Crawdauntogator had that but the logic is stronger now(all laugh) Chu is Yveltal and Crawdauntogator in one(all laugh) told me like many years i was idiotically battling(all laugh) but now i’m not so the more one breaks the sweat the more is the end day pay(all burst into laughter) means more food and especially drink(all laugh) the more the wait towards the goal the more is the joy(all burst into laughter) the more master brat stays away from 2nd brat(all laugh) today the more will be the impatience(all burst into laughter) this brat is extremely dangerous all world is about art of starving(all laugh) and his final statement is always about what master brat wickedly plans to do with 2nd brat(all laugh) or the viseversa and how master brat counters that to get the 2nd master do the honours(all laugh) and with Yveltal’s pursuit this is once ever stuff(all laugh) and Magmortgolem is all are moling against all personally to professionally recruit moles(all laugh) these three new imports are horrible(all laugh) Mime is there too and now Muk isn’t there much with Professor max time outside so Mime looks after Professor more but you all have seen since last three months they all are extremely intelligent and now with Lugias around almost like humans they are(all laugh) and our gym brats are extremely cunning(all laugh) in the art of challenger lulling(all laugh) Gyarados and her beau both spoiled(all laugh) as is Jellicent(all laugh),Goldy remained the same he just wants to fool around like Gengleye so battling is like that as well(all laugh) but this brat Kyogre is extremely dangerous brat and totally spoiled(all laugh) but how’s the pet sister(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “swinging between deals(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “and the ever teacher is the philosophy2 now with other recruits Glalie is shifted to lecture Trace,Guzzlord is lording over all place to detect moles by boring them out(all laugh) and Nivy is lecturing all but especially the ones that has to set up the tricks with soulmates(all laugh)...age related(all laugh)..so finally the teaching head(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “the teacher will spoil your flower properly now(all laugh)..and buy jewlery each day riding the jackal(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “well one needs to tell them isn’t the light a bit bright here(all laugh)...but here now the lecture is going on as Mr Skechit for 18 years hears every time(all laugh) standing in the bushes without the swing(all burst into laughter)/jumping into ocean with Marill will be reuing(all laugh)/thinking of action first why not do so after doing(all burst into laughter)/Mr Skechit your actions with Venonat and Scyther should be not humanising(all laugh) this brat sits on my shoulders as guide to the whole world as the world of sky fights(all burst into laughter) and Talonflame whole flight shows how it’s wrong(all laugh) what a 20 and 20 minute journey that is each day and at that pace(all laugh)...so then lets Trace march on in future tense(all laugh,.),so my prediction for Gili will be a trainer cause Magmortgolem and the rest,Dave bro is here(all laugh) and then all of us even if we give philosophy books will want the implementations to be by say starter Pichu(all laugh) will make him too thoughtful(all laugh) and i guess with you two a very balanced man truely(all laugh) not human though(all burst into laughter) no if like Lance then it’s just so much better to have moles at Elite4 hotseat itself(all laugh) 1st Kanto – not win cause with all i think will be lost in specifications first year(all laugh),2nd Kanto Frontier- win,3rd Johto- win,4th Kalos(all laugh) -win..with all that he will hear will be hard for him not to go there 4th if not first (all laugh) but whoever goes to Kalos first or even if separate at same time if i’m here i’ll defintinely join in for some days in the penultimate months(all laugh) no if Gary and Lillie is mixed with all these and he will have his own personality and all i think definitely that balance is all you need in Kalos,then 5th Orange-win,6th Unova-win,7th Hoenn – win or toss ,8th Sinnoh – toss or win cause might be longing then(all laugh) either will be won with blind eyes(all laugh) but another the level of prolonging(all laugh) so 6 leagues i guess sure if come here and continues and does whats needed and all then i’m hopefull for a 7 here at Elite4 for same reasons and it’s not a toss cause longing will have time to be settled(all laugh) no even if single the philosophy will be too attracting(all laugh) then with such characters just this or any other competition somewhere will be too attractive(all laugh) so then a double bunch of Mr Oak Mr Oak and Mr Oak(all laugh)...”
Gary(laugh) : “will shove the brat down to set-up farming as mole lackie(all laugh) naively though(all burst into laughter,Brock .ly laughs)
Ash(laugh) : “Lillie pet wig sister(all laugh) Pichu or Azurill(all burst into laughter)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “Ketchum i’ll get rid of your 37 years down the way if humans(all burst into laughter)..”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “then he’ll sweat..(all laugh,all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “toffee-flower(all burst into laughter)...right(all laugh), but that is legend taming Dr Muking’s Jackal method gently foxing(all burst into laughter) AH!HUMAN!HUMAN!(all laugh)..that is something(all laugh)...so then comes Blosie and Jas and as i said with Alice and Alissa same age so one will become human(all laugh) 10 battle-hardedned dragons cause the training will be in Unova(all laugh) after Kalos(all laugh) so the other to me is a full time professionally practising gym leader(all laugh,.) my logic is Trace is human and Daisy has enough skills in battling minus the fondling(all laugh) perfect for gym leading but one will be human(all laugh) the Cascade successor will do Kanto and Orange of course then i think Johto as well with Mist’s influence and than all this but i will if i’m present want her to do Unova and get a few damn Palkia and Kyurem in(all laugh) and then the training will be Unova cause it’s hard there(all laugh) and no trouble what-so-ever with other cares as we have Cili(all laugh) so no trouble at all there then about the travels of the battle reddened one(all laugh) i was asked of course by the whole world to specify right order of region selections(all laugh) especially Unova and Kalos(all laugh) so i said well Hoenn and Sinnoh is enough and then Johto that’s great and for the metaphysician one(all laugh) i said same just send her to Unova with Ms Skechit same age will be fine under Cili(all laugh) or if the reddened one wants to battle in training and the other becomes gym leader which can be then the gym leader is same and for reddened one it must be like
1st Hoenn-lose too reddened(all laugh), 2nd Hoenn Frontier- lose too calculative(all laugh), 3rd Kanto-win,4th Orange -win,5th Johto -win,6th Sinnoh – win,7th Unova -win,8th Kalos - win then in Elite4 i say 6-1 toss cause i only recall Persy and Dave(all laugh) the 7-0 is Lance stuff(all laugh) but hall of fame definitely and the longing or singling will be fine with Blaziken there and then the great shrew(all laugh) but about Blosie and Jas atleast one is guranteed to become human to me(all laugh) and about Olympia i guess similar will be to Gili if come here but will be more like Katy pretty balancedly biased towards the battle part(all laugh) so for her i say and i don’t assume that all of them will want to travel together rather would want to compete(all laugh)
1st Kanto – lose too interested(all laugh), 2nd Orange – win, 3rd Johto – win,4th Kanto Frontier – win or lose might be a overconfidence factor there like Dave himself had he barely managed his 4th and couldn’t win the 5th at Orange and with Olympia the 2 back to back league with one approach can do that quickly,5th Hoenn – lose or win toss same reason but atleast one is won,6th Sinnoh – win surely(all laugh),7th Unova-win assuredly(all laugh) Dave would’ve had a great great chance had it not been for TYRAniTAR(all laugh) and if two similar such Madgaleos(all laugh) draw all the way can’t separate(all laugh) no matter where stays in 2.5 years(all laugh) cause if similarity detected they won’t attack at all will be mental games like they played among themselves(all laugh) but it’s not happening in next 100 don’t bother(all laugh) so then finally 8th Kalos – win and then lastly Elite4 6-1 or 7-0 toss and then Elite4 HQ(all laugh) either she or Gili is going there in HQ(all laugh) and the other is in compettition for sure and HQ as personally professional moles(all laugh) and for her longing or not is no trouble cause immune(all laugh) well Dave on hearing this says any chance i too can join(all laugh) i said next term yeah(all laugh) and then Zara says that is moling while at top legal(all laugh) me and Dave both in unison said Jasu(all burst into laughter) that was something then May says no way they will battle as much as you did i said no unlike you(all laugh) and shrew says still man the education(all laugh) then me and sis in unison hi fived saying shrewd(all laugh) but no whoever wants to go into research Unova is best place for training all agrees and breeding well Max and Mia both are there though Mia is illegal business specialist(all laugh) and then Cili is there all too easy in terms of guidence and about special type training just the same as gym leader travel or even to understand that that is your interest same like Harris is a great and true example of even realizing it quickly and then shifting the focus but whatever Unova is must for all no matter what(all laugh) so that was something more(all laugh) but Daisy how about Corpish and Totodile(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “i’ll teach Ulterior(all laugh)...”
Tracey(laugh) : “no hope of research if those are starters(all laugh)...but AH!HUMAN!HUMAN!(all laugh)..but i’ll not be gentle at all if they become beautiful(all laugh) especially at Kalos(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “they’ll be but you can’t catch the cunning(all laugh)..dad!um..he said..um..like you were mom’s second cousin(all burst into laughter),dad!don’t disturb me i’m at my home only bye(all laugh)..CONHOOPA(all laugh)..and then finally there is the gym leader(all laugh) the MAN(all laugh) the man asked me to name the man i said Violet has been script writing and composing songs for eternity(all laugh) why me then Violet said the familial issue(all laugh) so the he who is coming i named as Casper(all .) first the name meant Violet ate me up(all laugh) then my Mist flower did the same later(all laugh)..yeah(all laugh) then i got Steelixed(all laugh) and the rest jumped me(all laugh) then finally Mrs Slate(all laugh) says good for water as well(all laugh) so a cunning name(all laugh) Gilbert is as usual intellectual name(all laugh) so the other half gave the name to be countering(all laugh)..right(all laugh),so Casper is double edged name(all laugh)...my sis said Alice and Alissa is exactly the Drew-May pair the first is more calculative the next reddened and hence the names Mr Maple gave(all . and laugh) great choise with the words both girl names yet great and the Olympia was selected as being best in psychic games(all laugh) which appeased Zara too much(all laugh) that means kinda like who has mastery over many skills the lawful any kind pokemon trainer(all . and laugh) so the duo was too happy but i and Dave both did liked the name for the gym leader part(all laugh) later i thought then after giving told them(all laugh) and we both have very good contacts with her(all laugh) and i told her today(all laugh) too happy and all is 58 now like grand daughter very happy(all smile) Gilbert was given by Mist which is bright promise a pefect for Mr Oak and the pet but also the pet and Mr Oak(all laugh) perfect name and Blossom was given by Mist as a word of her love for Daisy that is Blossoming love and care and tenderness and gentleness but then human(all laugh) Jasmine was given to mean gentle fragrance which suits her and though her dad was dedicated that name it can be given to all but only can be dedicated to inhumans(all laugh) so that was the idea and for Casper i will say will be too all rounded and hence the name(all smile and .) so i guess we have a big chance of another Professor Dr Casper Slate chairing the Professor Samuel Oak seat(all smile) as for travelling i guess he’ll want to do the opposing so Kalos travel as trainer for 2 years first region and then Kanto for the studies and all i don’t think that will settle for one direction like us but like Professor will have a way vast base of skills hence that and for all you 3 my bros and me and all of our soulmates we all agree for all of us and our stuffs we might have reached one particular position or virtue to at most but overall Professor still remains the idol for all of us hence the name especially given my first badge as well as the travels and the Mantine classes that i’ve had(all laugh) and for longing or the lack of it self management will be with other cousins cause here much help is difficult naively as expression(all laugh) so that is the name so finally just for a couple of words(all laugh) so that i go to Unovan Cilian(all laugh) Mrs Violet Slate...”
Violet(laugh) : “flamilial happiness is enough for confirmation that you’ll be again eaten up as soon as we see you tomorrow again(all laugh) and familial cause that assumes that someone naively will follow for him to be alive(all laugh)...”
Brock(laugh) : “this brat will not allow me peace of naivety(all laugh) and a great name indeed we just hope and wish for the best but lets begin Unovan Ciliution(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “yes best wishes to all and then to Cili(all laugh)..Cili(all laugh)..well Unovan Cili evolution is i’ve spoken too many times of(all laugh) and yeah the start was that after 2 days of vulture killing finally each of you understand that the 5 years were like illusion thus not to hold onto that at all cause the very morning after discourse that jackal was trying that trick(all laugh) then the empowerment process and all then finally i go to Pinkenberry and i had the full dragon group as usual and water bunch just had Palkia and Sharpedo and Mist just had Gyarados and Azumarill(all laugh) then i go there and ask the dragon brats what do you want(all laugh) Charizard says you’re engaging me too much away from Charla i can’t properly plan my approaches with sudden activities(all burst into laughter) i said well atleast stay for 2 hours after pokecentre to return freshened(all laugh) then the rest were to pokecentre for resting and Mist had Glalie and me Deoxys as personal protection(all laugh) Deoxys tells Glalie that your beauty is changing though is same(all laugh) i don’t change so whoose beauty(all burst into laughter) to which Glalie says,this exact statement is beauty cause you understand it(all laugh) and so on Deoxys is taken cause psychic group was unhappy after all there years of ghosts getting preferrence most times cause thay can tickle in a particular way of planes(all burst into laughter) and Deoxys had to be with me whole time when i need cause he revolted(all laugh) said the feeling of tickling changes according to different brats(all laugh) but i stay so who is getting tickled(all burst into laughter) that means ghosts tickling are their illusion(all laugh) so the brat had to be there and i was there just after the first initial 45 minutes after final check in had about 40 minutes got the snacks and all and yet to start eating and Mist finally wifed up so will now feed me herself(all laugh) so just as she started a couple of minutes or 3 call comes Trevor the only persons that could call me there was shrew(all laugh) and my sis,Dave and Zara,my mom and the Elite4 heads even you were threatened to not do that(all laugh) and Professor himself threatened you(all laugh) and Mr and Mrs Maple as well as the big Torchic threatened Max cause that pest was wanting to learn both our methods for simulations and of course Mia only was more interested(all laugh) and only you all know that contact now only Persy and his beau know the new but so does Boulder(all laugh) and sadly our Morris family(all laugh) so then call comes Mist must be shown who it is i show and her face totally turns dark just patted her and went outside and Trevor says you know ()  was the whole reason for me to go and first news comes that 60 legends a Capexil was there as head(all laugh) i said well i realize but what about the rest of the gym staffs said ok just psychic injuries but would recoverable but are you too busy(all laugh) i said mate you know none can tame a Capexil without the proper preparation and i proposed to my girlfriend after 5 years of no contacts just 3 days ago and she was depressed for 5 and i’m surely busy atleast give 20 days says max 7(all laugh) i say well then there a month says never faced this is situation in last 200 years and this looks to dwarf it by way far(all laugh) i said mate 60 legends may be they have 60 more first they need the lure machine then the rest where’s the damn head who is selected each year from that committe system since 5 years are they helping now(all laugh) said 5 men yestaerday went to test a Raftosmoric and a Dispoptas(all laugh) these names made me fell off cause psychic names fine but Dispoptas and Raftosmoric means whole region is under threat and yeah both were there(all laugh) Dispoptas is number 3 and Raftosmoric same and in bot sides they had 4 to 7(all laugh) so 10 damn brats fire and electric were roaming around(all laugh) and so on then i say well atleast to get my bunch ready i do need 9 cause the rest two days are to fetch them and register the marriage so that the ring remains atleast and so on and by then my bug was eavesdropping me by hugging me(laugh) so she tried to snatch the phone away but looking at my disposition desisted the tradition(all laugh) cause the very first night i told her and she herself knew a little that Unova is legendary now(all laugh) and then tells me the details and i told Mist the reason i must accept and spent another hour there to console her and then myself call Trace cause first Gary and Dave would’ve straight went to Unova to the labs and the spot and Brock would go to the Elite4 quarters with 22 Steelixs(all laugh) and then Trace said fine but talk with Professor who says 7 days impossible atleast get 4 more if not 7(all laugh) i said no you heard those names and Zengstrog and so on are there and then i said a Capexil was there but a Seseptricustrog too is seen(all laugh) then Professor said no you must go no matter what but tell them to attack the fire and electric and rock and human all types(all laugh) let the brats die and then send them to labs including human specimens as seals(all laugh) just get the psychics off cause they tickle(all laugh) and Professor were right cause with me Butterfree was enough(all laugh) then i settle things down here my brats were as usual saying the grand plan to stay away from that 2nd brat to increase the starving(all laugh) and so on and then all is done registry office then Sabrina is called they barely knew anything and said same let other types rot(all laugh) and even i called Blanie said haven’t you seen a copule Dispoptas’s evolving(all laugh) Blanie said i never understood their infatuation of not getting a lure machine themselves(all laugh) i had one and 2 came(all laugh) and the very first experiment under my tuteledge and not all by me(all laugh) success and gets to idiots just tell them to call the fire brigade again(all laugh) then i call Mr Maple saying a Ybalakamanust is roaming around with a Gigantabisformat and a Kakarobastril(all laugh) need to find moms cause are abducted so i’m the guide(all laugh) Mr Maple said as well just the psychics don’t get involved with their illegal beaus of both kind(all laugh) and then among my friends none can know and no gym leader must be called but Sabrina i’ll call anyway and Blanie could be called cause he is the only man to see off two Dispoptas’ by calling general fire govorment from the spot(all laugh) Lance was contacted as his silence flustered me and Lance said that same thing the psychics but said don’t know what the rest are going to do all on Trevor cause Kanto is in their best form in last 60 years of mine now the Lugia down so even more(all laugh) don’t know if i’ll be able to hold the office at all or not or Simon () news came and same day the last few registered with the anarchists cause their arms weren’t getting legal(all laugh) i was very sad i said i involved you in personal business he said no that was ok there problem is your omnipresence(all laugh) so then finally i go there after having to alert mom which was the bigger hurdle for me than any legends including myself(all laugh) made a deal at Mist’s cost then only could go(laugh) first went there saw that all were trying to backstab the neighbour(all laugh) Persy of all people were at charge of two chosen regions like Kalos and Unova and i said Persy each of atleast 230 had the termination system what’s the gurantee Persy was really depressed said the bottom line or what(all laugh) then i said i know Nigel will be with me in Kalos except you and Samantha but i don’t trust anyone else there i saw the office and know the brats there and also many at gyms and all so you should build outside defence and stay calm don’t try to jump till they reach you home or office or your family and close friends cause he was all ready to be my co-guide(all laugh) and then Samantha was there(all laugh) sees me and says lets go(all laugh) i said please calm down i’m hired for a reason you know my brats too well(all laugh) was angry why this shackling,we are seasoned pros and so on(all laugh) i said please calm down i will only go to the spots the background is way more important the second battelion that is(all laugh) so happy immediately told Persy get ready(all laugh) Persy was laughing saying you told me why i’m petulant(all laugh) i said yeah feed the family card on yourself as well(all laugh) then Nigel and Munro i met there and Nancy by phone they said yeah more than vote just don’t disturb him or his(all laugh) then there was no preparation and i get a few battlers but i sternly warned them not to disturb my bunch and let theirs not to do so as well and then the other few but they were not the team rocket preparation and were at bay finally before going under by spreading across region(all laugh) all were given translators(all laugh) and told them just protect yourselves don’t release one brat of yours unless my bunch demands so to increase dance partners(all laugh) they said man thay aren’t humans(all laugh) i said fine see the very last sample forcing me to get her to get sampled 1 year and 5 months back and see the state(all laugh) Incineroar life in making the colours of things that are around you see this phenomena of could physical colour,mental colour,emotional colour(all burst into laughter) so what is this colour is what disturbes my mind this colour if you want to discolour to colour what is the right colour of you as being discoloured hence the colours you search in colurs by discolouring that very colour then what is the actual colour(all burst into laughter) they said yeah realized but what if she tries to teach us later(all laugh) i said no she only wants girfriend(all burst into laughter) so they realized that and then i said protect the Kalos border well atleast and told Trevor about Mist and then the re-wills again to establish Kalos in bottom line even more(laugh) and then finally before getting in i asked them if i could call once just one personal contact here my travel companion who is from Unova and this adress last i talked and all in Unova knows Cili more or less in many professional sections and Jane has a way more than just good name for herslef too but they said that no Mist won’t be dragged and just the 1st month that too not on spot unless she wants and not in Unova but i said i know my wife and her nature will first thing go to the spot all by herself without much informations if alerted about me and will try to come here at HQ without absolutely any preparation(all laugh) if such case arises won’t listen and create a legal mess and torture herself unless she has her ways so a confident is the way to stop her and thus i got a the again 302nd Cili..Cili(all laugh)..Cili was totally at bay cause all they heard were legends and so on and then i just told him that look this is covert stuff and you of all don’t need to be told what a close friend does in any situation no matter what it may be just if your ‘mam calls 24 times everyday and namecalls the whole world including you and you wife specially(all laugh) or comes here like a 16 year old kid in ponytails with just her Gyarados,Golduck and Starmie(all laugh) atleast handle her well cause there’s every chance that she’ll do it next month itself don’t get surprized and don’t call her unless she does ever(all laugh) Cili is all over the place cause he thinks i must be serious especially she knew about the future but i was laughing(all laugh) i said i’m the fuel behind the show by all means(all laugh) and doesn’t run in inertia at all(all laugh) so then i had to say that mate listen you know what a Dispoptas is more than me be serious there for one moment next time you wake up you’re in next life totally fried by all means(all laugh) and so i can’t be serious even if i want and then Gengleye tickled him to show neither are they of course(all laugh) and the influence is rather the viseversa(all laugh)..and so then this all is set up now all we are support crews and me their leader not their(all laugh) each says why are we brought here seriously(all laugh) better be girlfriend this time(all laugh) why you need a second battelian we will turn the beaus against each other(all laugh) that brat Chu and his chosen beau with mom brat(all burst into laughter)..yeah that’s their pet word for anyone cause they tell them to be serious for one moment atleast by calling them by their names(all laugh) and mom knows that as well(all laugh)..Bulbasaur wanted to return ultimately as none other than the Lord said just an ethical issue of immoral anger in honest unintelligence(all burst into laughter) but Muk didn’t want to leave saying Bulbasaur is too serious will spoil my thought process of hugging the self as self not in self(all burst into laughter) so somehow the brats were sent but Feraligator as usual later turned out poked the Magmorters saying only budge if Bulbasaur gives you a match each(all laugh) and of course the moles helped(all laugh) and Crawdaunt chose the chosen brats all over the lab to imbibe it in opposing way so that all budge to Bulbasaur cause the other is too interested(all laugh) and Muk only helped Bulbasaur by saying i’m old enough to know all skirmishes are fake to show off in the dates just shut the namecall up and pester Bulbasaur(all laugh)..only when i or my bunch didn’t return in their own specified time did they get agitated later Lord was summoned who said too honestly unethical(all laugh) and Bayleaf faced the other buffoon with Dispoptas said as usual all cause of hunger of mental kind to be happy without a cause(all burst into laughter) this means when natural state thus Dispoptas budged cause before that Bayleaf said yeah yeah i’ve a family i understand kids want to complain if hunger and turns on each other for the food share what are your participations and experience cause you seem to not know them as you don’t understand the basic principle of fighting of not fighting the jovial..Dispy are you hungry(all burst into laughter)..these were enough and then the Buffoon jumped Dispoptas being Dispoptas burnt him out but not only mentally as Xormnuh,Hytotsohurakanom and Capxexil did but a fire dragon is a fire dragon(all laugh) hope next time that brat comes after understand this anyway,that goes then the group is divided and all then we search for the 4 buffoons(all laugh) finally after hide and seek and meeting at a few events from where they fled and i would never chase after anyone nor my bunch that is not our nature plus a trap that is and so finally the buffoons and i meet and see 100 still didn’t know the best duo and i said nice to meet you under the greed(all laugh) they say Mr Ash Ketchum how’s the famed honeymoon now i said well she’s not alone you see(all laugh) then they say only one i said i debuted with a few max swelled Lightenthunstroms with infinitely more intelligence you see(all laugh) then the conversation can’t be said(laugh)..right(laugh,all smile) and then finally they say the worst retard with the worst retard faced the Muk that we see are you sure i said well atleast was retarded enough to admit defeat like we do and should didn’t they then this continues a bit then they say challenge i say if you spread across and i don’t find you after you tell me the spot the 2 general governments are here surely no legend wants that right especially if Kalos is involved too intricately(all laugh) they said so confident aren’t you i said unlike your legends who are only so confident in doubting you(all laugh) and so on then finally after that session challenge accepted that they will call me and my 10 group with 10 and i only am allowed to have two i said i choose the disticntly weakest duo Giratina and Zekrom(all laugh) and that was that Zekrom was irritating me whole time but she was a comic relief(all laugh) and Giti is Giti(all laugh) i asked Zekrom can you go to Sharpedo’s former home(all laugh) no i’m weak so he didn’t allow me but i cherish him so much(all laugh) and so on was going i realized that if need be Zekrom will try to electroculate the whole ocean(all laugh) and that’s my Lightenthunstorm max normal+4(all laugh) one of 4 but is most incesseantly mad if need be in weakest(all laugh) hence surpasses Lightenthunstrom normal mad max by 4(all laugh) and Giti was telling me how every moment my emotions were changing and what a reminder he is you know in such situations where you must be jovial and cool and calm(all laugh) but this all later my bunch was there to see the picture all 107 did and i asked Guzzlord who volunteered to give the discourse in honesty(all laugh) of ehtics(all laugh) said ethically these brats with their beaus honestly must’nt take more than 10 minutes in their span to get immoral at first date(all burst into laughter) so why didn’t we get the brats then and there Feraligator said master brat is an idiot else they could’ve recuited moles there itself(all laugh) i knew these buffoons no matter who was left by no way is even be made to break sweat(all laugh) as of all the epitomising great Tyranitar said i want electricity as well the water doesn’t boil in fire properly in quickest time(all burst into laughter) Solgaleo opined with so many types those idiots will take 1 minute to turn them against themselves being born(all laugh) and after all Yveltal asks are you happy(all laugh) cause those seemed to be unhappy so definitely they want beaus but doesn’t doesn’t understand that illegals get that longing quenched more(all burst into laughter) and so on goes then Bulbasaur and Muk is managed to be sent back via Kukui lab and i went incognito and still many ghost psychics hid me and all then finally i get on with Zekrom and Giti for the first 1 month and a bit more then we encounter all legends see Hytostohurakanom and so many more and Giti scares him away by boring him(all laugh) and others get Zekromed(all laugh) and finally after 2 months before end see Xormnuh who with other legendary beaus gets type specified in thinking(all laugh) i was with Kartana and Bronzong then(all laugh) after first 2 months the plans were redistributed(all laugh) and next two or three weeks all changing and all then finally that final comes and i wake up in hospital after 6 days and Goodra jumps me first(all laugh) then i get the picture the doctors were at bay and then i feared termination and Crawdaunt and Palkia were not there somewhere near only Noivern was there with Goodra and the Persy comes i get some hope but those newes that my Mist was dragged through hells like that with that devastating personal loss for both of us and then Cili comes says yeah ‘mam did what you told but was polite(laugh) and didn’t come here i said yeah right none knew of that situation except Trevor and he only told Persy after he knew the loss and then dragging her through was wrong cause it wasn’t an abused one by any means and then those systems weren’t provided and all and even her demand to have atleast Brock with him wasn’t paid any attention to incensed both me and Brock and Brock fought a brat finally after may be 3000 years(all laugh) and Swampet as usual too agitated so did what she does(all laugh) and then of all people they foisted sentimental ideas to Mr Oak Mr Oak who was anyway chiding his own bunch which action he is regretting now(all laugh) and Daisy when Blosie and Jas was in advanced stages of preparation before coming to us meant jackal had a hard time(all laugh) and even Violet wanted to gym battle with Mantine following Brawn(all laugh) and no really if Violet is angry and fought Mantine can become the steepest rock to surmount(all laugh) but Violet fortunately doesn’t stay in that mood longer than a second no matter what(all laugh) Trace had a real hard time then with Daisy and his two other sisters and then Mr Oak Mr Oak goes there at Unovan beauty parlour with Tapu Koko and Dusknoir where none knew who is the other(all laugh) Cili was not allowed in many places but he handles Gary well fortunately(all laugh) and Cili now says that mate for once i thought may be in desperation you will return to Huntelion(all laugh) and no i feel sorry for the whole world if a 30 strong Kommo-O gang roams around too happy in wilderness(all laugh) cause they will punch to gauge if you really are happy(All laugh) so then finally Dr Zyko comes and i get the assurence and then that news was predicted but not confirmed yet and in the meantime Gary went there first then Brock then Brock stayed and Gary went to deal with Orange(all laugh) that news comes and all then finally the termination etc were going on Lance wasn’t there forced him out with Simon,Trevor lost his mind,Orange was all over the place,McShin got the revenge cup special(all laugh) and then Ivana went crazy,Kalos suddenly decided that not then but now is the time to wake up in the Bottom line by pulling it a bit lower(all laugh) then finally it had be Jasu Jason(all laugh)..Jasu(all laugh)...that man is a unique sample(all laugh) then Dave did what he could to get that order cancelled in a way along with Yohan,Grub and a few of my great mates there and Jack fooled around with Jasu(all laugh) to get the brat distracted enough to just abstain and not add insinuations to that(all laugh) then Johto thought someone was calling them out of dream inside the dream so they jumped in,Orange was so beautiful(all laugh) and of all places Kanto Conference Congress was alerted(all laugh) only to be shrewdly handled(all laugh) that is first they were lulled into eating the spicey food of why there was a shared ribbon system then to begin with(all laugh) then why i was allowed being a one time champ(all laugh) to which Mr Maple added that it was so cause my sis was allowed in gyms thus the Congress was generous(all laugh) then they vomitted saying illegality was hidden by Mr Maple himself(all laugh) and again that 3 draws(all laugh) but they were shrewdly redirected to clean that up themselves as they were told atleast Drew was free to travel Unova and he has some knowledge of dragons with a Flygon and a Dragonite and his wife will happily lend her Altaria and her knowledge of her(all laugh) that meant a couple of Kommo-O were about to enter the judge’s seat to ensure all sorts of draws(all laugh) and finally Mr Maple contacted the rebel group in Orange to empower them that atleast he and his few friends support them and thus Brock was spared from rematches(all laugh) and Nigel,Munro and Nancy was always there with Persy,Samantha abstained but didn’t do anything else was very honest with herself else who faced me was divided but none infact belived fully in my bunch as to how they can do things totally independent Samantha just wasn’t decided and she did the right thing cause Persy was under suffocating pressure and then Dave obviously first wanted to come with me(laugh) then with Mist(laugh) both of us turned him down so he became emotional 2nd time after marriage(all laugh) and turned on the whole world and so on and then Tony boy with his Oliv psycho wanted to jump at Unova of all places cause brats were challenging me when i was in hospital(all laugh) and Braum wanted to support them(all laugh) their grand plan didn’t materialize all the three says why not we weren’t family so totally free to get a few hall of fame samples(all laugh) i hushed them up saying i’m in no need of battlers for me to prove that i still have friends and family cause my 4 illusive years has made them think i’m an inhuman roaming around all alone(all laugh) don’t both stay mumb when i get out of here they’ll get ConHoopa first(all laugh) then Kane handled the Pallet weeds of all people(all laugh) along with other pests as well and Mrs Slate was too happy to battle again(all laugh) and Harris was calm and cool cause Brenda was agitated by Braumy manual,Tony boy and Oliv psycho(all laugh) and Flavia was in Cynthia position cause her hubby was too overzealous and mentors were too cool(all laugh) then they really helped to get the Frucient gym done with Harris so and Tony boy with Olivia took care of the gym while Braumy manual looked after their vacant posts(all laugh) no really all of them the 8 greats(all laugh) really without them i’m not complete either as i’m not except Cili(all laugh)..where’s Kommo-O(all laugh)..and so unfortunately Professor was ill which only aggrevated the situation,mom wanted to enter Orange league with Mr Mime(all laugh) which could’ve fetched her the seniors league(all laugh) and then the gym was anyway under construction then the Frucient gym which didn’t help McShin(all laugh) but then Mrs Slate saw that off with Kane getting the lab works done who told McShin the importance of right dates(all laugh) Olivia,Tony and Braum were mad as well mostly Tony said mate 20 electrics no matter the legends or hall of fames atleast one would’ve been sent away(all laugh) and of course mostly doesn’t include psychos(all laugh) Olivia said yeah i’m too cunning and well rounded as well feed me each hall of fame brat(all laugh) and fire legends(all laugh) i finally had to tell all that legends can’t be tamed by legally fighting them without preparation and if they are Xormnuh then you can’t fight at all cause they do mental battle exactly what my bunch specializes in(all laugh) cause they are so(all laugh) and then they said then anyone can(all laugh) i said if by luck the trainer and the bunch and the methods and so many more factors in psychic behaviours and opponenets and league schedule and experience(all laugh) and so on matches only then the whole bunch can get spoiled like they have(all laugh) just a fluke of history hence all this fluke of 103 rarest legends being captured..but if they mingle with my bunch then there’s a chance given some factors but much less in number(all laugh) to which they say well we’re customers at oak lab as well(all laugh) but our bunch are kept aside(all laugh) i said for good else they will call you master brat giving us substandard food each day forcing you to undercovers(all laugh) then they said yeah may be next term(all laugh) anyway,then the news leak they are alive at Kalos cause it hasn’t gone beyond the two hall of fames and now Persy being there and Samantha it’s not going at all and Nigel also was there all time as the others,Nigel ever had one thing said ask my Thundurus if you can(all laugh) but Dave throwing his weight around now really helped me to get my way and Dave himself did the right thing by getting what he more than deserves and all then Mr Maple normalized the Hoenn bunch lastly(all laugh) and the leftovers were abjectly Torchiced(all laugh) and the final was played impersonally to rocket greats that clarified the undercover stuff and they were sternly warned to return to their girlfriends or else they may have to tolerate a day in the life of a chosen Mewoth(all laugh) and that was it then finally i return and that day was something but the gain is that 2nd battelion has created a most unique phenomena please welcome once more now in final form Magmortgolem(all laugh and .) professionally personal dually unhappy professionally thus personally happy to mole professionally(all burst into laughter) and Gary shouldn’t be happy to be a dual type now cause he doesn’t understand the 2nd master enough to personally deal with her giving her the professional space to swing(all laugh) anyway those brats are better not discussed tomorrow is the grand meeting for us to finally test those two brats and also the Lugias later sometimes the sisters will be invited during my stay there with Misty flower sister whoose my wife Mist minus y(all laugh)..right(all laugh)..even on that marriage day Ash why are you calling me Misty(all laugh)...right(all laugh) and only at last night hours when those brats are at their most sinister(all laugh) then the whole case was still on with the expansion till then though only very very few remained 3 or 4 and Dave was at my home then not completely remodelled but i was at lab after Dave and Zara ate me up in advance(all laugh) then finally the day i return here to my new settelement inside lab first my Mist flower jumped me too much sweetened in ponytails and totally drenched my dress(all laugh) then mom re drenched the dress rather than drying it up(all laugh) then that brat Mime was trying to fool around to get greatly chided(all laugh) later told me why so serious(all laugh) Chu thunderbolted me(all laugh) then irontell(all laugh) cause i looked serious(all laugh) and then Trace came in and took Chu and Mime out to field and then i had to lecture my mom and wife on all sorts of most dangerous situations(all laugh) then all else jump me at lab including by already returned bunch who said wheres girfriend(all laugh) those were most idiotic brats(all laugh),Dave was emotional again 2nd time in life(all laugh) and then my sis was trying to appear through phone(all laugh) and other friends and all i first here contacted Sabrina and told her finally made the passage home she was very happy said stay there don’t leave again in this life unless the general government invites not of Kanto(all laugh) and Blanie too i told Dispoptas had to like us(all laugh) Blanie said only waterfire from now(all laugh) and then most beautiful men(all laugh) via Gym contacted themselves just a few words and all told me how my flower suddenly appeared there to get them into safety mood by dragging knives(all laugh) then saw Chu and realized it’s about Palkian life(all laugh) so did what they were asked to told me before infact when i myself contacted in offices via sources that just the ponytail was missing cause Chu was there(all laugh) then Mrs Maple said so great to fool around with authorities and kids after 15 years(all laugh) and Foster beaked my head of after few extremley touching words as to why rock legends weren’t there due to which susbtances(all laugh) and then the dramatists later said creating the anti-drama isn’t the way inside drama it must be cunningly positioned like the pet always gets in(all laugh,Lillie bursts into laughter) and so on then Max said um..why Mr Green isn’t interested in telling me about the places where the legends stayed and Mia added especially all supplementals used for especially Ybalakamanust nice name(all laugh) i said just buy a few nice novels(all laugh) then finally there was SPEW(all laugh) i said see what infatuation does to personal life(all laugh) shrew said that applies for you only(all laugh) get rid of those questions for a couple months atleast(all laugh) then my four friends here and their other haves were eating me up i said saw twice in two years too much emotion this is why at Huntelion Kommo-O said life is hard(all laugh) then i pressed Cili as to tell me about what Unova is doing with him and Jane for being in my support and others like Mrs Olympia,Mrs Jolum and so on they all said you just enjoy your life enough with your Unovan infatuation(all laugh) i said yeah Kommo-O shouldn’t have refused me(all laugh) they said may be they are serious in punching after all(all laugh) i said yeah then i should be away(all laugh) and Jane was too sad when i asked that i had to cheer her up saying just asking if i can help said,Cili is cunning enough and i too am pretty old(all laugh) and Cili was threatened so he said yeah too much bonhomie isn’t it(all laugh) personally talk with your Elite4 then at Huntelion to set the Mark right(all laugh) so i called the great Mark(all laugh) and asked him being straight from Huntelion do you have any idea how to distribute the dragons(all laugh) said yeah my Kyurem was excellent in electric gyms as well(all laugh) but not suspicious(all laugh) i said yeah they will say the same unless you sort the gyms out as they were or should be(all laugh)..then finally had come to Cerulian(all laugh) then our Sarah and family eats me up finally(all laugh) i tell them just the beginning such is playboy life(all laugh) and the rest fooling around Mist restarted after a month i’m all retired and the whole lab is now huge and changed and Dave is doing great with that grand competition and he with Zara and their coming future is there at my home which now completely renovated each place,Mime is finally again mixed a lot lot more in lab after 21 years(all laugh) as mom happily agreed to go to new settelement inside the lab itself with all of you and restart her accountancy classes after 11 years(all laugh) and Chu then has now decided to stay there most as well as Starmie and Staryu are ready for professional protection personally(all laugh) and Chu finally realized none wants to break sweat he was unnecessarily wasting his time(all laugh) so now settled in gym and immediately spoiled himself(all laugh) and my sis is so good with my little nieces there and Shrew is as usual vomit cleaning sort of a Drew(all laugh) and i’m so happy with my nephews and nieces and more to come here and all else here you 6 pawns(all laugh) and then little little bro Max and his wife Mia(all laugh) and Harris,Kane,Tony and Braum the 4 musketiers and gurdians of the city(all laugh) and Jane and her little son Zion with 301st Cili(all laugh)..Cili(all laugh)..Cili is something really(all laugh) and all are very fine and all else at Pweter(all laugh) Mr and Mrs Maple too very well and happy and healthy and also everyone including Sarah and family too finally very very happy and well(all laugh) and the most happy the Cerulian City(all laugh and .) so all is well for me to enjoy retired life with my Mist wife(all laugh)..right(all laugh) so the question of evolution takes three months to complete(all laugh) and yet so many things still hasn’t been spoken of 21 years AND BEFORE(all laugh) and next time the reminiscences will be of and from only the most experienced in varied situations the jackal(all laugh) and i’ll do the calling(all laugh) well then see you suddenly anytime across it for 1251th badge

(9 days later morning,6:15 am,conversation)

Ash(laugh) : “firstly,from last hours of yesterday to today is too eventful as soon as i return here just after settling down call comes to my phone Iris Arrisu Garcia(all .) i receive says hi and all then her husband Fedinand Garcia from Hoenn itself 2 time grand conference winner Hoenn and Kalos of all places(all laugh) 5 regions travelled barring Kanto and of course Unova(all laugh)..Kommo-O(all laugh)..they have settled down married 3 years back as Unovan Cili told me(all laugh) she went to Hoenn took 2.5 years to get the title and Ferdinand also the same then both decided enough is enough and now in profession Iris is doing great with junior trainings and all that and Ferdinand same with contest systems and all but i’m so happy to that their future has arrived in the name Kyle as their son couple of months back and that to had to be on the day of the show soulmate(laugh,all smile,.,) yeah knows about the show well all do(all laugh) and then Iris being Iris the outside enthusiasm and zeal has gone in so studying and watching all sorts of battles(all laugh) even now and infact talks about that with little Kyle(all laugh) and so on hence i was summoned as it has suddenly appeared to her that no this isn’t Gengleye(all laugh) but 300 gym badges weren’t enough(all burst into laughter) herself too overjoyous says was going through legends and my activities that are all public now(all laugh) suddenly a thing has come upon her i could easily do 369 but for them did 300(all burst into laughter) i don’t know may be some discussions or something just too happy says now i realize the full picture of your life(all laugh) i said well but i also went under the cover so blank(all laugh) i said just went there just after my break-up after Unova and then time has send me everywhere for last 6 years i’ve married Misty as you know(all laugh) i’m sorry never contacted you after undercover i got lost in my head says it’s ok mutual termination only can result in mutual re-agreement(all laugh and .) so then had a chat and Ferdinand is a very nice guy had good chat said you were a mystry to her(all laugh) i said yeah pretty understandable i dragged her through 300 hall of fames and 72 competitions(all laugh) said that helped to kill the zeal(all laugh) but now again is at it(all laugh) then had some nice chat with them Mist spoke as well whole 300 had to be revisited(all laugh) 90 minutes of talking(all laugh) i then called Cili said your disciple and little sis has been spoiled at 301st(all laugh) Cili said no man that Zekrom creates triangles to pave the way for stak differences in thoughtful lectures to break groups(all burst into laughter) i said yeah pretty much(all laugh) so that was from 8:15-10:30 total including dinner(all laugh) and why it’s morning now(all laugh) is cause i go to washroom and just come out announcement comes video call at Cerulian City Gym(all laugh) i said so the whole world will only today has to say everything to me(all laugh) Mist was laughing saying too old to be LONELY(all laugh) anyway i go there and i was stunned really cause call came in video i could see the caller is Mrs Melody Sanders Harrison(all laugh and .) i said,’yeah,hellow Melody nice to see you,how are you’,’Mr Ash Ketchum,professionally Johto Winner,personally loser(all laugh)’ then she sweetly smiles so i realized it’s a trick(all burst into laughter) so i say,’i see,are you happy because the old Alakazam personally didn’t return to pokeball himself that day taking 13 more professional years(all laugh) or are you happy because little Alakazams professionally want to personally battle you(all laugh)..’,’by not professionally eavesdropping(all laugh)’,i said,’well being a member of the personal club of showing 10 psychic lucky charm in a professional but world wide telecasted semifinal have you heard of kids find pictures of mommy rather for a change sitting too close to daddy hallucinations(all laugh)’,’or uncle is hugged by mommy sending aunty in deliriums(all laugh)’,i said,’well Melody is pleasing tune but does the tune gets little to big or big to little in unlike hallucinations(all laugh)’,’a Mrs May Maple Blackmore says except only one ever starve to devour(all laugh)’,’i see the spearding of the tune in both halves of the building(all laugh) who else are in auditorium(all laugh)’,’a Dr Muk Skechit blacked tickets recently AGAIN(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) seemed more dissapointed than i ever was(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing) is it the effect of the Dragonite(all laugh)’,’i see 37 years was Melodiously extracted then what is it that my Hoenn travel is being retuned now(all laugh)’,’well i don’t understand why the Melody is still playing around so sweetly despite the originator being away from it for 3 years now(all laugh)’,’just the reverberations of the original and real tune that was is and will be Melodius to atleast Alakazam if none else out of hallucination which the originator is too confused with thus wants to travel again with obvious people who unless professional would’ve been mad enough to complete 760 gyms in half the days at Unova(all laugh)’,’well reverberating enough that dark Muk was gently trying to break customers away from Hutchinson Samson Starter Lab,Crystalstum,near Safforn(all laugh)’,’an effort he has succeeded in cause a bunch of mad psychics who were made to dance to the melodius tunes of Levender(all laugh)’,’as will the the Oak labs and Hoenn travel with two little sisters(all laugh,.)’,’but i thought sister was too big to be defeated at Hoenn but has heard the melodius tunes of Pewter surrounding of all places that the Frontier head wishes to retire and thus the gym gets specially psychiced(all laugh) but Mr John Harrison too melodious to play own tunes reciprocating(all laugh) double Kanto champ himself then finding the dark auditorium is too nice to hear nicest melodies has consented that for scoffing people off from anywhere in the world by means of free travel to Karapaskar Wetlands,Unova with a chosen Giratina himself is too good a leeway for the sis to pester bro now in double tunes(all laugh)’,’as the bro is himself doing nothing except playing it big outside while he enjoys some Mistyfying hallucinations too really sweetly Gyaradosical(all laugh)’,’well the bro should be little to pester then(all laugh)’,’bro who has pestered Xormnuh and Hytot-so-what-to-do(all laugh) should be pestered for beyond whole life across generations(all laugh)’,’i see what 8 minutes of 9+3 years wasn’t enough now will everyday pester me with the addition of how to plan and distribute(all laugh) the careers(all laugh) what are the Melodiusly Jhonny names of the dolls again(all laugh)’,’ Eric the eternal rulear of the guess(all laugh and .)’,’nice to meet and fondle the sweet eternal ruler of the sweet Johnny Jr(all laugh)’,’Misty monger(all laugh and .)’,’well will the sensei get respect from the sweet now cunning later (all laugh) Ash Harrison,dial 87 two times to contact Ghostradarkarrigussonor ruled eternally but sweetly always unlike(all laugh) by Mr Eric Harrison,87 HoF(all laugh and .)’,’not possible in both cases as the sensei’s own bunch doesn’t(all burst into laughter)’,’so Mr Mukcheat(all laugh) has whistleblown there to destroy the Medoly then(all laugh)’,’Melodiously played the sweet gentleman(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing)’,’i see his flower will be poisonous(all laugh)’,’former Ms Daisy Waterflower too sweet a Dewgong(all laugh)’,’i see whole family info caught behind hallucinations(all laugh) tell me melodiusly the whoose orchestra played(all laugh)’,’Professor Dr Samuel Oak(all burst into laughter) and for your Ashey information(all laugh) last month Maurice lab tested a certain choised brat named Greninja(all laugh) who is claimed to be most calm among the mad bunch that has caught Lugias(all laugh) Greninja while they told to reciprocate said in Kalos the beau is chosen only if he tickles first(all burst into laughter) which the chosen human brats isn’t doing neither their beaus(all burst into laughter) thus they’re serious(all laugh) then chosen dignified researchers asked Mr Muk that is she a disguised human(all laugh) to which Mr Skechit was asked by her that according to Kalos tradition is she brought here to mole on these human brats so that Mr Skechit picks the best beau(all uncontrollably laugh) then no further progress was possible but Greninja was saying in Kalos it is said as does some chosen brats at the lab that the longer is the wait the stornger is the bodyslam(all burst into laughter) the lab somehow managed to get the brat off(all laugh) and on the same day Bromhorn Dragon Valley was summoned for a choised Charizard who asked the researchers are you looking for a date with my second master(all burst into laughter) but see she has a beau already whom she bodyslams in front of us(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) like our master brat does with the 2nd chosen brat who deals in water pokemons(all laugh) and waits in her home to prolong the longing to jump upon master brat,you see most engaging(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) good dating tricks though(all laugh) are you trying to date after the last date to make her happier than the first date i see dating to negate a date,cunning(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter) the second master world famous dragon trainer name Liza Sendon Dustip was in tears laughing said still want to test this brat the researchers said we have a family(all laugh) so atleast those who handled psychics for some considerable amount of time at the top realized that their master brat is at a level where he and his chosen beaus are better not mingled with else they can themselves send them to find beaus in unknown planes that they are too familier with which others will not be even by testing them(all laugh) and if his non psychic Charizard who stays away can do this what to speak of his most type strengthed dragons the great ghosts called Giratina and Ultranercozma(all laugh) whom he called in press my sweet little Giti and Cozy(all burst into laughter) and this Ultranercozma isn’t a cozy one at all as she was strainght from Team Rocket’s den so too cunning to be mingled with(all laugh) so these melodies heard got a composer interested to visit old dens at Safforn and get a certain beau named Sabrina(all laugh) who was ruled by a Haunter first and then her son a Haunter who became a Gengar next day(all laugh) cause he wasn’t happy at his limitations(all laugh) and then still wasn’t happy even in that gym cause he wanted to unleash(all laugh) then his mom’s master asked for him and the rest with a Sableye who was at the master’s end found the soulmate and the pair is better not spoken of(all laugh) so thus the rest(all laugh) and Mr Foster Slate the professional little bro of a man who was peeking behind the Mist to have a gauge of the outburst(all burst into laughter) later spoke there itself seemed so naive(all laugh and .,Brock shakes his head laughing)’,’i see breaching the trust(all laugh) the word as how did the Medoly respond with soulmated Johhny boy(all laugh) in tunes of a water performance show 3 months ago(all laugh)’,’if the person of a picture was real and universally if she was melodius as per the tunes of a Jhonny lad who was lost in music for 30 minutes(all burst into laughter) and the one before alongside 2 were mechanical rather than of soul the current two with the one are reals so a bad dream is forgotten as that’s what happens to what is not real(all smile)’,’well yeah bad dreams are illusion indeed no doubt as the eternal ruler of hapiness states and the real Melody of the tuned soul is only too good for the world to lose plus i personally never understood that if the little sis has vomitted(all burst into laughter,.)..yeah,the only way i know(all laugh)...being a bit ill then as her hubby lad does sweetening her with the word soulmate as if she didn’t get tired of hearing it since the day of the discovery for both that it has to be brought up all time to get his ways(all laugh) and thus the hubby boy clears the vomit up too gleefully to hold a sway thus the soulmate word(all laugh) can her big bro not do the same with the word being solely improfessional(all laugh) and do the same though he was late in doing so too much cause he was lost in egos really(all laugh) that the sweet little sis has got rid of(all laugh) and so welcome back again from washroom(all laugh) little sis but how has the sis travelled around the big bro to suddenly appear even in his sweet sweet moments(all laugh)’, i could see the vomit shock her first(all laugh) then so happy was trying to hug me from there itself(all laugh) and i knew that sweet little sis must have been brought home before unless the ego so still she is with a fish(all laugh) vomit will get that body out of all ways between any relations thus the trick(all laugh) and the irony is if a brat says that and then praises and all he has lost the game(all laugh and .) he will be forced to admit defeat exactly at the real time scenario the hurdle shrew passed being that type of a Drew(all burst into laughter) yeah with May that had to happen atleast once(all laugh) and with her being reddened there at Johto for 2.5 years happened twice(all laugh) first time i was contacted(all burst into laughter),just called cause it was after May scoffed at him and went on with the food(all laugh) so was bad position and they were ever only two none else were there and you understand with a reddened up kid like May whoose so sweet in core that she doesn’t understand anything except what her trusted ones tell her Drew had to be extremely cunning(all laugh) and i’m just so happy that my sis ever has a man like that with her that is beside her everywhere all the time exactly as i said during that call to Brock(all laugh) so shrew had a hard time then and i always told him after asking how’s my sis ended with fine then Drew you’re taking good care of her and all bye then but caring tick-tock clock clock(all burst into laughter) so the brat was incensed with me(all laugh) now says no man you made sure i not for once could think of my own well being my own career and my own wife if she looked beautiful(all laugh) then even now says LIVING FOR AND THROUGH(all laugh) to get the physical and mental barriers off and if doesn’t happen she isn’t for you quadruple edged(all laugh),countering(all burst into laughter) so then calls me and were at extreme east at Johto so pretty time difference as well calls and says,’INFATUATION(all laugh) hum INFATUATION(all laugh) CHECK YOUR DAMN PHONE(all laugh) and cuts off(all laugh) then i realized what has happened(all laugh) called Brock in and saw 3 pictures the brat pictures with one hand and his dress a bit deluged(all laugh) and another was how much she vomitted(all burst into laughter) then the other was her dress and other things that were spoiled cause it was extremely serious case cause May wasn’t well even before that for a few days and then did what she does with foods so all that dress now the picture shows that the brat was washing(all uncontrollbaly laugh) then i called him back later saying,’i see Drew no it’s ok i was too harsh on you please forgive me but she you saw is needed to be taken care of cause I CHERISH MY GIRLFRIEND SO MUCH(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah INTENTIONALLY LULLING TO EAT CERTAIN FOODS(all burst into laughter) and now KEEPING A TAB ON VOMIT SCHEDULE(all uncontrollbaly laugh) why cause i don’t have any INFATUATION(all laugh) when you call that pest tell her atleast sometimes to listen to her husband..um..(all laugh)..’,’I’VE SECRETLY MARRIED MY GIRLFRIEND(all laugh)’,’yeah PERMISSION,CONSENT,AGREEMNET(all burst into laughter) FAR BETTER THAN GIVING ONLY A TROPHY(all burst into laughter) tell her to EACH DAY do all inside it(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) when you return with a new one CLEAR THE 2 YEAR DRIED UP POLLUTION(all uncontrollably laugh,fits of laughter,tears) hum,RETURNING HUSBAND(all uncontrollbaly laugh) why cause I ONLY THINK ABOUT YOU(all laugh) you’ll be asked for permission when she wants formality ON WHAT I SHOULD DO(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) AND WHAT WOULD PREVENT HER VOMITTING EACH TIME(all burst into laughter) good bye(all laugh)..’ so the pest was taken care of after Johto it was normal cause they were 22+(all laugh) and was married for long by then(all laugh) and Drew in all his travels fell ill only once that too had to be in Johto(all laugh) i consoled him much then and then sister-pester was summoned(all laugh),’um..see you two are alone only don’t get too panicked keep right medicines and all but are you an emotional wife only(all laugh)’,’um..no it’s ok i’m not being emotional i can’t be i’ve to look after my husband..um..(all laugh)...’,’carry on whole world knows it(all laugh)..’,’no i’ll marry only him but the proposal(all burst into laughter)...’ i realized the little pest is too simple to even understand the dangers of looking after Drew alone(all laugh) so then she was reminded of things again but naively(all laugh) crook only had once a trouble a fever by the last months of Sinnoh then i tried to supass him in naivety(all laugh)..Brock please that experience cause the morning is deepneing(all laugh) but i know all of us too happy...”
Brock(laugh) : “well i had a bit of a cold that became a bit serious once in 12 years(all laugh) for people to get worried and this brat was babysitting me(all laugh) using my own tricks(all laugh) i was laughing saying yeah now your test of naivety(all laugh) played the emotional card(all laugh) saying what is it Brock that you will try to excuse yourself even in this condition just relax i’m cunning enough now(all laugh) then showed how cunning the brat really was contacted our Viol flower(all laugh) asked for a self made confusion about Mantine(all laugh) then as Viol was asking for his health being at deep lunch(all laugh) says no new experience Brock is pretty ill(all laugh) then my Viol flower chides me(all laugh) you old fox(all laugh) why are you scaring kids(all laugh) this this is for this this(all laugh) then i asked how are you,i see busy(all laugh) this is why i don’t like you(all laugh) but still thank God it wasn’t the whole family(all laugh)...this brat always plays us(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “cunningly(all burst into laughter) no man you people went far ahead to ashame me whenever my flower decided to picture me up(all laugh) to begin with it had to be a properly posed picture not self created(all laugh) and Lillie wig was the director(all laugh) or Daisy had to do it each time thus whenever the jackal was around she became Daivy(all laugh) then the ink each time(all laugh) then this crook advised how to preserve(all laugh) and each picture came to me via pawns(all laughs) that was enough to be cunning(all laugh) anyway,so the vomit gets the Melody to sis up(all laugh) and yeah as i said about the ego it was the ego of honesty that i was only about my bunch and all so much that i don’t care that i’m a human too and thus has been sucking up many people for my nourishment and then using that ego to neglect them that was cut at Unova by utmost battle starved lunatic vulgar brats(all laugh) so all thanks to their epitomised feauture there which also got Mr Oak Mr Oak to change profession for the best of the world(all laugh,Gary shakes his laughing) cheers for my sweetly dreaded soulmate from 107 such the one and only TYRAniTAR(all laugh and cheers for Choised Brats,all burst into laughter)...so she beams and giggles and goes,’i see vomitting around(all laugh) when we appear there anytime(all laugh) you’ll be babysitting your nephews cause you’re an absolute pro there(all laugh)’, and you know she was giggling and all but all i recalled was May and i was so happy and then said,’yeah suddenly most welcome(all laugh) but shouldn’t the sweet little sis be drowsy(all laugh)’,’except 58 minutes per month not(all laugh) and does the left over time permits for an orchestra of sympohony(all laugh)’,’i see pestering big bro after Jhonny boy has been forced to babysit so that the devillish sis has found time to pester poor bro(all laugh)..’,’where’s the sis-in-law(all laugh)’...to be honest you know i knew about Muk’s meeting with Melody(all laugh) THRICE(all laugh) but never expected this stuff and all neither did Muk,Professor has played a game(all laugh) cunning(all laugh) but i was happy too much cause as usual i’ve ever felt very bad for her especially after Kalos myself cause i saw damn brats jumping up and down there and Melody was in contact with me and i thought only in her case out of all people in the world i was harsh cause she asked me so many times that this and that is disturbing concentration how do you maintain such a disposition and all personally tell me and i ever used to say it’s just the bond with the bunch as you yourself has just concentrate there professionally(all laugh) the rest will be fine so lets see Metagross(all laugh) and she ever laughed and continued but i now after getting the full Kalos Wisdom realize that she felt a bond with me ever and was trying to breach that and i ever had an affectionate feeling for her which i never cared about cause of my age and her and all later realized just she is a nice person and even after that meeting at Safforn still the same and only as i was looking at her today i could see May again was too happy exactly what she was on that day after semifinals i was a loser and she was all over me as if i was the winner and so on i instantly realized how great a trainer she is as did she that may be just that Madgaleo is something special just frivolus that day(all laugh) so yeah i felt so happy to see her in that way cause her behaviour despite my professionality unlike the whole world made her more happy than anyone and wanted to breach that never could neither did i help and her nature is so much frank that was cheated upon just like my own wife’s sweetness was mistaken as something else so anyway then i asked Mist to come and went for refreshments cause the night would be long(all laugh) so now Misty flower your 16 year long wait to prey upon your sworn in enemy how did that go(all laugh)..”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “too naive(all laugh)..my sweet bee is like that all wants him(all laugh)..my Ash did tell her story on the very next day after marriage at presence of mom as well i knew her plight from that but this really is unbelievable..so we spoke a bit then in brief told me my bee was too sweet for her AS I REALIZED(all laugh) but she is exactly like May but way more frank and extremely dangerously so cause i was foisted upon her whole personal life(all laugh) then said how my Ash was the only one ever professional to her no matter what except Sabrina of course(all laugh) and his ideas and all and then that meeting as well but that infamous beau and brother differentiation that the whole world knows as something unique had made her realize that how much devoted he is to his then declared fiancee(all laugh) which she realized as none except Misty flower(all laugh) cause she saw his professionality full blast(all laugh) even on that day of meeting and that won’t break at all and no other expectation will be there from her either but now these brats that are redifining reflective vulgarity of prolonging distributed happiness(all laugh) has made sure none comes anywhere near them cause they can send them to cosmic darkness to play(all laugh) as they directly try to connect with them to foist there ideas upon them without hallucinations but other psychic currents that are too Xormnuhed(all laugh) and the psychic holders then is realizable what they can do(all laugh) a pokemon now himself trying to gauge the master first(all laugh) so as if they are waiting to prey upon you if you want to harm them they will fondle you to the darkness of vulgarity(all laugh) they have completely scanned each legend and shared their own opinions among themselves and Magmortgolem knows every bit of it thus accelerated so much(all laugh) and those two new imports being eternal moles can be most devastating in this aspect(all laugh) exactly what the lab needs(all laugh) and more dangerouly all these years of breaking the challenger and his masters bond now my bee told them that be suspicious of HUMAN activities(all laugh) they know how to connect to HUMANS(all laugh) and how legends does it in swelled up condition and what they do in that condition thus they know everything about everything(all laugh) and then finally they know my bee so well that other human beings are now being generalized that too with too jovial threats to their deaths(all laugh) a pokemons natural psychic connect has been vulgarized beyond death now(all laugh) and Lugias are being used to enhance the knowledge(all laugh) they even can manipulate innocent little kids as well(all laugh) and with the pests that are around our little dolls will to the whole world’s misfortune tell them the gradual growth of human beings and all can get the implication(all laugh) and this was learnt by following Gary and Lillie and then Trace and Daisy to the extent that they know the little ones are like you as well and you know what it means is that God forbid they can’t but if they aren’t good human beings atleast pokemons they will not turn against(all smile) and what they are that are true gems by all means will become too supreme in this profession for sure but beware of that age(all laugh) but using exactly that any of us can show them what reality is(all laugh) countering(all laugh) thus Conhoopa and Darkramar of all ghosts are looking after babies below 2(all laugh) and when mom isn’t around inform them all time(all laugh) total psychic channel of whole world has been discovered by them means as that report suggest it’s 108 now(all laugh) and may be the Lugia too in future(all laugh) so 108 are once only legends in their own rights who better not be mingled with but enjoyed as Oak lab only is trusted by them and this also is cause they were told about that termination so they caught that and are ferociously playfull now in extreme vulgarity(all laugh) and they are self dependent humans in inferior form now with the ability to even understand the different bond with pokemons and their masters if they are male or not male(all laugh) upto that extent they know with legendary tricks(all laugh) so they can foist themselves upon anyone and even fool them using similar currents into thinking they are naive(all laugh) this means they can be finally deceitful to even humans(all laugh) so even if the termination order is passed that full blast vulgarity must be appeased(all laugh) while they fondle them with psychic channels(all laugh) my bee is so well known they can pick i guess now what your motive is at that moment so even to abuse them great actors are needed(all laugh) and that day they looked after me bore the full blast of my bee’s human emotions and mine separately and still through his mine and the viseversa in a different form for 6 hours(all laugh) and constantly gave their own opinions on it to show it’s nothing to them(all laugh) and that was that level of emotion so we understand what level they are at with psychics and what my bee means to them and viseversa(all laugh) and you know Giratina has been doing the momentary analysis of changing signals for ages(all laugh) this is a 108 strong invincible military totally self dependent and that too jovially for the world to say enough with pokemons i’m quitting profession(all laugh) so they don’t bother to reciprocate to the human demands in general unless their master or you the trusted ones tell them by meaning it(all laugh) and Dr Muk Skechit never can mean it(all laugh) and also our family bond has been picked up by them and Chu did the rest(all laugh) so my bee can’t turn them against us even if he wishes unless he can deceive them(all laugh) this means he has to feel physically threatened to an extent where he will mean them to attack us seriously but that can’t happen unless he picks up that threat himeslf that we may murder him as well(all laugh) they just see the world through their master to an extent where they have become him and the viseversa is the reason for that(all laugh) they are truely our extended family in that form and expects that from us so Gengleyedauntogator(all laugh) so Melody with these understood that my bee was at a level that was to be broed upon(all laugh) and with her own intuitions which is why none can forget her deeds in leagues once ever talent in psychic pokemons realized that my Ash should be venered and gave the name to her second son and finally after many thoughts and shows(all laugh) decided to jump upon him(all laugh) and poked me(all laugh) i was too happy as well cause i only knew more than too well how great my sworn in enemy is(all laugh) and talked about that(all laugh) and this took one full hour(all laugh) with notes that John wanted to become the gym leader there and Foster to Brock who was naive(all laugh) and then Professor Oak and then Sabrina(all laugh) then Lance of all people(all laugh) and so on finally Mrs May Maple Blackmore was contacted as her own career and the master’s have so much connection and Professor was asked about possibilities of becoming little sis(all laugh) he send them to May yeah that was the word(all laugh) who knew about her cause my bee always told the whole world in absolute details of his Johto loss(all laugh) Melody using that word to Professor itself gave him the idea that this girl is as simple as her kids(all laugh) and so on complex chains for 4 months(all laugh) finally after May says cause she finds similar natured sis much more dangerously cunning(all laugh) knew the whole story from here and there(all laugh) then finally jumped us and all reciprocated cause all wanted Melody to be back at profession cause she is such a name and all else so then i say welcome to family(all smile) and all happy cause she herself single child mom she never saw dad passed away 5 years back was with uncles and all none liked her nature and all then John was there all along he tooonly child both parets passed away by when he was 24 and he is 2 years younger to Melody but none bothered later realized only and too happy now only but we will have to talk with the whole world now as to many things(all laugh) then my bee was again summoned and she said prolong the wait(all laugh) so i’m also happy cause enemies submit(all laugh)...my(all laugh) sweet bee(all laugh)...(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “right so that brat has made her way here and infact already booked a room at the Cerulian Gym whenever she pleases(all laugh) cause will be moving to get the symbol and Johnny boy will walk to it by his own merits being a double Kanto champ himself but again Indigo Platue may reconsider it once more in 9 days(all laugh) and Saul had a Weavile(all laugh) too happy all of us as you see and yeah i then after that took another hour to discuss about what she wants in profession and all(all laugh)..so Mr Muk Skechit how’s the extension..”
Tracey(laugh) : “please behold Dr Muking Jackal’s legend taming method is action AH!HUMAN!HUMAN!(all laugh and .,all cheer for Human,all burst into laughter)...”
Daisy(laugh) : “that brat found the melodius powers at my poor Dewgy’s expense at 4th ever gym(all laugh) had contacts for long till went to Kalos later Misty flower was here so didn’t(all laugh)...too happy to get her back professionally and ten personally just too sweet a kid i ever remember as a brat(all laugh)...”
Brock(laugh) : “still was about Boulder(all laugh)...this brat has got a real cunning sis now(all laugh)..why is it so Viol that always MY FAMILY(all laugh) is dragged..”
Violet(laugh) : “..AH!ROCK-IN-WATER!(all burst into laughter,.)..”
Brock(laugh) : “as per the extended family drama i’ll dose them sometimes to hold sawy(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “well Tyranitar has been playing me for 16 years(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “and with all these the pet is laughing as too easily will get in-between sawys(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “well today is too late for that though(all laugh)..but just before going i must ask that with all pending possibilities and legendary meance like McShin and Jasu(all laugh) you will need all attention of frivolity(all laugh) so all of you actually cause the bottom line(all laugh) here is the gyms and the donations(all laugh) so i having pestered you for such a long time and i’m saying it here cause you know the result(all laugh) so first most honoured Violet sis strating from you are you happy with your familial salary(all burst into laughter)...”
Violet(laugh) : “naively(all laugh)..well we’ll get another gym(all laugh) and 3 Cities Cup is all ours as well(all laugh) and Dave has also now forcefully registered as being in Hall of Fame at Kanto(all laugh) feeding the opposition to undercover saying he can claim two Hall of Fames and the two had to be Jasu and McShin(all laugh) cunning cause that only now appeases both bros(all laugh) so will be battling there as well we have free pass to all(all laugh) and by virtue of that his bunch can visit here as well as atleast 20 ever stay(all laugh) so yeah my position as publicity manager(all laugh) is unique and very good in fortune(all laugh) all the sponsors and all has to pass through Mantine(all laugh) and the weekend water shows as well at Mist flower’s den(all laugh) so yeah i can stop all other’s salaries in sway struggle(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “but the pet is conspiring in-between(all laugh) i’m too happy not cause never will i be a realtion to you Salary Ketchum(all laugh) but happy too much because my lion is totally in my hand now(all laugh)...”
Gary(laugh) : “and this brat has made sure my other lackies sabotage me by being humanly naive(all laugh) really i must quit(all laugh)...and with the absolute maximum of 2700 arcs(all laugh) even the distribution is right(all laugh) all continuous as well(all laugh) but hardly a trouble with the facilities and travelling engines Kalos too much ego too much money(all laugh) and then whole forest and so many things Pewter and Viridian has huge shares and all but we don’t have to think about the damn general law is the biggest thing as Zara is resident here with the practise at Viridian of all places(all laugh) and our absolute total area including forest and all is still equal distribution at 6150 arcs(all laugh) then Persy Kalos is really ugly in ethical honesty of ethics(all laugh) and the discontinuous mass only holds our quarters(all laugh) the other residents are too happy that Pallet has become a villege again(all laugh) town only has kept the name cause it has been kept as it was as the sludge influx totally stopped due to fear of felling into the three lenegary shining dark stream through rocks and right questions to keep right as right all in pursuit of hapiness(all laugh) no those 5 brats have threatened the whole world and the most dreaded philospohy5 with reflections and momentary whereabouts of a thing being so in evolutionary phases of redefining the known type as human in question of in poisons by the meanings of them of insatiation of different virtues hindering purity of the picture perfection of telling others who they are has got rid of everyone away to save themselves(all laugh) really Unova can’t be forgotten(all laugh) what eternally chosen brats has entered this world in the veil of dragons and ghosts(all laugh) and with Kalos downpour i guess we can have that lure machine bid won finally(all laugh) and if we don’t either of our 3 comrades at Hoenn,Sinnoh and Johto of all places(all laugh) are getting so barely a trouble and they are so happy to get their weeds cut as well(all laugh) we now have same area as starter labs as well(all laugh) plus Lomstom has incredible 500 arcs still even across residence area which helps Dave only(all laugh) Persy Kalos has played real 87 with finances hodling sway over all and Kalos(all laugh) and the process was getting delayed only due to Ash not being present and was hard but Zara was here all time but she still says keeping pests at bay for 8 months under that situation and she was almost alone Dave was at Sinnoh but she said not at all you Dave and me both didn’t want to move an inch after what we heard in thoughts of being moral in ethical honesty of beautiful knowledge as circularly elusive(all laugh) infact your bunch got us through in court cases as well(all laugh) in last days Zara used to tell Lenny give me more such lines and i’ll see how the brats win this one(all laugh) the ideas of happiness reflecting in honesty of ethical morality at somewhere in toughts(all laugh) finally even human general law has had to budge to our brats(all laugh) and the general government support was there but of course it’s Kanto(all laugh) but the few we know Mr Neil Jackson and his gang of 4(all laugh) they are too ugly in the ultimate bottom line of the bottom line(all laugh) and the staffs we got are so good that they jumped to have families right here and soumates agreed as well too happily as none wants to miss those lines man really(all laugh) and the chosen staffs we have with our 3 comrades helping us and all and that joint research is also for all of us such a great thing to do and the legal trouble will be less cause all knows the 107 brats aren’t budging to anyone except us(all laugh) Magmortgolem has become extremely dangerous cause if they go to other places they will comeback with recruits with them(all lugh) and Professor Kukui,Birch and Naomi has never had any ill feeling or jelousy towards us or grandpa neither their successors they acknowledge our work and comes here to test your bunch with us and always shares their knowledge no hard feelings at all cause they understand the basic that it’s the bunch who will choose not us and neither do we want any monopoly now that we’ve got them we want the right approach only but properly which is to be told to this Muk(all laugh) and your lackie Saul at Frucient(all laugh) is too good a 2 time champ that too of Orange-Kanto double(all laugh) and he had to be present in that fatefull theatre hall visit at Lumburg(all laugh) and that too with beautiful men(all laugh) who if Saul wasn’t already a admirer have brainwashed him with Gengarian philosphy of all(all laugh) to a degree that he is just so naive(all laugh) as will be Pewter with Jhon now and Melody of all greats joining if with Dave of all hall of fames 3 Cities will finally get the certificate to become Indigo league itself becoming weeklong competition in separate sections which will get budding Ash and Dave to absolutely love the possibility of having weeklong battle fest at the one and only psudo-legend and normal mix cup(all laugh) and what types they are(all laugh) and the only type was Electric and the rest two competitions were just namecalls(all laugh) but now those two has been made the grassroots and the original 3 cities is totally dark now(all laugh) any type psudeo legend or normal except pure water and hence Lomstom residents themselves have volunteered to pour money as suscription cause it’ll be two on two twice then same in final with last round as one on one tradition(all laugh) hence only champs or very serious battlers will come and hence absolute memorable each match(all laugh) so it’ll also serve new breeding ground for future greats like Dave himself and Lance and Persy and so on and even gym leaders but water isn’t included cause it’s going to be the open ocean challenge if our Mrs Misty Ketchum agrees(all laugh) which we know isn’t it minus y’s husband(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well Mrs Misty Waterflower Ketchum,hall of fame water pokemon gym,Cerulian City,Kanto is now at the state of Misty..Misty..so cute cute girl isn’t it Misty(all laugh)..namecall is a namecalled gym leader and whole day Misty,Misty,Misty(all burst into laughter)..Ash why don’t you like me(all burst into laughter)..so(all burst into laughter),this Mistdos version is not in a condition to talk(all laugh) and that name is too sweet cause that was the actual ring(all laugh) so,the answer is it’s a matter of fake signature(all laugh) and yeah it’s just a matter of time(all laugh) but Saul has to participate big time here which he is forcing me to allow him(all laugh) and even Mrs Slate is so happy(all laugh) and well Mist of course doesn’t want to know anything so burden falls here(all laugh) and it’ll be one on one challenge cause it’s tough out in deep ocean(all laugh) but it’ll be 2 at a time final three(all laugh) but then finally Brawn can wholeheartedly laugh cause it’s Zekrom and Raichu vs the same(all laugh)...but Mr Oak your lecture doesn’t include the bottom line(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “cause i must be rich(all laugh)..about salaries Ashey-boy we should be prized(all laugh)...no really none does more being in hall of fame than Ash is doing by looking after his bunch who has become extremely intelligent now as Misty was saying i guess with that termination and second battleion playing and now Lugias(all laugh) they are similar to humans minus the emotions to such a degree that you can even consult with Feraligator for a plan(all laugh) if only you can be vulgar to extreme(all laugh) and all the infoes that his bunch gives to us to manipulate(all laugh) and now his discussions with Dave for just one day is being extended up in distibutions to increase that longing(all laugh) and now another weekday is to discuss whole day about psychics of all tyes(all laugh) with of all people it will be Melody(all laugh) and then it will be just Cili(all laugh) from Unova of all places(all laugh) thrice a weak for full 1 hour that too one day being with a region renouned dragon breeder(all laugh) and the rest one day it as it is Dr Gary Oak and Dr Tracey Skechit in turns will be pestered in public(all laugh) then the other day is most exciting cause it’s to become just that art of naivety(all laugh) and this Ash will say with Cili(all laugh) now and no we’re not sleepy(all laugh) cause the sound system is such(all laugh) and then the recorded weekends plans(all laugh) Saul will definitely be there even if vacation and just that we have the great master of professionality himself in Foster(all laugh) and now John’s discussions will be added so Ash salaries are huge(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “yeah i will but lets talk bout Gengarosophy Brock(all laugh) and your salaries and i’ll go last and also the Muking specialist will speak after Daisy cause else it’s just inhuman(all laugh)...”
Brock(laugh) : “beautiful men are after the whole world now(all laugh) ask me that what is to be learnt from rock types(all laugh) but the drama(all laugh) and they too are happy cause Wendy was insinuated that unless they and Saul and his now wife Junia who were the oppositions against getting Misty involved like that silently though all did but the head knew the reason that unless champs are given respect he will empoly them hismself(all laugh) which he showed with Saul and Junia is a pokemon ranger for your infos again(all laugh) too happy to work with Braum and Tony of all people(all laugh) this meant that Ivana will be forced to give places for beautiful men playing sentimental bias card(all laugh) and the opposite side of the bias is just McShin(all burst into laughter,.) and he will resist this death first hand to force Ivana to force Wendy to do the job(all laugh) and she did and men are back to the previous positions really McShin,Ivana,Jasu and Wendy are sworn in enemies now exactly what Ash wants(all laugh) the rest Mark is born opponent of Persy exactly why he was selected there(all laugh) and Cynthia as usual too scared to wake up(all laugh) and McShin is now 47,Ivana 49,Jasu 45(all laugh) and Wendy too 45(all laugh) whereas Persy is 46 and Mark is 44(all laugh) so similar age group for Persy and Ash is playing pester-bro-middle now with Dave being little bro pest(all laugh) and they have spoiled Persy beyond repair(all laugh) so men are too happy so happy that i had to warn them when time comes not to name their future Gengar(all burst into laughter) but this brat must pey me personally for professional services to 107 absolute brats with 2 now being included for 21 long years(all laugh) and then for asking me naive questions(all laugh) and really Foster will get the hall of fame in professionality soon(all laugh) Dad,mom and Flores must battle each day cause he doesn’t get quality(all laugh) so yeah Ash’s method of turning 3 City into monoploy has been perfect(all laugh) and with Cerulian city personally Kane,Harris,Tony and Braum all are in top positions and now Junia is so happy(all laugh) but really Ash whatever has been done already if Melody is back in profession just as much to to share her knowledge again in discussions it’s a different level then with who she is simply and her experiences as well so yeah that you will say and yeah by the way why isn’t our Misty flower getting a date(all laugh)...”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “all are getting dates cause i’m allowing them to look at my sweet bee(all laugh)..and all of you should remember that only i book my bee(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh,same pose) : “well with Mist it’s been 15 years since i spoke about pokemons seriously(all laugh,Ash and Misty smiles at each other) cause i was so interested about her than her bunch(all laugh) each time Gyarados became how she was fondling her(all laugh) and all was about her activities whole day(all laugh) Mist only too gladly reciprocated cause otherwise none can talk about own activities whole day(all laugh) so it was that even if a crook eavesdropped none could realize what our intension were(all laugh) it was like yeah then the challenger said this attack what were your counter,um..just thought deeply for a moment and(all laugh) that ifrown s what i wanted to see(all laugh)...but please Mrs Daisy Skechit Cascade..(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “i’m not happy at all cause all my baby sisters got prizes but i got the flack despite being their sensei(all laugh) plus i’ve been particularly chosen in the presence of the master brat to look after abosultely none but Heracross,Bayleaf,Torquail and Wimsicott(all burst into laughter) the moody brats are there with Bayleaf and Torquail’s whole family tree(all laugh) and still has Heracross(all laugh) and then Bayleaf lulls me to the jackal’s trap myself(all laugh) and Heracross the same if i use that on fox he will play sentimental card(all laugh) and Whimsicott is better not mentioned(all laugh) absolute epitome of his name that brat is like Butterfree,Dusknoir and Guzzlord(all laugh) and the cunning jackal is too happy now a days cause he had such hard time for 17 years(all laugh) now i can be tricked left and right(all laugh) and the sly fox has been fed ideas like those who are sentimenatal can be as much alive(all lburst into laughter) especially cause after my long career at sentimantal outbursts but now with little dolls i’ve become all that more naive(all burst into laughter) and jackal is cunningly fed many sources for talking(all laugh) really the second cousin mask and now for last 4 months this(all laugh) you see at this age the issues that i face(all laugh) i want all your and your flower’s salary(all laugh) and Misty flower enjoying very own salary aren’t you(all laugh)..?”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “take that for calling me back to the gym you namecalled jackaled Dase(all laugh) and my bee hands over the rest of his salary to me and asks for money(all burst into laughter)..sweet(all laugh) bee..(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “well Misty flower has been abjectly ashed since that forsaken day(all laugh)..”
Misty(smile,same pose) : “yeah by cunning jackals and naive crooks(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “but my Ash didn’t like me that day(all laugh)..”
Misty(sigh,all laugh,same pose) : “Trace just spit out your unfair demands don’t look at my hubby(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “we want..”
all in unison(laugh) : “your bee(all burst into laughter)..”
Misty(irritated,same pose,Ash burst into laughter,same pose) : “SHUT UP!(all laugh).. else i’ll spoil the little ones to vomit(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “young flower dream(all laugh)...right(all burst into laugter)..fine(all laugh) toffee-flower(all laugh)...so(all laugh),then Trace your salary(all laugh)..”
Tracey(all laugh) : “among directors only i’m happy(all laugh) cause first my family is less revered(all laugh) and second not being professional means i’m not asked for 2 words(all laugh) and only i tolerate the full lectures without saying one word back(all laugh) but still i’ve two utmost brats Glalie and Beeheeyem(all laugh) but they remind me of the homework(all laugh) no really the way Gary is confined now(all laugh) while always it was Lillie before(all laugh) and now Daisyl of all Daivys(all laugh) is totally trapped(all laugh) but still it had to be AH!STEELIX!STEELIX!(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “the second command was ever at bay with Brock’s activities(all laugh) and was a bit shakey of the Boulder AS USUAL(all laugh) but now it’s all in her favour(all laugh) and my lion has been taught how to not become a pet to own wife(all burst into laughter) a set up that has got my lion to absolute bay(all laugh) cause the first time he said please these responsibilities i can’t brush aside despite people desperately volunteering to do them for me(all laugh) whole day had to wifesist me(all laugh) so 2 words are AH!GARY!GARY!(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “i revolt against all these and the increment of salaries and too many staffs(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “a wig for a day(all laugh)/if 107 advisors added Mr Oak won’t you be Mr Oak eternally at the personal bay(all laugh)..and just wait till John and Melody arrives to pester you even more(all laugh) and my sis says um..won’t McShin help us to compete again at Kanto(all laugh) but,anyway,and about the plans of discussion(all laugh) well first Cili(all laugh)..Cili is like the 4 goons i have at Cerulian(all laugh) but much closer cause he was the only person to see the whole picture at Unova twice(all laugh) and Iris knows but she doesn’t know the subsequent chapters(all laugh) but now will(all laugh) Iris is a great person really just was scraed then(all laugh) and i went uncover and just thought why bother about people and never contacted neither did she want and Cili as well Cili returned 3 years later at Unova of all places(all laugh) Cili is just Rayquaza(all laugh) so the brat will be pestered whole 1 hour by Rayqaza’s questions only(all laugh) means whole life will be passed(all laugh) he had to agree cause i said unless you do Jane will know how you were scared of REAL dragons(all laugh)...Cili(all laugh)...just love that man such a great friend he is and he realizes that but each time loses it with frivolity(all laugh) and he can’t say anything back cause now 3 other ‘mams with their soulmates are here(all laugh) and my ‘mam has told the world that she is a Gyarados with me(all laugh)...right(all burst into laughter),then Cili is the reason why i had such chosen brats(all laugh) cause he knew where to find them i just told him get me to inhibitations i want a Palkia or a Latios or a Giratina or a Reshiram,Kyurem,Hoopa,Confragigus,Zekrom(all laugh) like that and what chosen brats have entered(all laugh) where(all laugh) and of course we have to tell them who they are(all laugh) and Cili was very too happy cause i just told him that look there’s a myth that Unova is something different and that me being 300 up there(all laugh) just get rid of that phobia of dragons(all laugh) and it helps dragons cause Orange doesn’t treat them well(all laugh) neither does inter Kalos regions(all laugh) and beautiful men are preaching my knowledge in Palkia handling(all laugh) so a few somehow managed to save thier lives(all laugh) and then with Cili it can be good though none takes dragons as starters(all laugh) just the little Mists at gyms who gets a Gible at 9(all laugh) mind the words and names(all laugh) Bagon(all laugh),Dratini(all laugh),Axeu,Deino,Tryrunt,Poipole(all laugh),Skrelp(all laugh),Jangomo -o(all laugh),Gible,Goomy, finally Noibat(all laugh) you know you can’t give a Naganadel as a starter or Poipole as a toy to a kid no matter how trained(all laugh) so poison is still undefined(all laugh) legend came said what is poison to a poison(all laugh) legend thought was threathening her charged said this anger what is it is it the feeling or the poison as result of the feeling(all burst into laughter) that was it cause legend of Heunicrastop realized that it means the anger will never cease unless the feeling does and the reason it won’t is cause there is no reason outside so what is poison means answer of poision means answer yourself to yourself of your own feelings(all laugh) so you can understand a human will be flattened so what to speak of this(all laugh) then same result Naganadel was first dragon to return told Bulbasaur serious posion can never get that FEELING(all laugh)..get the clue(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “you brat don’t let that pest anywhere near in civic rooms(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “room is nothing cause that feeling(all laugh)..so,Noibat will only go to Gili mom dad at my age the issues that she faces(all burst into laughter) Goomy has to be with Ash jr to count the time since when Melody has become a loser(all laugh) and Gible is going to Olympia to reflect upon thoughts of last battle if next day is holiday(all laugh),Deino can only go Alice to for Drew to understand the right kind of weather for the right kind of date resulting in right sort of timed vomit(all burst into laughter) with Alissa getting Jangomo-o as a tribute to Torchic(all laugh),Boulder has booked me(all laugh) so Tyrunt will go to Foster and Flores to decide upon the water part(all laugh) and if double they will have a double delight(all laugh),Skrelp going to Blosie and Jas will have Poipole(all laugh) cause they will be at Venturiastrog(all laugh) and finally Max will get Axeu or double that to keep the little pest grounded from his desperate simulation experiments(all laugh) and Swablue will go to Eric to as both my and Jhon’s tribute to Melody’s nature and skills along with all(all smile) but keep the suspence up(all laugh) no really i’m not joking that’s what Cili has been ordered with stern warnings of 302nd(all laugh) and Jane has scoffed Cili off to book me as well(all laugh) so i said it will only be Dratini(all laugh) then Saul too has said and Junia agreed so have i that it has to be a Bagon(all laugh) so that was that BUT(all laugh) keep up the suspence(all laugh)..no really you’ll see those once they are 10(all laugh) imagine entering your first contest at 16 with a Kommo-o (all laugh) and then the serious part is that as you understand Melody retunring even as just being in the board of the competition or the discussions and no she i don’t believe will want to battle again except gym emergencies that is what she said yesterday but she will most gladly pester me in discussions cause she is too incuisitive about hallucinations(all laugh) and then finally and this is the most exciting(all laugh) Casper will not get a dragon but will get a guess Mrs Violet Slate(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “Geodude(all burst into laughter)...AH!MOMMY!MOMMY!(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “great chose but Mrs Slate is familiar with Brock(all laugh) so Brock family WIDE issue(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “i get it that brat Diancie(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “no not type specified(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “Magikarp(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “might be might be(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “i get this brat’s feelings(all laugh) that brat Poipole(all burst into laughter)..”

....................................................................................................................................................
(8 days later night,Melody,May,David present, John and family already spoke as did Drew and Zara,only Ash is present,Misty in their room)

Ash(laugh) : “siblings i see...cunning-sister,sister-pester and Dave bro(all laugh) what are the demands(all laughs)..”
May(laugh) : “what is the order(all laugh) cause these two chosen ones are way more cunning(all laugh)...”
David(laugh) : “not spewed though(all burst into laughter)...professionally being personal shrew(all burst into laughter)...”
May(laugh) : “i see loopholes in the law(all laugh)...”
Melody(laugh) : “well still none of you are bigger than the big one literally and also to have beaten the big brat under the same adverb(all laugh) so i take that personally(all laugh)”
Ash(laugh) : “i see mind games(all laugh)..as a shield to veil that Alakazam was 4 seconds away only(all laugh)..but as you see all one needs to do is to say thank you senor i’m feel at once in the 9th moon(all laugh)..”
Melody(laugh) : “McShin may join us soon as well(all laugh)..so first the little big sister’s demands(all laugh) how about my reshaped career with my little kids..(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “why doesn’t the littlest sis say reddenedly(all laugh)...”
May(laugh) : “Melody would’ve had serious troubles appeasing Madgaleo(all laugh) in both forms(all laugh) only Dave could’ve succeeded with kids get first lollypop halucinations(all laugh) in questions(all burst into laughter) but thank God now we have a competitor in hallucinations as well else we were about to go mad(all laugh)..”
Melody(laugh) : “well about hallucinations i’ve been grilled over that for 11 years(all laugh) another year thankfully he was under the cover(all laugh) and those Q/A training advises were the central reason why i decided to quit the profession(all laugh) but Ashey bro why is it taken for granted that i’ll sabotage John’s career a couple of years later(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “the competition allows differences which is not your ball game(all laugh) but lets see red-sister how good your bias is(all laugh)..”
David(laugh) : “or better(all laugh)..”
May(laugh) : “your improfessional half deals in it so you’re a pro in it by now(all laugh) so from neutral perspective i say lets see Melody Sanders from Safforn,Kanto,starter Espeon 1st region-Kanto-win,second region Johto-win special(all laugh), 4th region Hoenn-bro why do you want to drag Scrafty in(David,Ash and May laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “well for Melodies new project find out the hallucinations in questions as to from what position who this is said to achieve what in which way by which logic(all laugh) that a Scarfty said to the legend you’re happy that you can kill me and sad cause the reason to be happy for you now is exactly that(all burst into laughter) see this duality happens in families too you’re happy and sad cause of the whisperings of your beau(all laugh) thus being dual type myself and shrewd and also Drew(all laugh) am i not your family who is who(all burst into laughter)..metaphysical family schism master(all laugh) utter brat that is..any idea why these pests had to drag me into their fluke existence together this time here(all laugh)..”
Melody(laugh) : “cause they were asked do you understand the difference between the bias of emotions with respect to the diffrence as it appeares as to the observers due to this different exsistential understanding in terms of illusion being projected by this very difference on top of this oneness in hallucinations that the different varieties of this gender in bias creates differneces in meeting with boss without the expectations forgetting today is the anniversary hallucinations(all burst into laughter)...”
May(laugh) : “i see already realized Scrafty(all laugh)..”
Melody(laugh) : “well i realized this Scrafty on that semifinal day itself when he complemented me saying your Alakazam has understood the difference between as-is and as-as by means of your views in a different way as your partcular gender can serve the prologed sorrow hallucination to the opponent better(all burst into laughter) and then for next 11/12 years i’ve heard these questions actually this absurdity is what spoiled my career(all laugh) cause i asked bunch like do you understand the meaning of the attack called attack(all laugh) they attacked me by not hallucinating physical violence(all laugh) cause it was Houndoom(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “thus Scrafty can reviwe the process thus she is dragged here cause it’s so Melodius(all laugh)..”
Melody(laugh) : “i would’ve forced Misty to long for another month for proposal which story i’ll hear today(all laugh)...no none could win against that Snorlax unless the spot herself but herself infact(all laugh)..”
May(laugh) : “yeah i guess so as well surely these two would’ve fixed the match before(all laugh) but do hear that story it’s just so funny at poor Misty’s cost(all laugh) and so 4th Hoenn-runners up or draw(all laugh)..no it might be though hard but possible(all laugh),5th McShin cup(all laugh)- 9-1 start exactly next month to show McShin that he was petulant(all laugh),6th Jasu(all laugh) -win..no really if Jasu is there we may give a thought on the thought at that age to move there(all laugh) and you would’ve played the same card there saying why would we break our friendship by being direct competitors(all laugh) simple logic that we played despite being couples we’re not bothered about draws and then we knowing everything are not starting at different months either(all laugh) so what’s the trouble then for others with they said fixing(all laugh) and you know in Orange finally wisdom dawns upon them that yeah two times lucky that didn’t face at pervious rounds so must now(all laugh) faced thrice same result each times said only on first round so they could be whimsical out of 5 two judges said that’s unfair and if only 1 it would’ve been ruled as that but 2 meant you can’t so that was as well fixed(all laugh) and both of us said this is fixing for sure(all laugh) so the ball went to their court(all laugh) had to bring an extra brat in whom Drew defeated abjectly in 1 minute 3 seconds exactly(all laugh) then had to separate us next round(all laugh) asked us surely fixed we said yeah just couples(all laugh) then 7th Kalos of all places(all laugh) – win,8th Johnny guy(all laugh) – perfectly Melodyed(all laugh) and that Kalos meant Jhon would’ve been ushurped up totally(all laugh),9th finally Unova(all laugh) absolute win cause all you needed is to say first you were 6 time champ(all laugh) then just go to a gym and say my bro said great match i’ve a Latios(all laugh) so 301 for sure so 7 leagues or shared 8th league(all laugh) but Elite4 is all about Jasu’s lackies(all laugh)..but before that bro had any of us been there with you at Unova different game would’ve been wouldn’t it..”
Ash(smile) : “surely any of you or even Dawn you know cause i had to look after her(both May and Ash laugh)..yeah,Dawn was my travel companion at Sinnoh contests then 16 i was 26,Brock 31 namecalled us 8th day anniversary(all laugh) she is named as lady Dawn(all laugh) too ladied up then for her own sanity(all laugh) now Dawned up so at Kanto won the grand conference here at last and now is in Orange with her beau Oliver who is a Johto conference champ but she isn’t participating just travel companion too much longing(all laugh) finally ladied down(all laugh)...Cilan and Iris there were great friends but Dave knows the best i can’t work without siblings or wife being around me(all laugh) cause i turn on the whole world if i don’t get looked after(all laugh) and Dawn would’ve just kept those pests at bay by massacaring(all laugh) the two others there were utter gentle persons and Cilan has been in touch for long Iris then after that fled the scene(all laugh) but contacted the very day Melody did first and was so happy to talk with me now married with a kid Hoenn title won after Unova and all and then Kalos i was too wicked a pro(all laugh) and no Dave we would’ve still met no matter the undercover as we did in 1st round(all laugh) that if i was sane would’ve kept you in contact and may be thus the undercover as well cause i knew my bunch was my bunch then(all laugh) and still i would’ve been not alone as you know Mist herself jumped to Tlplocus group would’ve followed me there(all laugh) wanted to go to Unova kept her down for sake of mom and the family which then wouldn’t have been in my mind and then it would’ve been something indeed with rocket duo(all laugh) Meldoy you surely know the rockets behind us(all laugh,Meldoy says,’cunningly(all laugh)’..) and Melody at Kalos and Mist at gym both needed that Sinnoh cup(all laugh) so just the origianl being not with mom(all laugh) cause i didn’t need that to prove that i won it cause i would’ve had Melody’s replica and would’ve told them search the month before or after(all laugh)..no i just wished i dragged Trace there cause Professor ever encouraged them to broden the horizon leving their won work cause my bunch was such and i was asking them the exact questions intentionally that was out of their specialization(all laugh)..just was naive then(all laugh)...but what about Jasu’s lackies..”
David(laugh) : “well drawing contests are easy(all laugh)..”
May(laugh) : “cause you can’t draw beautiful scenes of lawful pleasant only illegal wars(all laugh)...”
Melody(laugh) : “well the drawings Jasu and McShin saw were too sweet(all laugh)..”
David(laugh) : “Jasu had a great day out(all laugh) first got Zekromed(all laugh) then that and i guess given selections like this you will get Unova(all laugh) win sure,Kanto may be(all laugh) this Melody herself will figure out,Hoenn against Ivana could’ve been a match of century really with your absolutely similar styles but with bro i will give it to Melody(all laugh) too cunning(all laugh) then Jasu means just win(all laugh) then Orange – win,Kalos- win Persy has no chance against Melody’s style(all laugh) barely managed it against Ivana’s predecessor Dorothy same type she was and then Lance(all laugh),Johto – win,so 5 definitely with 6th being the simple poem(all laugh) but what about Lance,Melody”
Melody(laugh) : “a Ketchum for a family day/if hallucinations are added Lance 30 minutes and see yourself in the bay...John used to tell me about bro and his antics(all laugh) with that none can win(all laugh) but what is bro’s method of Ivana killing and Lance taming(all laugh) and also add 5 minute strategies...”
Ash(laugh) : “well i’ve been in my reminiscences as you know i do it’s just about a family gathering at night sometimes which was going for full 2 months after that show(all laugh) Dave joined one day for his experiences under the cover(all laugh) and in those Melody you’ve been slaughtered the most(all laugh)..”
Melody(laugh) : “Gyarados would’ve never left you had i been at Hoenn(all laugh)..how was the experience May(all laugh)..”
May(laugh) : “ if it was said that Ash that girl looks cute yeah just Mist(all laugh) 1:15 talk 6 days a week and after reunion where Misty met us at Jabonsburg after about 12 months exactly since we started then she had the Gyarados and thus too longing(all laugh) 7 days talk(all laugh) and Misty was playing the gym leader version which first got bro too chrarmed(all laugh) but then absolutely disgraceful cause the Gyarados verion was so easy for him to manipulate(all laugh)..”
Melody(laugh) : “that is for sure(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “Gyarados was 1 or 2 weeks away from confessing herself(all laugh) and that too at my own home(all laugh) yeah she passed 1 month after Orange at my home(all laugh) 5 years 24/7 with me each day(all laugh) so her sisters spoiled my plans by calling her back(all laugh) anyway, about Lance well you surely know about the way my matches played against in whole Elite4 all the way since most of Kalos(all laugh) and my little red sis knows the bro matches too well(all laugh) but i was in reminiscences telling them what can defeat Lance it was that Lance is so self established you can’t play mind games with him cause he will have an answer to all and his bunch wants to enjoy a competitive race with all mind games and all possible but at the end no matter the result of the distance of of the finish line from start it’s just friendship for them Lance has endeared himself to the whole world with his utmost gentlemanly heart and sportsmanship and honesty as we all know how big a legend he is so the only way to beat him is to race him but do that indifferently to confuse them as to your seriousness and motivation behind racing to make them doubt themselves why they themselves are racing at all(all laugh) so that is to be done by being dejected and joyous at life at the same time(all laugh) to confuse him about the purpose of racing(all laugh) cause the competition is that the opponent wants to discuss philosophy as well during race while patting Lance’s bunch to the finish line to see if they understood that win and loss didn’t really matter(all laugh) disconnect his bunch from him by saying like my beau left me(all burst into laughter) but no not what you think just died aged(all uncontrollbaly laugh,.) but yeah the other one i’m interested in now a days for the illegal bit(all uncontrollbaly laugh).. has a few kids who are rather well behaved for their age(all burst into laughter)...illegal means other types at lab or bunch(all laugh) and if in season one is selected then rejected the new is illegal(all laugh).. this if continues like this would give a symbol that the race isn’t a factor cause my bunch is indifferent to life enjoying the race AS the life not WITH the life that’s the difference(all laugh and .) so if so it means racing as life in their sense is that as their life goes on the race to to their job and so long a prolonged life and in human life and theirs it’ll decimate the battle instinct(all laugh) and Lance will have to budge cause his bunch will tell him that why are you not allowing us to give a thought on thought that life is long with turns if not twists(all uncontrollbaly laugh,.) then your bunch should feed the twists too to rev it up(all burst into laughter) and so on just make the race mental(all laugh) thus they are lost in thoughts are if the thoughts are interesting to them to get indifferent to things like battling Lance isn’t helping them ever(all laugh) so that’s for a plan Melody(all laugh)..”
Melody(laugh) : “cunning(all laugh)...will take years to do this against someone like Lance(all laugh) if not lives(all laugh) generally you will go for dictating the pace of racing saying strange things and so on atmost trash talking(all laugh) but this isn’t ever happeneing unless your bunch can think independetly despite you to keep this stuff going and make it seem real to cut the opponents connection whicle your bunch being independent your connection to them is ever hidden or even if detected you can do absolutely nothing about it cause your bunch is free from you(all laugh) or even if Lance’s bunch is independent of him the moment he sends them saying battle he has lost the match cause my bro doesn’t want to at all(all laugh) and if exactly this plan i set up my bunch will still be at bay when Lance tries to shorten the distance of the race by telling them to answer by crying their heads off saying thier beaus left them(all laugh) cause then bro’s bunch will tell them why not me(all burst into laughter) and if they then will be taught how to starve(all laugh) there’s no way Lance can win once he has set up the idea that he wants to battle cause then ultimately their bunch will get tired(all laugh) and bro infact has been doing that since Orange but then it was upto him only so he did fumble here and there cause he still did want to win(all laugh) but then that was extremely well veiled(all laugh) and none suicides(all laugh) but now the bunch themselves doesn’t want to battle at all so they are perpetually fresh thus cunning(all laugh) and bro can fumble all he wants cause no connection(all laugh) and bro never wanted to win after few months in Unova cause as we know baiting Jasu is so much more fun(all laugh) really if that taste is there none would be serious(all laugh) all mental and his bunch is only looking for that chink in armour and if that’s not there it’s ever a draw what happened with Lance(all laugh) or even there with extremed intelligence still they may give up cause none calls their master a brat(all laugh) and having a bunch that is independent of you totally yet stays with you is a family that isn’t happening in a millennia as they say(all laugh) what a plan(all laugh)..but in 5 minutes Alakazam vs Alakazam(all laugh) what’s up but before that Dave you were told this plan for sure(all laugh)..?”
David(laugh) : “surely and in 10 rounds did win only 3(all laugh) well for Lance getting a 6-4 means you won(all laugh) and Persy got 4-6(all laugh) none won after extra time at 5-5 and i was at heavens when i led him 1-0 there(all laugh and cheers for David) yeah,too easy from here(all laugh) then he got me in the end by fooling around with me(all laugh) then smoked me off last round and then said yeah life is hard(all laugh) and very few has got 6-4 as well..but what about 5 minutes..”
Ash(laugh) : “well i was saying then Alakazam’s medicine is to feed him with serious ideas like world in ideas and wills rather than all this crap(all burst into laughter) so Alakazam being a fighting type psychic too seriously will lecture you on that and keep feeding him till he doesn’t know where he is and then jump him(all laugh) Melody picked up this plan that day as Whimsicott got overconfident and the fighting spirit meant Whimsicott was disadvantaged cause he became more playfull and went but Solgaleo wasn’t going to budge at all no matter what game(all laugh) and that was just that incessent psychic stuff that was psychic in nature yet was like dark type so incessent and that’s what a psudeo-legend does but he had to be calm to release that which he being Madgaleo didn’t(all laugh) Alakazam was supreme that day no doubt but the final isn’t spoken of why so Melody(all laugh)..”
Melody(laugh) : “cause once Madgaleo was out of competition with Tyranitar the great Harold Bower 6 league in 8th  region became just sweet little Harold McShin(all laugh) so too easy(all laugh) but still bro was favourite and once he was gone was fine but Hoenn was different stuff with Snorlax of all(all laugh)...”
May(laugh) : “well i have one but too serious(all laugh) but how can you feed him ideas at 5 minutes unless you forcefeed like saying don’t you too agree(all laugh) but this can be suspicous(all laugh)”
David(laugh) : “well i guess you have to say my bunch discusses such things does yours(all laugh) then once he comes up with something twist the answer and give another saying but what if(all laugh)...what does Melody say to counter it..”
Melody(laugh) : “then isn’t it so becomes but i thought that and that i saw was like you in this situation but this didn’t help them(all laugh) and this will open up the mind games meaning May and Drew will always draw it out(all laugh)...”
May(laugh) : “bro these two old goons are preying upon me(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “well then the answer becomes this i see battle(all laugh) but this battle do you represent your master’s emotions or moods(all burst into laughter)..emotions mean the fondling part and mood is battling(all laugh and .) cause see at your age the issues that you face(all burst into laughter) so because this battle will finish and we will not see each other again(all laugh) why don’t we give a thought on thoughts of the thought that comes to all as a thought(all laugh) that is associeted with life but what is this life at all(all laugh) what is a thought and how is it so(all laugh) this life,this thought/whoose with you,for whom what you brought(all laugh)/this idea to please my beau,think of it am i not you(all laugh and .)..this is my Noivern in thoughts and many more with Butterfree to say am i not you in poems(all laugh)..Butterfree tamed a dragon legend named Arsoductyphorus(all laugh)..and surely Melody knows the Kalos final don’t you(all laugh,Melody says ‘minutely(all laugh)’)..this all will confuse the opposing Alakazam as to why is he there(all laugh) first and then second what was can he learn from his opponent as to what is the right dating approach(all laugh) eventually will get lost cause this is honest opinion(all laugh) and if he can’t breed then the sentimental card gets the brat to think even more(all laugh) so 5 minutes in the last second when his master is chiding him give the full shot so that there’s no return at all cause even when he does won’t be as good as you(all laugh)...”
David(laugh) : “honestly dishonest hallucinations(all laugh and .)...”
Melody(laugh) : “from this if only May has connection to his bunch can she be beaten else not(all laugh) as no matter what Alakazam say the answer will be the same and that was bro’s technique no way out(all laugh) and the food Alakazam is fed is important cause if he has battled for 5 years it won’t help even if disconnected from master this mutual understanding is just impossibly great(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “well you see it’s not a secret but just forced by my bunch(all laugh) then about Ivana well she is too intuitive like Melody but her thing is that she is more serious than Melody giving her the disadvantage(all laugh) so it’s just surprizing her to an extent where the seriousness has to take over(all laugh) so if Alakazam says i can’t know you and you can’t know me cause i’m not you and you’re not me as you can’t tell me who i really am cause you give your ideas of only who i’m(all laugh) but you can be you and i can be me cause i do see you and you do see me so if you know you only as different to me then is it not true that you already know me(all burst into laughter,.) this is from my Palkia and again Butterfree(all laugh) combined circular logic and metaphysics(all laugh) this is enough for any legendary challenger to return to the pokeball(all laugh) well this plan will get Lance off the track every time or anyone(all laugh)..well the age realted thoughts will too(all laugh)..all about being honestly dishonest(all laugh)..”
Melody(laugh) : “yeah i really do want to restart now(all laugh and cheer for Melody) but only by sabotaging my hubby(all laugh)...and that logic will take 3 minute so 5 minute victory every match(all laugh)...but then how’s Ash Jr(all laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “not cunning yet(all laugh) i’ll let Dave do this..”
David(laugh) : “well bro will do the sensei part(all laugh) i say Eric Harrison and how he does,and my prediction is that he will continue as gym leader cause both mom and dad will be that so i guess and for all that the name Melody suggests have you ever been associeted with fire types(all laugh)..”
Melody(laugh) : “Victini,Chaneldure,Blaziken(all laugh and .) and Houndoom(all laugh)..so you can guess(all laugh)...”
May(laugh) : “everyone is after my poor Blezi..bro(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “according to my Dragonite because he had evolved into this form it’s implausible why one can’t devolute(all burst into laughter)..so get down to Torchic(all laugh) and take my Volcanion(all laugh)...”
David(laugh) : “Volcanion indoor is extremely discomforting(all laugh) so lets see Eric’s ways as a gym leader at psychic types all one needs to do is to home at Safforn forest(all laugh)...well Kanto and Johto will have to be travelled and may be 4 years rather than 3 or even 5 depending upon travel companions and then Orange not so crucial but Goodra,Aegislash,Chanedlure,Hoopa,Confragigus,Giratina,Latios,Ultranercozma,Hydreigon,Zygarde absolutely must(all laugh) so as usual Unova of all places(all laugh) definitely and now sensei all your game...”
Ash(laugh) : “i see Ash Harrison 1st region Kanto -win,2nd Johto -win follow mommy absolutely(all laugh),3rd Kanto Frontier – win,4th Orange- not win i think barring own talents with so much talent in family sometimes you slip into a lethergy as to why continue this why not another profession(all laugh) lost in thoughts(all laugh) then will be chided at home melodiusly though(all laugh) then 5th Hoenn – win,6th Sinnoh – win,7th Unova of all Karapaskars(all laugh) – win,8th Kalos – lose cause be it single or in company will lose interest(all laugh) then will be compassionately played the sentimentally friendly parents card(all laugh) at Elite4 absolute 7-0 no doubt(all laugh) and i had similar prediction for Gilbert and Olympia will be close but may not get 7 cause too interested(all laugh) so may be some good rivalries as well but tell the brats not to fight each other make that damn hall of fame with the leadership position family monopoly(all laugh) and infact with 300 and Jasu(all laugh) we can have an advanced burgain there as well(all laugh) but anyway whatever they do i have best wishes and with my connections and all yours as well now they can get best helps everywhere in almost all things regarding our profession and my connections will do all they can for sure(all laugh) and even for universities(all laugh) Venturiastrog is pretty known and Mr Tracey Skechit was there for 7 months then fled the scene(all laugh) after getting great grades at the only semester completed there in of all studies Mathematics(all laugh) but i have attended 2 lectures there(all laugh) abstruse topics in monastic philosphy(all laugh,.) to get my process set to do those antics and more so cause my bunch is crazy(all laugh) need as many sharpening methods of nerves as possible to understand what they are upto(all laugh) but as Dave was telling me to and even May will agree that she only likes the second round like uneducated people do(all laugh) and Melody will be too happy with this cause this is a great veil to hide behind to hallucinate even more(all laugh) so in gyms and competitons as THE MOTTO i say along with my Chu and Tauros(all laugh) 
this earth,this sun/prolong the joy,battle slowly run(all laugh and .)/in this very day,why do you say ney/fought you but not now,so lets not stay(all laugh)/match is done but never the thought/cause i’m hungry,next who’s brought(all laugh)/see this hunger ever on top/please tell me never to stop(all laugh and .)...so May what about your motto of education(all laugh)...”
May(laugh) : “motto is enough to fetch victories by default(all laugh) exactly what you did at Hoenn physically then Frontier mentally and then Sinnoh actually(all laugh) Unova your brats picked it up(all laugh) and Kalos and Elite4 better not be said of the ELOQUENCE(all laugh) telling dad for sure and the contest 2nd round opening theme(all laugh) but going to university means the students will have to flee home(all laugh)...well i’m fleeing now cause Drew can’t remain shrew anymore so he would spew(all burst into laughter),bye but cunning-sis,the family will prey upon you now...(all laugh,and reciprocate,bye)..”
David(laugh) : “yeah i’ll be entagled in legal matters as well unless i follow suit,so bye too and again for Melody sis welcome to familial competitions we’re hungry what have you bought(all laugh and reciprocate,bye)...”
Melody(smile,few minutes later) : “no really bro all this in 8/9 days from those 57 minutes per month 11 years never knew why i was so interested about you and felt a strong bond all are so happy we are really a refreshed version off illusion..”
Ash(smile) : “i’m only too happy for you sis cause i’ve ever felt that pain first cause the professional loss from part of the whole society then later i realized that you really were my sis much like May and May i met at Hoenn itself then 16 she was first region with a Torchic didn’t know a thing(both laugh) first day can i call you big bro too sweet came along same still been 16 long year her little bro max travelled with me and Brock through Hoenn and frontier from 13 to 17(both laugh) same absolutely no difference in character now general breeder and his wife Mia recently married she is supplimentary and swelling substances specialist(both laugh) and May and Max are children of Mr Norman Maple and Mrs Catherine Maple Pettlesburg Gym,normal type Hall of Fame,Hoenn they are like my own parents or uncle and aunt same and i met May just at the start of Hoenn and you were just may be 2 months before i met and you were so extremely talented i never got your too friendliness and never realized that you wanted your bro and especially those Kalos days all the time you said can’t concentrate i ever said just the bunch look at them when time came i had to look at so many other things to get out and my advantage was that i was 4 league champ at Unova as 7th region with that crazy bunch that hidden ego of 12/13 years went away cause of the mental pressure trying to appease those brats(both laugh) and well the whole world knows Feraligator only says i want to fool around with this and against that in my language it’s perfect philosophy(both laughter) so i really had to know them to get the joy cause they can’t express in our language what they have and i get there as we all do but this language is nice(both laugh) and i ever had the pay no attention to other gender unless family attitude cause of the ego and ideas and all mixed hence the strict professionality(both laughter) my brats got that out from me as well and the undercover was just heinous in terms of personal experience and that helped so i finally get your attitude and who you really are to me in reality but that means i will now babysit you and johhny boy as well(both laugh) and about the break-up which was cause Mist shut a door for 15 minutes in the meantime i was in battlefield cause Mist didn’t open after 2 minutes and she cause after 2 minutes i didn’t knock(both laugh) and then you know in Unova i got humiliated in public and then my and Mist’s trust broke just an illusion i had the ego and confusion she never ego but ever confused with my behaviour and if i really was her soulmate or not that thing same as me and then undercover then again Kalos there universities as i said libraries all sorts wasn’t alright at all then finally after all get Mist back only waiting she was for me all time time and all that but you called 4 days ago that was some experience i’m myself just over the moon really we all are and the outside family too when they know more it’s really great to see you back and have you back and you with the two sweet dolls of yours and John are in family absolutely and you can be yourself all you want now your husband is here but we all are now Dave himself did tire you out i guess with the undercover stuff(both laugh) same as May as you see and will more and May helped you to plan(both laugh) and all Tracey,Gary,Brock and Daisy,Lillie,Violet all are like this the waterflower sisters you know more than me(both laugh) Gary is same his dad is Professor’s son sadly no more among us his name was Mr William Oak and he infact just about got started in his career after 19 the completion of formal studies for researcher and was observer like Trace went out first 2 years at Kanto completed his journey and his schoolmate really was my aunt Mrs Gloria Altman Oak and studied together as well as travelled together and met at the age of 10 just in school and relatinship since 13 (both laugh) and anyway then after completion of first journey married and all was so great Gary came but then my aunt so unfortunately for all of us could’nt  bear the joy of unearthing such a pure jewel went into abstraction day 1 and then uncle lived till he was 10.5 just school started and then an accident went inside his mind and then well he lacked guidence hence in his early days was very good in his first Kanto journey got a Tapu Koko and Victini(both laugh) but you know he is and surely was even at 10 the one and only in type specifications(both laugh) then after Kanto one year break 6 month study went to Johto was not so good but still good enough there 1st round got me we were arch-rivals since 0-21(both laugh) and infact i spent more time at his home than he the lab that is(both laugh) then got me round one Johto first round sadly Larvitar after pestering Brock for 2 years double evolved to mega Tyranitar(both laugh) and still pestering Gary since then for 16 years now(both laugh) infact my Larvitar hatched after 2 months in my 1st  month of journey itself staring from the oth when started got him from Professor Naomi and just at the 2 year completion when they can barely evolve double evolved to mega form(both laugh) and the rest is known he is just 18 but inreality about 45(both laugh) and still will live for 82 years more i guess(both laugh) anyway,Tracey had all but they wanted him to become a scholer pokemons weren’t allowed at home about 20 years twice a year call that’s it later now all too happy,Brock again you know everything just so naive(both laugh) and you know about my parents so we’ve been gelled like this as well out of nowhere and Dave similar exactly like Brawn(all laugh) and thus being opposite to Sabrina(both laugh) well Dave’s whole family is including Zara(both laugh) and she’s a lawyer(both laugh) well Dave stayed a month more after winning 4th title in 4th region before going to Orange cause that was his birth month(both laugh) and 4 time champ celebration etc then was runners up in extra time at Orange comes back you know too interested so will jump to the next to understand what wrong he did but wanted to take one month break to decide whether Unova or Kalos infact Sinnoh fears Kanto more than Unova(both laugh) comes home family kicks him out last time 2 month stayed cause of birth month we forced you immediately leave or emotions will affect your thinking that you lost because of that(both laugh) great people really but do you know about SPEW(both burst into laughter)...”
Melody(laugh) : ”delay the cleaning to picture first to VEIL the infatuation,shrewd(both uncontrollbaly laugh) ..”
Ash(laugh) : “and then they DREW(both burst into laughter)..really man,Drew has ever been pestered so much that too by Madgaleo vs Flygon cause it’s a dragon(both laugh)..his contact is Shrew a sort a Drew(both burst into laughter)..really he has been the comic relif(both laugh)..and well his bro-in-law little bro little Max(both laugh) he left school at the age of 13 to immitate his big Torchic(both laugh) i went to their home first after meeting May and then the little pest says i will go as well so then may negotiations for a day(all laugh) and May was so insecured was relieved to have her big bro as travel companion really and straingt went home so happy(both laugh) really as i say eternal connection and you’re just a bit late cause you’re older to me that too by 3 months(both laugh) so then Max says i’ll come very intelligent boy ever got a double promotion so would’ve finished at 14 and then 2 years of tiring journey through the special school and he already knew too many things about Silvally(both laugh) so school was finished on journey itself(both laugh) and speciality too(both laugh) then was at Hoenn after i finished my Frontier and he finished Hoenn in 2.5 years as a trainer went out of 1st round already knew that wasn’t for him still continued and somehow qualified within the main time to the main league as well but too fondled bunch again and only had 20 anyway(both laugh) cause the starter was a Corpish sadly(both laugh) so naive(both laugh) and hence went to general breeding went to Johto for 2 years and before that the 2 year study so in 7 years he was all fine when he was 24 already too experience and too much good(both laugh) and his wife Mia too similar that gruelling 6 year course upto 22 for all sorts of suppilments and of course the illegal things(both laugh) same age as Max were travel companions in Johto then the eventual(both laugh) and they returned stayed 8 months for another part of the degree and both went out together to Sinnoh again for two years returned then one and half years then married just 4 months ago the month prior to our show and they are too simple both and desperate simulators like if you say i felt very happy when a certain person congratulated me cause he was very important for my career at that stage means they will try to recollect how they felt in similar situations and if not found themselves will try to congratulate others or cajole them to to the same(both laugh) this whole family actually barring me just so naive(both laugh) and Johnny boy went to Pewter 1st(both laugh) and hence wants to go to Ymulotus too much bonhomie(both laugh)..no really i like to think as a link throughout lives cause we had no reasons to come together like this i infact broke-up and broke off from all these 4 years no peace now so happy and you know what i’m talking about so many twists and turns in our lives and finally with our soulmates and so on so i atleast love to believe(both smile) so just that we don’t want any of the pain even if you still have of those illusions we’re ever open armed to genuine people and you and your family more than that just have no hesitations ever the initial days once go out all will be joke and fun surely so yeah welcome to the family dear little sis(smile,Melody smiles as well)...”
Melody(smile) : “i’m only ever so happy for my luck that only took 16 more years to fool around with me unlike serious Alakazams(both laugh) but the trouble is that neither me nor you can finish 38 years today itself so will have to go(both laugh)..so before that your 2 words(both laugh) and that marriage oath will do me a lot(both laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “well the 2 wrods my first proposal to Mist was a funny one next one was very serious for which it will take you to know the full history don’t rush(both laugh)...the first one was that after coming to the gym she was portreying a responsible gym leader character affectionate wise old big sister to the whole world(both laugh) i myself was so fascinated cause a gym Magikarp evolved into her great Gyarados(both laugh) in the reunion that May was speaking of it Mist released that Gyarados against a Shedninja(both laugh) and flamethrow and she in 11 months became so self established from being just a very good water type trainer fascinated me cause in 11 months that little playmate of mine Mist had become that gym leader that really is so much better than you but comes down at your level that stuff and then next 8 months i was rather deluged by her new personality charm(both laugh) but then she was going overboard says such is life(both laugh) these things incensed me cause you know about that dance(all laugh) 2 weeks away she was from herself confessing to me was stammering the words on that week(both laugh) but then suddenly went off and then that big sister stuff i was stunned and dejected as i thought why am i rejected(both laugh) Mist is exactly a Gyarados with me since day 1(both laugh) all the outside grace and all is only there if i’m fed upon each day(both laugh) totally blind she is since the first moment she saw me doesn’t know anything else and thus the Gyarados was there to hide that(both laugh) and her other demand is that if i call her Misty it’s a serious offence cause Misty is a different girl she to me is Mist(both laugh) i called her Mist first time after my 3rd ever badge after 1 month a bit more of familiarity and that meant i’ve married her to actually both of us(both laugh) so in the last months of Hoenn i was calling her Ms Misty Waterflower Cerulian City Gym Leader much honoured am i to be able to talk with you(both laugh) so dejected(both laugh) barely managed tears then came to my home stayed for a month(both laugh) and she first time came to my home after Orange and calls my mom mom 3rd day and scoffs at me in front of her(both laugh) and i whispered to her and blew air in her ears in front of mom(both laugh) and these went on for a month as well cause 5 years 24/7 with me without any break(both laugh) so at my hometown since then all know i’m married(both laugh) then she goes to my home still the big sister so i get no signals(both laugh) then i decided to prey upon her(both laugh) so we left for Frontier May,Max,me and Brock and first was that frontier symbol near Cerulian can’t recall which villege as Frucient(both laugh) now one of my lackie’s pet(both laugh) and grass has been turned to water for obvious reasons(both laugh) Saul is there he is double Orange Frontier was Kanto,Orange Elite4 office bearer,skirmish fixed it too devoted now(both laugh)..huge stories all around all in good times(both laugh) anyway,then we 4 went out of my home and Mist was travelling with us would see us off at Cerulian we go to mount moon(both laugh) May and Max first experience of moon dance there cause i was 2 time champ and Mr Maple was hall of fame gym leader that too with normal types(both laugh) first time i saw cause Mist and Brock both were gym leaders and Brock was yet to totally give up his role of anti-naivety(both laugh) and then at that night i made her cry by being intentionally harsh to get rid of the big sister mask(both laugh) and the method is very easy infact at our first meeting you hugged me and i praised you totally distraught(both laugh) comes back sobbs(both laugh) Ash i’m not a trainer like you but i..i too beat you in the semi final of that water cup..that too was hard competition only water type but i..i beat you too at the semi final(both laugh) then i got what she wants i said Mist um..Misty..’..cries and says ‘shut up!namecall competitor is a girl and i become Misty..Misty...5 years Ash 5 damn years and you’ve been calling me Mist and today..today..I’M NOT MISTY(both laugh)..’ called her Mist after very first month for both that was the real marriage(both laugh) and yeah called her Mist also cause i had just faced Brawn(both laugh) but that name means she is my wife and Misty is a different girl(both laugh) and it still goes on now is ‘37 years too old hum Ash’..(both laugh)..so i get her in that way saying i too have responsibilities(both laugh) then next day forced her to invite us saying are we not allowed in the gym(both laugh) then she thinks i’ll propose we reach Cerulian and i say i’ll go there at night you please proceed i’ll have lunch outside one of my friends are here hangout(both laugh) i have 4 bossom friends here at Cerulian Harris top grass trainer has a group in gym and Tony electric has a group in gym(both laugh) and police too(both laugh),Kane open ocean specialist breeder extremely sought after throughout Kanto and Braum flying type specialist also on ocean and of course everywhere else(both laugh) and similar name all are really on top of their profession and Tony has a coast guard group and Harris is indespensible as much in Cerulian as he is Frucient where my pet Saul is the current gym leader(both laugh) all of them know each other too well as well and all 5 of us and our other halves as well Mist’s schoolmate Irene is Kane’s wife is a pokemon doctor here specializing on water types(both laugh) so many times at gym and Oak Labs too whole city wants her(all laugh) she is at Gossberg Starter gym here whole world knows it water type starter open ocean stuff too famous(both laugh) also hence the bonhomie(both laugh) and Kane’s sister Hana is our main referee Victor’s wife who is 2nd son of the resident main staffs Sarah who sees the official things and her husband Brauch who is reservation head so you understand about the bonhomie(both laugh) and yeah,Harris and Kane are my schoolmates as well(both laugh) rest to met on travel,Tony was Drew’s travel companion in Hoenn of course(both laugh) know him so well and his wife Olivia is Braum’s long time friend and was his travel companion for 2 regions as well,both of whom i met during Johto and later Hoenn where she met Tony boy(both laugh),Olivia is a SPECIALIST PSYCHIC TRAINER(both laugh) so has a group at the gym as well(both laugh) and city police and so on(both laugh) Cerulian’s Johnny post(both laugh) and then Harris’ wife Brenda is a general breeder(both laugh) while Braum’s wife Flavia is also water type specialist breeder and Kane’s comrade(both laugh) and both Brenda and Flavia are long time friends hence Flavia won the toss of less studies(both laugh) Brenda was Harris’s travel companion across Orange and Hoenn so aww(both laugh) so you see strange and so happy connections and so much geniality(both laugh) just so naive(both laugh) so all of them too well known to me and in between a big family really and you see i can’t work without such environments cause i have to be free like wasting your precious time as i’m doing now(both laugh) cause my brats for last 9 years is advising me to become jovial(both laugh) and i tried to be when i first proposed Mist so then used one of these 4 pals of mine to excuse my absence from the gym and group for the day and it was Harris who got the chop then(both laugh) and i say i’m not going to gym so Mist again cried and all then i go there at the gym after closing hours big sisters very angry doesn’t want to let me in i say please i want to see a certain Cloyster that i heard from Gary(both laugh) this gets Lillie out of way and Daisy was implied that she was first despite Lillie allowing me in wanted to throw me out family schism and then i was a 2 league champ with a bit of name for myself surely i deserved respect and ego(both laugh) they had to let me in go to the reservation of course(both laugh) and then i call Mist via the main inspector Brauch whom i still pester each day and call him Brauchy man and he’s 63 now(both laugh) and Flavia i said Braum’s wife specialist water breeder is in queue Brauch knows her too well only(both laugh)anyway,i call Mist to reservation via Brauch and she comes thinks that it’s time so too happy takes me to that corner(both laugh) and then i say ‘mam professionality(both laugh) now from Mist to ‘mam profusely cries then scoffs at me unstammered that i reject you(both laugh) i say yeah as a best friend(both laugh) totally bewildered as to what she should do then i said we’ll always be best friends(both laugh) says don’t create a drama i’m leaving(both laugh) then i turned her towards me and hugged her then first word in terms of intterogation in this tone ‘attitude?’ (both laugh) this gets her down as she realizes that finally after 8 years it’s that time(both laugh) so we hug each other a bit then the obvious but reservation was public place no matter so i said in this tone ‘privately(both laugh)’ that’s two words rest actions in privacy(laugh,Melody laughs and .s) but the irony of being a trainer is the next to next day out for 1.5 years Hauntering villeges like Hazelex(both laugh) then in brief after that thunder chair in Sinnoh she and me both wanted to marry and settle down but my bunch became battle starved(both laugh) so i had to go to Unova and all the next 7 years so many things broke-up and all then i had become who i’m now cause you know what brats i have to mingle with cause they do if i don’t(both laugh) and finally that 30 minute pictured realization(both laugh) came back wasn’t sure if she was married or not challenged her in a gym match fooled around she was depressed severely all of those was to humiliate her in public to get that ego out cause then new hall of fame and all the name and all people took her as a deity and that got upto her nerves in making her think thus she has a huge responsibility thus that big sister mask later just as i was gone sucked her life out even more and then i did what i do going to water gyms with Tauros and Donphan(both laugh) and Emboar and Typhlosion(both laugh) there i used water pokemons though(both laugh) i took those whom she knew very well in 5 years travel and she had my Glalie for 2  years or more herself and so on then very upset later that night broke into her room by means of subtle bodies and psychics who brought my physical body later(both laugh) anyway i was in physical body when woke her up(both laugh) and then gagged her and bound her by rubber tapes(both laugh) then said the brief points that she was my soulmate and thus eternally my wife and so on but the language was stren and invited her at Pallet(both laugh) where she came in the lab and then after 6 hours of long date(both laugh) just to make her realize that i never cared about the outside conditions of what she might’ve done in 4 years i want my Mist just and she wants me only as well in that way and we were soulmate this is the inevitability and so on took time for her to realize cause was in severe depression and all then the final marriage oath that was pretty big indeed all was conjured up by the philsophies and classes at universities as i said Venturiastrog(both laugh) then my own understandings and all so lets say Meldoy and John in the marriage ceremony on the spot(both laugh) and the oath will be in terms of what i said to Mist and later Mist said to Lillie and Gary for them to marry again(both laugh) so now the main part marry Jhon again today(both alugh) and later when we meet again(both laugh) so this was something like this,
Melody and John came close to each other for no reasons that was physical,mental,emotional,social,philosophical,psychological cause of the virtues and skills and so on no reason can be found for them to come close this means that their relation isn’t dependent upon any of the things that is called or termed as my the word is I that is Melody and John came close not because of Melody’s or John’s or Melody is or Jhon is thus it means Melody and Jhon is together cause of Melody and John only which is plausible thus only if Meldoy and John are not different in soul at all(smile,Melody smiles and .s) and so then keeping this in mind is the fact that the one reality that is soul abstract as no differences can be found between one and another from that level the ONE reality that by means of body and mind only that is also my not i thus Melody and John are apprearences only in reality they are not two but one so that One reality who is here appearing as Melody to John and John to Melody being the same means Melody is John and John is Melody so she who is appreaing as Melody and he who is apperaning here as John keeping this idea in the mind that they are one and same appearing differently to each other only to see themselves through a different body,if so agrees then may Meldo and John please answer my question that do you two want to get married to each other and yes they do that’s the 2nd proposal(laugh,Melody smiles and .s)...so how has been your experience(laugh)..”
Melody(smile) : “overjoyed i’m anyway bro this only enhanced it surely should’ve been at Kalos at a much much older age to get the right things but before should’ve travelled with you but even before why bother(both smile) so yeah so happy to have you all as family looking forward really for 37 more years atleast(laugh,Ash laughs as well)..well,better go now as Johnny lad is appearing differently to me thus is in deep waters by now(both laugh)...”
Ash(laugh) : “should be(both laugh) well yeah never bother about illusion just don’t that’s all and i’m so happy to get my little sis and her full family now that’s all but you’re invited here only if you agree to battle Mist Ketchum(both laugh)..”
Meldoy(laugh) : “verbally(both laugh)..well,see you soon bro and be prepared for cunning version next..bye(both laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “ever happily prepared bye see you anytime(both bye and reciprocate and all)...”
...................................................................................................................................
(10 days later,night,middle)

Ash(laugh) : “yeah before everything i must say on saturday night that brat from Kalos called(all laugh) well my phone is directed to by gym brats(all laugh) Norris said call has come this this and then those brats were blocked off so could’nt call me and then i say fine give me thier numbers and then i texted them,’senors(all laugh),how may i come in any service if i’m called(all laugh)’,then that brat calls and says,’Mr Ketchum hellow how are you’,’fine proceed(all laugh)’,’um..i’m a journalist now(all burst into laughter) so(all laugh)’,’costly magazines(all burst into laughter)..this you know ever my joke with those pests(all laugh)..then says,’um..no don’t be always so harsh you know(all laugh)..’,’look senor(all laugh),your trouble in linking ideas with persons has ever been your downfall(all laugh) except that whenever you tried your hands at anything you’ve been very well great cook,great writting skills on plethora of topics related to all except pokemons(all laugh),good business skills as good IT skills,freelance wrtiing and then bussiness with that,good communication skills(all laugh) and you’re perfect for journalism why roam around after pokemons when you were earning enough from home to maintain yourself and Kalos people of your kind can make great money if they get the right place then 2 years romig around with pokemon professionals(all laugh) and another in Unova of all places(all laugh) and contests for that matter the most dreaded place for contests cause the second round is Cobalion vs Terrakion(all burst into laughter)..’,’um..no i was studying there too for 10 months 1 month and a bit more only in contests got ony one more pokemons none wanted to stay(all laugh) so the Spinda reamains(all laugh) but Arsoductyphorus(all burst into laughter)..’,’i see but why magazine(all laugh)’,’way to the papers(all laugh) they gave the full 103 list infact(all laugh) Arsoductyphorus was tamed by your Butterfree(all laugh) well out of my pokemons there was a Butterfree(all laugh) well never wanted to stay but Butterfree was only one that evolved(all laugh) well Spinda doesn’t evolve(all laugh) but i entered one contest only and Butterfree got through to second round but then Spinda was against Kommo-O(all burst into laughter) 5 seconds(all laugh)..that brat must’ve told Spinda to dodge and that means her head was chopped off(all laugh)..well Butterfree never wanted to stay somehow managed him getting him riled up to get me through first round but turned on us immediately afterwards(all laugh) and then went off didn’t want to stay i finally and absolutely realized it’s not for me and journalism was right and thus doing for almost an year when i met you at hospital i was just about to return and anyway,just remembered your Butterfree and i had one myself thus called(all laugh)..’,’senor,what bugs you about a show(all laugh)’,’um..Mrs Misty..(all laugh)’,’Ketchum yeah(all laugh)’,’hey don’t always go back to that you know(all laugh) you’re married now and i...um..(all laugh)’,’tell me about a show and how that has got to give some thoughts on thoughts occurring in thoughts as thoughts accordigly as you proceed towards temporal transmigration(all burst into laughter)..’,’um..well yeah i understand soulmate(all laugh) Mrs Misty Ketchum..’,’yeah my soulmate that she showed to the world though the water performance show where i also was there to reciprocate that i’m her soulmate where is the trouble then Mr XYZABC is hesitating about the the place to give the ring(all laugh)’,’no not like that just the preliminaries(all laugh) but your wife is just so’,’sweet yeah(all laugh)’,’yeah that word and then she was very sweet when we spoke and Clemont is still in contact very much with me and also at Professor Oak’s lab where he is regular customer(all laugh) and he was told by Dr Oak that long ditance just was trouble then later was fine as that specific type according to Gary Oak(all laugh) when he questioned that we never knew about anyone(all laugh)’,’well you saw first hand what i doing there and what my bunch used to do senor have you come to the full realization  finally who took you under his wings from what position of his in his career(all laugh)’,’yeah Clemont always then itself told me to wake up(all laugh) but he again told me to hear your discussion with Doctor Brock Slate on dissent that feeling(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) i went through dad’s account and heard it was amusing Doctor Slate gave so many many views and the whole thing was excellent’,’so why i being the disciple have dissent(all laugh)’,’no i realize the dissent surely with your wife being such a person no matter the contacts and all that is understandable but..’,’you want a personal interview but i’ve no time(all laugh) or you want professional contact for which you’re among 2100(all laugh) and you as new 2102(all laugh)’,’yeah like Clemont but he’s in profession and very good at it and was listening to Treecko so always has had great contacts with you in professional terms as has Megan even later you’ve been too nice to them as Doctor Slate teaches one to be during right breaks(all laugh) and Bonnie went to other profession as well but she doesn’t have contacts with me either but way younger understanable was a 15 year old kid then just but..’,’yeah why the hesitation as XYZABC is here but still incognito(all laugh)’,’Shane Ferkins journalist newspapers actually long time friend you spoke with him a few times then but he was new then so never did the press and all direct with you but all remembers that famous press here during your Elite4 and knows you well but it’s just..’,’the whispers(all burst into laughter) that he isn’t liking your chatters that you did this and that and it bugs you’,’um..kinda(all laugh)..it’s..’,’not Spinda yeah(all burst into laughter),Spinda knows better than me that i was right when i said if the self is tried first rather the the ridiculous outside for which you were too obsessed hence your illusion and now no more after Kommo-O(all laugh) specially cause even my wife will have troubles beating that one if the water is enough for him to stand(all laugh) or swim(all burst into laughter) cause that’s psudeo legend fighting dragon world dreaded most difficult pokemon to tame(all laugh) and he charged at your Spinda you told her to dodge by the time your advice reached her Kommo-O was 360 sphere at her(all laugh) then chopped her in half cause doging is exactly what they are expecting and thus the first charge is totally false,hence Spinda knows what is what since she was born but you were trying to foist yourself upon her by trying to dictate her pace which she allowed you to but why answer that(all laugh)’,’um..well..um..she knows my heart and nothing else the outside hence..’,’exactly why she has remained with you so pokemons are great teachers but Kommo-O is may be the best demostrators aren’t they(all laugh)..’,’yeah Spinda is ever my soulmate but that demostration was still too harsh on her(all laugh) weeklong pokecentre but my opponent said your Butterfree is very good to get you through in the first round like this but you’re just starting don’t get too excited(all laugh) or try to get a Jangomo-O(all laugh) this one is 6th  generation my granddad managed to catch one somehow thus mine is the first one properly tamed(all laugh)..yeah if someone suddenly sees that one a feet away(all laugh)..anyway,but no Shane knows about these things but doesn’t it’s..(all laugh)..’,’suddenly wisdom dawns upon you after seeing a Kommo-O right in front of you(all laugh) that 5 league those mad pokemons then the jovial ones then my midnight travels(all laugh) and finally Crawdauntogator(all laugh) and then Celmont’s constant counselling that i wasn’t a great star and gracious playboy(all burst into laughter) but rather a cunning-old-pro(all laugh) thus Kalos Wisdom should’ve been used not the cultural nonsense that atleast you should be polite enough(all laugh) i know many people in Kalos excellent people but what is it with that idea of too much money(all laugh)’,’just that drive(all burst into laughter) it’s like if you have money you want more and so on and generally people are unlike Doctor Slate not niave(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) so they make it more difficult 30 years some 35 then philosophical(all laugh) so i’m 4 years quicker seeing a Kommo-O from very close quarters(all laugh)’,’yeah Kommo-Os are like that but(all laugh) why north-eastern Kalos is totally different to all other places there’,’yeah harsh weather so day-to-day cost of second cousin mask is like in Cerulian City Gym(all laugh,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..dad we perfectly understand them as we understand at that age the issues that mom faced(all burst into laughter)..really Trace how would you be firm with them(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “i’ll sent them to Heracross(all burst into laughter)..”
Misty(laugh) : “why not to your baby sis sweet sweet Trace(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “yeah,that hell would be left when at 16 they directly tell me ‘shut up!(all burst into laughter) never call me Jas how dare you nickname me(all burst into laughter)..mom only he likes..um..(all burst into laughter)..and then even more dangerously Blosie will ask me ‘dad! dad! why do you look at mom’(all burst into laughter)...”
Ash(laugh) : “just so naive(all burst into laughter)..anyway,then i continued,look it is an illusion everywhere many places are here in Cerulian itself that are trying to adopt Ivilstopstrog where the Kalos culture is at it’s peak frivolity(all laugh) and those from there still does so much after 25,30 why waste 5 years(all laugh) all cause the average life is most there so lets rock and roll for 5 more then regret it out the next 5 10 extra years and thus the average life expectency is equal to the other regions cause 10 years mental pressure hard(all laugh) let the brats dance to their tunes and follow the best people there who are exactly same from anywhere in the world yeah languages vary but once you meet them you realize they are true good people like Clemont of all people is from Barnastrog another infamous cultural spot still has good Univeristies and all why waste 10 years senor and then once you’ve got out of that why look back at it(all laugh) just illusion get rid of this mess(all laugh) which is exactly what your beau wants(all laugh)..’,’no that is ok but i feel bad that if that didn’t happen then like..(all laugh)’,’then you would’ve had a leeway to beak my head off on journalism(all laugh) and then my wife’s to know about the stories(all laugh) cause finally your only journey there and then Kommo-O made you realize that one needs to be a peoperly self established person to have family and all life as and of Kommo-O yeah exactly(all burst into laughter)..’,’um..Clemont was saying he has been talking with Dr Gary Oak there for 3 years very helpful and professional as Mr Oak(all laugh) and then Doctor Slate is a um..very NICE(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs in tears)..’..”
Brock(laugh) : “you brat will get me divorced(all burst into laughter) get off to Huntelion to appease your Kommo-O(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “for those brats and like Melody extremely good but that help and even May you know how right travel companion was needed or things like that but then was lady Dawn(all laugh) and so on i know many here and there Franklin i met at Unova now 2 time champ he’s 6 years younger to me and he was from Unova too egotistical he was then got that now now a great boy and then Pires i met at Kalos 5 years younger he is doing great now special training ground types and so on a few in Sinnoh that Brock saw they need you man they need you and hence they like you(all burst into laughter) cause of that feeling(all burst into laughter)..”
Brock(laugh) : “yeah i just hope Kommo-O doesn’t come around for discussions(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “if only a family WIDE trouble(all laugh)..at that professional age yeah(all burst into laughter)..when Mr Oak was as a duo personally impersonal looking at swings varying from wig to wig yeah(all burst into laughter)..Scyther(all laugh)..next will be family pain if son is away(all laugh) or well if baby sis stays at unofficial hubby home for a month at 19 calling his mom mom on 3rd day saying mom my hubby..um..friend(all burst into laughter)...anyway(all laugh),i told mom once this i guess was Sinnoh break or even before that just ask my sweet bug what if you ejected her off from home(all laugh),’8 years back and forth now too happy now i see(all laugh) bless yourself that Mist found you 1st day cause your ghosts wouldn’t have searched her out for you(all laugh)’ then i asked Mist many years ago the same question,’um..but you’re my Ash as well..(all laugh)..’,no really i was at Cerulian for 2nd badge surely would’ve asked her for a date there if met(all laugh) the word that Mr Oak Mr Oak couldn’t EXPRESS the same month(all laugh)...but still it hosted a jackal(all laugh)...but none of us would’ve been pests atleast(all laugh)..cause we would’ve asked after our Kamto journey ended only(all laugh)..by-the-way how did humans approached for a date Mrs Skechit(all burst into laughter)...”
Daisy(laugh) : “um..Mrs i mean(all laugh) Ms Waterflower Misty went there yesterday at Nile’s the food was good was saying you would um..like a professional..um..(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “in hangouts after i came in terms with the fact that my bee was in Hoenn actually(all laugh) the jackal used to go like um..yeah psychothrombonosis yeah that’s ok Misty(all laugh) but also similar process your eldest sis...(all burst into laughter)...crook asked me directly as that feeling(all laugh) that is she tired today no the mental..(all burst into laughter) but still there was Mr Oak as Gary wig(all laugh)..Mr Oak Mr Oak why were you so solemn(all burst into laughter)..”
Gary(laugh) : “yeah,understandable too happy with that brat of a retired husband(all burst into laughter)..”

Tracey(laugh) : “you brat i warn you(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “SCRAFTY(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “no,Hector says now sweet sweet bro(all laugh)..anyway,back to senor,then i say,’so you want to return in contacts’,’um..yeah once a month the ideas of Mrs Ketchum(all laugh)’,’Mrs Ketchum is a hall of fame gym leader of very very unique order that even Elite4 heads respect as something astonishing which simply means she has had to know too much about her own career to know about other things so from there how can she help your career(all laugh)’,’um..no her life is so sweet(all laugh)..’,’are you looking for personal interview with her(all laugh)..um..yeah can i(all laugh)’,’for magazine(all laugh)’,’hey don’t take that up(all laugh)..’,’senor,why are you hesitating to say as like my other travel companions you want to get in touch cause AH!THE LIGHT!THE LIGHT!(all burst into laughter)...what is your trouble with me that you’re not in my profession(all laugh)’,’um..no it feels like illusion(all laugh) i was in an illusion(all laugh) else with your inputs it would’ve been so easy in my current position cause we travelled throughout Kalos in so many places and it’s just feels so childish now that i was in illusion so now it’s just..(all laugh)’,’you want personal contacts back again but are unnecessarily shaky cause you don’t have any clue of my life except the fact that Mrs Misty Ketchum was very nice to you and is my dear wife for 21 long years(all laugh) you know only one travel companion of mine that is my little sis Mrs May Maple Blackmore and i guess you know about her and her husband as well(all laugh)’,’yeah i searched her career then unique career and Mr Drew Blackmore as well 3 straight draws and no troubles at all in personal life very unique but me being a travel companion..(all laugh)’,’what is Clemont’s current position’,’um..Clemont is in a great position as instruments specialist at Herman Starter Lab,Venturiastrog(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..exactly why Trace is in demand via Mr Oak cause i insinuated(all laugh) and he is of all instruments expert(all laugh)..Bonnie doesn’t have any contacts with us she is out of profession but doing well Clemont says at university now will be in advanced classes in colleges but still a big fan of yours cause her extra knowledge helps(all laugh)’,’good,when we travelled was i rich(all laugh)’,’um..you mean comfort no didn’t have absolutely any(all laugh)’,’right,was there moments when Malamar gang and Mamoswine herd was at us not in an exactly friendly manner(all laugh)’,’um..no and me with Clemont and Bonnie got separated from you duing the Malamar invasion(all laugh) and we had only Treecko who was more scared than Clemont(all laugh) and yeah we still didn’t like give in so..’,’exactly that was your first ever full travel in such situations and you and Bonnie was as couragious as ever and Clemont was too but he’s in profession always so i understand but Bonnie was little girl you were more than fine for sure on your own and then in Mamoswine’s case what happened(all laugh)’,’um..then Clemont was with Bonnie and i was with you that was very first experience that too at Roclkary montains of infamous places(all laugh) where you used Kyurem only to climb up then we were all alone(all laugh) so i was scared too much more so of your disposition cause Mamoswine herd was(all burst into laughter) cause you were trying to go there all alone(all laugh) then released Abomasnow only(all laugh) and told him to calm the herd down so that you may speak to them like in a formal dinner(all burst into laughter) i remember that cause Clemont and Bonnie was ok cause they hid themselves but i was absolutely in the middle of it(all laugh) and your antics scared me even more cause none wants a dinner with wild mad herds(all laugh) and then you just told me to remain calm and gave a pokeball saying this is Kyurem if only needed that is when these pests directly try to attack you then only release her else she will drag you right in the middle of Mamoswine herd not this one though she’ll choose herself she’s independent of me(all burst into laughter) and that is to introduce them to you and viseversa cause she doesn’t understand why you’re not a Mamoswine to begin with(all burst into laughter) cause you’re born(all burst into laughter) and don’t bother Mamoswines aren’t psychic(all laugh) and then i..um..(all laugh)..’,’yeah hugged me just go on(all laugh)’,’um..yeah,right(all laugh)..you just patted me saying while smiling that don’t bother just the formal introduction(all burst into laughter)..infact these things i never realized hence my illusion(all laugh) later during the 1 year of diffculties(all laugh) i realized the introduction was with Mamoswine food actually(all laugh) so anyway i thought opposite but then that was something then you said later you only went there to meet them cause they sneaked out of grasp when you were at Frontier cause you were naive then(all laugh)’,’no with Glalie(all burst into laughter) which is why i was not properly dressed to formally enter a civil home consisting a close knit Mamoswine family(all burst into laughter) so i breached the code of conduct there hence next time a ghost wasn’t used cause they take curtsey too early too happily(all burst into laughter) anyway,continue(all laugh)..’,’yeah,i can never forget these sort of words as none says them about Mamoswines or ghosts atleast(all laugh) anyway,then Mamoswine’s went to dine with you for some times then you were back i hugged you again thought so couragious(all laugh) and you were barly conscious and thus hardly able to stand so even hugged me back(all laugh) i was overjoyed in a way(all laugh) but Abomasnow nodded with much disapproval of your condition saying this is countering huh(all laugh),master brat is yet to understand the process of knowledge hidden in the desire to a certain abstuse plane that i can’t recall(all laugh) where it’s the knower of the unknown and the known is about to interchange hence Ms Senor don’t you agree that this idea to know the snow is the root of the reason for the snow to exist mentally that is(all burst into laughter) cause if no desire to react or to know why suddenly snow out and in the mind that is(all burst into laughter) i thought my translator has malfunctioned cause a pokemon is mastering his master(all laugh) actually forgot that it was infact patented by your lab only who themselves said they were in my condition as well(all laugh) but then even more strangely after getting back to your senses(all laugh) you aksed me do you understand the difference between the feeling of a limb and feeling of a limb ache at the same time at use(all burst into laughter) no one of them was asking me for a medicine for headache(all burst into laughter) i said this(all brust into laughter) they wisely told me not sound at all the question should’ve been at the certain stage of the ache when the limb says my ache turn against the limb do you understand then you’re turning against yourself only unless you don’t have the emotions(all burst into laughter) you see lad,your schooling hasn’t been good at all so you fail this thus restart the classes don’t bunk agian(all uncontrollbaly laugh) then my Abomasnow later said this urge to know the emotions is the root of despondency of the self action of the ache master brat mind this with the difference between self ache and ache self during supplimentary exams(all unoncontrollbaly laugh,tears) hence asking if you agree that they mean the self ache must be turned on itself hence why virtual emotions of ache self where the actual emotions are not(all burst into laughter) i remember these lines as well cause what they meant to me then and what they actually are(all laugh) not these lines though(all burst into laughter) these i realized during the journey itself that while we were at a dense snowny extremely high mountain at dusk with severe snowfall(all laugh) you were at a philosophical round table conference with coffee and snacks(all burst into laughter) then Bonnie had Chanedlure’s ball with her(all laugh) whom she released but was taught for many hours on the idea of pure idea of the idea of pure snow from the point of view of impure fire with half fired semi ghost(all burst into laughter) hence the rest semi is snow(all burst into laughter) and Clemont had Infernape’s ball who was released and told him this idea of sanity is the root of this snowfall as the water see the despondency has turned the subject to freeze(all burst into laughter) he still says that itself made him realize these sort of pokemons and a master isn’t found anywhere at all as Reshiram says(all laugh) this experience i remember so much cause i realized which world you were living hence..(all laugh)..’,’how Misty ‘mam connects with me(all burst into laughter)’,’um..no that i realize you calm down when she is around(all laugh) but only for her(all laugh) and according to everything hence she’s your soulmate(all laugh)’,’right but she is taken or now herself goes there as well(all burst into laughter)..anyway(all burst into laughter),so i said,’what does Mr Shane say about soulmates(all laugh)’,’yeah similar stuff but Kalos language isn’t polished(all burst into laughter)’,’the emotions matter only(all laugh) surely being long time friends no trial of trial was involved(all laugh)’,’um..no too formal and me too intrigued since i stepped foot at Unova(all laugh)’,’suddenly treading on the treasure bullseye that is then(all laugh)’,’yeah pretty much(all laugh)’,’thus the psychophysicality is mitigated hence this happiness(all laugh)’,’yeah like that(all laugh) but still even that Mamoswine was ok but Heatran at mount Raiforstierglobs(all burst into laughter)..the most dangerous volcano with ice peaks exactly why even pokemons are are afraid of Heatrans cause they live right inside it(all laugh) and there alone with 2 day tamed(all laugh)..’,’yeah needed to know their ideas of existential being(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah i guess(all burst into laughter) but there you didn’t take any of us fortuanetly(all laugh) and you returned somehow used all sorts of illegal medicines(all laugh) cause you were there for 3 hours(all laugh) at night(all laugh) so after returning to senses you said such family bonds are roots of people who doesn’t need inspiration ever like some people i know(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs,Tracey shakes his head laughing) then with these we all knew this will surely be a journey to remember beyond lives(all laugh) and it has been(all laugh)’,’yeah but going to Huntelion is better i guess to meet Kommo-Os from close quarters to understand the situational demands time to time of the self that is(al burst into laughter)’,’yeah but better if beforehand it can be known(all laugh)’,’yeah surely Doctor Brock Slate hasn’t ever been to huntelion you see(all laugh,Brock shakes his head laughing)’,’yeah,i understand but is he the man..’,’no not him Doctor Slate has been rather mostly inspired by his own family(all laugh) whole family is like that it’s a heredity(all laugh) and yeah he has been inspired by various people like we all do but his own ideas and feelings that he extracts from the inspiration by far surpasses the inspirator many of whom are pokemons his own or wild or other bunchs like Mantine and else(all burst into laughter) so he surpasses his inspirator by his own generalization of the feelings than that person himself or herself you see(all laugh) but the man is Dr Tracey Foxly SktechedIt(all burst into laughter,cheers for Dr Jackal and Mr Fox,all burst into laughter even more,Tracey shakes his head laughing) he doesn’t need any inspiration since he’s born to be honest(all laugh) as Kyurem says before being born he knew about it(all burst into laughter) cause he is perfect as a gentleman fox that is(all laugh) such people are found as frequently as my Guzzlord(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah,i understand why you bunch is so apt at irritating people(all burst into laughter) and..(all laugh)’,’yeah,Dr Gary Oak needs inspiration and did so as well when he was Mr Gary Oak(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing) that is just like i myself do hence Doctor Slate is there for us who only confirms from Dr Skechit so you see the spring fountain(all burst into lughter,cheers for Fountain of Second Cousin Masks,all uncontrollbaly laugh,Daisy in tears and fits of laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “you brat i warn you Daisy’s husband is not a selling product(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “not that type of years(all burst into laughter) then i continued that yeah Dr Gary Oak is just one month older to me,who after being born rectified the doctors saying,’professionality,this is Mr Oak’(all burst into laughter,Lillie uncontrollbaly laughs in tears of laughter hugging Gary,Gary shakes his head laughing) so personally ever my twin bro(all burst into laughter)..”
Gary(laugh) : “yeah my good luck(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “Mr Oak now you’re born now Mr Oak why is it called born(all brust into laughter);anyway(laugh,all laugh),then i said,and we were brought up together and he is just the non philosophical version of me if he was there at Mamoswine he would’ve given the answer in for of the question that the ache should be typed first to have a better realization of that type(all burst into laughter) so yeah you surely now understand why my bunch acts as they do(all laugh)’,’um..yeah,hence whole world wants all of you(all laugh) but then again they and..’,’senor,people who were steady with Mamoswine herd and Malamar gang are good enough to take right decisions at the moment of crisis and not all has seen a Kommo-O from 6 inch distance unprotected and came back to tell the story(all laugh) so don’t bother about the profession at all and that 1 year was directed at right people only Kalos made it one year in palce of 1 day at most(all laugh) but Kalos has nothing to do with you as you now understand so just don’t bother and enjoy the right Kalos as described by Mamoswines(all burst into laughter)’,’um..yeah thanks but also your other travel companions..’,’fine then,May you’ve heard of and  Drew wasn’t my travel companion but he met May on travel first region of both of their’s Hoenn and thus i know him as well as a travel companion and yeah he also is like my own bro so i’m related to both infact in a way(all laugh),Doctor Brock Slate was the first ever gym leader who faced me i was lucky to get a badge as you know the story and you heard him and he is at Oak Labs as well famous doctor here at Kanto and was a former gym leader at Pewter City rock gym,Kanto you must remember that my first gym(all laugh) and he’s a qualified breeder as well he travelled with me in Kanto,Johto,Hoenn,Kanto Frontier and Sinnoh for 11 years and is an unique man indeed as i said and you saw and this is just the beginning introduction as well(all laugh) and then Dr Tracey Skechit was a travel companion of mine in Orange and i’m sure you know what his position is and i just told you who he is in reality of jackaling fox(all laugh),Dr Gary Oak is great too as you know already and i also told you about Dr Gary Oak(all laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing) and as you know i never saw my dad he decided to appear to me through mom as well and then i was kinda brought up at the Oak Lab and Gary has been like my twin brother only a month older to me like Tyranitar(all laugh) and why i repeat this is cause all the three have that same realtion to me as friend and brother and so on it’s most close siblings yet cause they are not own flesh and blood and we know each other inside out for decades(all laugh) i just am so happy to have a family like this and this also includes all the waterflower sisters as well as you realize(all laugh) and you know Gary’s position as well then there is Ms Dawn Berlitz one time grand conference winner at Kanto of all places(all laugh) and Mrs Iris Arrisu Garcia,Hoenn league champ and Mr Cilan Green,dragon specialist breeder at Unova his talks you too can get to hear and you can search his name up everyone knows him in the professional circuit throughout Orange,Kalos and Unova and so on and May’s and my little bro Max Maple is a general breeder at Hoenn at A level and despite Malamars and Mamoswines your trouble is that where do you stand(all laugh)..’,’um..no i mean but then the Waterflower sisters(all laugh)..’,’yeah surely i guess by now you know them well and how unique they are and yeah Mrs Daisy Waterflower Skechit,Mrs Violet Waterflower Slate and Mrs Lillie Waterflower Oak are my sister in laws and you understand the rest(all laugh)’,’yeah i do understand but..(all laugh)’,’senor i was instructed by Professor Oak to visit your parents cause they were at their position and all thus i did they were very nice to me and then i invited you cause you wanted to travel and you now realize who i was then and it was only for your benefit and now you are understanding that benefit and no matter what you thought during any point of time since then to the end of that journey you surely knew the impossibly hectic schedule and still never complained atleast and so it’s alright and your credit as well for going through that first and that second and Unova third finally Kommo-O that is(all laugh) and Clemont you’re seeing since day one stuck with me despite his goals being not exactly helped by my own professional knowledge yet he thinks he has been benefitted enough so tells the whole world about it and all now don’t believe that i didn’t learn anything from you or him cause he is a great man and will get to biggest possible position his whole personality is very sweet and endearing UNLIKE Kalos(all laugh) and you know Clemont is a certified engineer from Barkstrog University the best there at whole Kalos in his stream,a brilliant academic career and his jobs you know where he worked absolute top most level in his profession he is and more than deserved as we all know and he can earn ocean of money each month as you know but yet gave up the most lucarative jobs and just that interest of his made him follow me like that his knowledge is way above me cause i left school at 15 and failed in 2 papers at final(all laugh) my Pikachu saved my supplimentaries(all laugh) and thus i surely was extremely benefitted by Clemont cause my bunch needed his help and you know what i’m talking about and about you as well your business accumen is great(all laugh) it helped me in understanding many things that Elite4 journey has seen in public dealings(all laugh) you are as good a person minus that frivolity and illusion(all laugh) i surely at 32 would know what your attitude was actually and what your illusion was actually as you know i went there just after being released from under the cover(all laugh) so you were taken as a travel companion and was allowed to continue only cause i realized that you barring the illusion is exactly what Kommo-O showed you to be(all burst into laughter) and exactly what Mamoswine and Malamar agreed and opined you to be(all laugh) surely you’re not unhappy meeting a Kommo-O face to face are you as surely that has infact made you braver and stronger and most established in yourself i would say’,’um..yeah thanks but i just wished Spinda wasn’t that much hurt(all laugh) really Mr Rowan,my opponent there said that even judges were worried of their well being(all laugh) and he was compelled to use him to return to his family alive(all laugh) and still he infact felt sympathetic to my Spinda thus the tailwhip was most gentle as it was just a spontaneous physical reaction(all burst into laughter) but that’s obviously according to their scale(all laugh) which you know very well(all burst into laughter) so yeah seeing that really has made me realize that life is hard(all laugh)’,’but(all laugh)’,’yeah but still most enjoyable and fun if followed according to the Huntelion dictum(all burst into laughter) yeah..’,’exactly that is why Kommo-O is most revered like Spiritomb(all burst into laughter) and Claydol(all burst into laughter) and all else(all laugh) but as you see now you got rid of that illusive mess and now yourself see the result and so on so no it never was a one way traffic but you that day if had the modesty to not do what you did but before that day politely asked me of my ideas of thoughts on thoughts which i don’t consider as thoughts(all laugh) cause they make no sense as i told you by means of anatomy(all laugh) you would’ve needed 2 hours and dragged it to 1 year and then finally as i’ve ever said pokemons teach us the best and i’m first hand proof and example as you know best from first hand experience surely now what i was doing with my 2 day old Heatran inside a volcano(all laugh) and thus you got Professor Kommo-O(all laugh) nice guy though a bit emotional(all burst into laughter) so why are you hesitating to talk about the thought on your thoughts and so on(all laugh)’,’um..thanks no(all laugh) i thought i’m out of profession totally just a little link that i understand the systems there and a bit of knowledge and that list i read today Clemont said what those are(all laugh) but really i feel strange and akward that i was there amongst them well i only knew about Dr Gary Oak as Mrs Lillie wig(all laugh) and Mrs Blackmore with the shrewd vomit cleaner in built(all laugh) INFATUATED(all laugh) and now all the rest and it feels like..’,’what’s the name of your magazine and what’s your position there’,’SportsFanZone(all burst into laughter) and i’m at good position here but my target in the newses where i get comfortable in editing positions on pokemon and general govornment world interaction and so on the culture in and out of the world of both of these two and focused on Kalos cause i’ve seen 230 gyms hall of fame(all laugh) and 72 topmost competitions(all laugh) and now has some knowledge and so on so yeah that is ok but..’,’senor,that magazine is famous in even Kanto where people don’t care about Kalos and viseversa cause the standard is good and the writting too and if the fans aren’t there then government will have serious issues with wild pokemons running everywhere(all laugh) then they either kill them or cage them but you know they would do neither as the bottom line tells them others especially in Kalos(all laugh) to feed the money in fans are there ever and infact they take care of them by proxy via us and the magazine gives good views but Kanto gets the Kanto version not the original Sinnoh version(all laugh) and Kalos the same but you getting there is a huge thing cause the quality doesn’t drop at all and i recall your writtings on a few issues on this cross interaction and you didn’t know much about pokemons then but the not pokemon side was huge as was other things you were 5 years back too apt now after getting trained by Kommo-O surely way better as most clarified view(all laugh) so why are you shaky about yourself isn’t this the same thing that wasted your 6 years still you made it up in next 5 so Shane is right indeed forget ridiculus things of past that are dreams(all laugh)’,’um..yeah thanks much your laguage is something that people talk about(all laugh) cause it’s as strange as ever(all laugh) thus the experience is great so that was helpful for me but then..(all laugh)’,’yeah,you may contact Mrs Ketchum or me but you understand whole world wants me and i have family and extended family(all laugh) this barring my pokemon family who is first preferrence and requires 10 hours per day(all laugh) so you can understand the rest(all laugh) and she gym battles the rules you know and she has many contacts as well and so on so it’s hard to get much time today i’m in vacation but still my time is precious(all laugh)’,’no that is understandable but still i wish to have contacts with her(all laugh)’,’fine you can and don’t be shaky and go back to that again and again and so on and my views of you hasn’t been the best like that of Clemont and thus you’re not the one here of whom i spoke highly so mind that and no they are same as me and they understand the concerns of yours and so on and don’t be shaky cause you position and ambition is amusing and at your profession you’re at a good place so don’t bother about being shaky the rest you understand now just Kommo-O(all laugh)..’,’um..yeah thanks many thanks it made my years there(all laugh) really all such an idea(all laugh) ridiculus stuffs those and this is great yeah dream useless stuff(all laugh) so no i’m fine with it(all laugh)’,’you want to talk with my wife then TODAY(all laugh)..’,’um..yeah if that is..’,’it is the schedules of nexts will be upon her(all laugh)’..and now my flower will say the rest(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “whole world wants my hubby now and those who went off coming back now with Lugias(all laugh) so the girl spoke with me for around 20 minutes(all laugh) and you know i ever tell you extremely nice girl and i now realize what Mamoswines and Heatrans and Malamars did to her sanity(all laugh) and then the treatment then still poor kid had to face a Kommo-O which fortunately hasn’t decided to appear at my 15 years as a gym leader here in that form that is(all laugh) so i hope the next 28 goes like this as well(all laugh) anyway,had a nice chat 
on family WIDE isuues(all laugh) cause she asked me about the impact of Doctor Brock Slate in both our lives(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing)...cause except the name Doctor Brock Slate has been propelled to heaven everywhere he went as the reason to be HUMAN(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing)..as DUSKSHADOW(all burst into laughter)..and Ms Daisy Waterflower is the reason why he is still not toiling hard for his second badge and had she not existed he would’ve found no meaning in his profession cause she is the reason why this profession called gym leading exists(all burst into laughter,Daisy uncontrollably laughs)..WHIMSICROSSLEAFQUAILCONHOOPA(all laugh)..Dr Gary Oak has been praised as Mr Oak(all burst into laughter) and he has been depicted as why there’s a word called twin bro and lack of ego(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)..Mr Oak Mr Oak you’re happily laughing now/but now your signals a bit professional did you forget why you’re not a person then when and why and how(all burst into laughter)..GIRAGIUS(all laugh) then Ms Lillie Wig has been praised for the same(all laugh) who without one moment of hesitation jumps into fire to fondle a Margmorter(all burst into laughter) insinuating the meaning in between(all laugh)...DARKRAMAR(all laugh).. then it’s said exactly why Mrs Violet Waterflower went onto the performance and singing career was because her skills were too good for Elite4 to overcome thus first she shifted to only 1 on 1(all burst into laughter) then Elite4 pleaded her to show mercy(all laugh) so she went to different profession(all burst into laughter) cause Daisy was as good but more gentle(all laugh) cause Ms Violet Waterflower wants perfection from all look at her songs temporally(all burst into laughter)..AH!BOULDER!BOULDER!(all laugh) well Boulder as a whole has been made mythical as well as you know(all laugh) and Thunder and Marsh has next best positions as Brawn is the reason why the word hapiness exists(all burst into laughter) and Sabrina is a role model for the whole world to get inspiration from though even she says ghosts are not that innocent looking as most cunning(all laugh) and Pettelsberg is just family badge(all laugh) Cascade isn’t from anywhere describable(all burst into laughter) cause there are two Cascades(all laugh) the total blue one that he has is why the word gym and the leader exists but the current blue-red stripe version is why he is what he name suggests(all laugh) exactly that he wrote to Clemont describing me in the VEIL of abstraction(all laugh) and May is described as Ivana saw as the epitome of pure fire that is pure being as HUMAN(all laugh) and Drew is the reason why the word husband exists(all laugh) as shrew(all burst into laughter) really he has been tormented the most among anyone(all laugh) just imagine one going to propose his girlfriend and her bro says keep an extra jacket AGAIN AND AGAIN(all burst into laughter) no he later told me that your beau is an absolute meance to personal feelings(all laugh) to which my beau said just my Solgy(all burst into laughter) that brat entered my gym on Friday and told me how can i be happy with master brat as we both think we’re born(all burst into laughter) i told him do you understand that what you’re saying means all beings are in essence only ONE apprearing as different to the one who thinks he is the one as different from one thus to get back to the one he projects the one who has the same view of her one as him being the one thus both together are indeed one(all burst into laughter) that brat said yeah if one problem was there ok but won’t it mean that that eaxct one has the one which is the one due to the one that is the reason why you’re the one among many not not males whom master brat starves for the one reason for that is that you both are unhappy to be only one(all burst into laughter) i realized this pest if were HUMAN(all laugh) and could actually talk in the language we talk polisihing thier meaningless words to heaven according to my bee(all laugh) then he would’ve been an absolute meance to public sanity(all laugh) then the pest showed me a hallucination how with each bodyslam we become more dissapointed cause that exact feeling is why we don’t do it all time being bron the want to touch our spouses is the exact trouble of being born(all burst into laughter) then i was angry(all laugh) so i asked the brat do you understand what is death(all laugh) yeah girlfriend(all uncontrollably laugh) cause she has so many troubles as i understand that why she tries to be born but will see so much problems here mere kid just that age(all burst into laughter) then thankfully Solgaleo became Madgaleo and went to reservation to create a mayhem(all laugh) and i was just thinking of the time when Solgy jumped us and what he was then as a VEIL(all laugh) and this real form is better not spoken of(all laugh) anyway,these excludes a jackal(all laugh) cause the Jackal was given the highest honour of UNIVERSALITY(all laugh) the word fox is why the word family exists as(laugh) Tracey-looking-most-cunning-relatives(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing) so all were praised to heaven Melody was already despicted as such Dave and Zara has so far been relieved from becoming legendary(all laugh) but won’t be for long cause Dave is the reason why the profession called pokemon training exists(all burst into laughter) and he also epitomizes little bro,simplicity yet firmness,zeal and so on(all laugh) and Zara is the epitome of the word LAW(all burst into laughter) both say really he takes us as 5 year olds(all laugh) i said if that mood me too(all laugh) then Melody now is the reason why the sentiment that a sibling is a sibling no matter how cruel the behaviour is(all laugh) then John gets the tag of being perfect man(all laugh) Max also is similar to Dave and John was saying that well Drew is too known to bro as is Zara but me(all laugh) Melody said i heard infact the speciality of my bro is laughing everything off as we sadly know(all laugh) so why not this(all laugh) and you understand Melody’s nature from here(all laugh) and John said exactly why she was in that hell cause it takes 2 minutes for her to trust anyone if they satisfy her need of an abstruse chat on psychic types(all laugh) else the trust is called best friend(all laugh) and those so and so were psychologists and students(all laugh) and my bee was 16 when we first met her(all laugh) as was she(all laugh) so these were not present then(all laugh) but my bee in after match handshake of 1 minute(all laugh) and before final family isn’t allowed(all laugh) so there he congratulated then said 10 psychics in semis please forgive me Ms Sanders but your Alakazam used the fighting type disadvantage and foisted that on my Whimsicott as the curtain of responsible life(all burst into laughter) does he understand the difference between as-is and as-as(all burst into laughter) i mean as-is is what Alakazam did as life is appearing to him via you but Whimsicott’s life is as-as still doesn’t get the hold over the infinte logical chain so a bit moody in fun and games,kids(all burst into laughter) but this as-is intrigues me cause Alakazam is a master in as-as but that is also mixed with as-is as in his type and your communication and skills this idea of perfection as appearing to different genders as varied in certain aspects isn’t psychology a bit too specific in this as to forceing a particular method of thinking rather the universality but sepcificity on specific issues according to the changing age relations affecting beautiful thoughts of ethics of honesty of ethics(all laugh) but you handled both of these too well do you know sources from where i may come to learn about how to deal with comprehension as to in general we take the skill for granted as in intuition but this Alakazam made me realized that a few residues of charcter is still left in the tank thus the gas is diluted enough to serve a prolonged sorrow to the opponent as in terms of pokemon feelings(all burst into laughter) then John said with that question on psychological epistemology of both human and pokemon mixed perspective and so on at the age of 21 to a pokemon trainer after she won a semi final as a congratulatory note depicting that she was being trained by her Alakazam rather(all laugh) is something that made Melody understand that my bee is too sweet(all laugh) and then the succeeding 12/13 years of full professionality(all laugh) and these were the reason why none got what he wanted ever yet knew his words make them thoughtfully happy(all laugh) thank God i am not a HUMAN(all laugh) and that greeting he says was exactly to tell me this(all burst into laughter) and yeah the words of adoration like sweetie,honey,dear etc were learnt from for a change the jackal(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter,Daisy in fits and convulsions of laughter and in tears laughing,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..and Mr Oak Mr Oak wasn’t asked these cause soulmate is a textbook term these are not(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) so that is gross and these are non-textbook subtle emotional words requrining persistent non attached observation of the same but always possible only personally(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter,Lillie uncontrollably laughs in fits and convulsions of laughter and tears,Gary shakes his head laughing,Daisy also uncontrollbaly laughs in tears and fits of laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..and the crook wasn’t asked cause he doesn’t understand the amount of emotion that is to be carried according to the feelings cause he understands the feelings and can differentiate them before they arise(all burst into laughter,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs) but ONLY IF they are NOT presented verbally(all uncontrollably laugh,tears and fits of laughter,Violet in fits of laughter and tears,Brock shakes his head laughing)thus he also can’t verbally depict them conveying the right amount of feelings via right words to Viol within specific time(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter,Violet in fits and convulsions of laughter and tears,Brock shakes his head laughing)..”
Brock(laugh) : “yeah hence the word is Boulder(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,Ash says,”AH!FAMILY IS BOULDER!”,all laugh even more)...”
Violet(laugh) : “Doctor Slate,Doctor Slate how much feeling is conveyed by the word ‘privately’(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “Mr Oak Mr Oak being a textbook term isn’t this impersonally observed “attitude?” (all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter)...”
Gary(laugh) : “you brat i’ll terminate your bunch including Magmortgolem(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “is brat a dictionary term(all burst into laughter)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “and the jackal was asked Tracey sweetie see it rhymes(all uncontrolably laugh,tears,fits of laughter,Daisy uncontrollbaly laughs in tears and fits and convulsions of laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “yeah i have had ovserve out that day as well(all burst into laughter)..actually Mr Oak Mr Oak was asked something most heinous just after he entrered the Gym entrace the outside part and went to that single batroom as usual(all uncontrollbaly laugh) so Mr Oak please..”
Gary(laugh) : “yeah,i didn’t mention it cause this pest had ashamed me(all laugh)..Ashey-boy after hunting 200 year Cloyter herds gets to reservation brushing aside Lil and Daisy(all laugh) but before that to check on them calls me(all laugh) as Ashey-marrying-Ketchduck(all laugh) well that has has happened now(all laugh) call comes when my field day has finished with Tyranitar(all burst into laughter) then Muk jumps me as usual and grandpa said Gary become more balanced in personality(all burst into laughter) then i receive(laugh),’um..hellow,Gary talking?(all laugh)’,’don’t waste my time marry your Ketchduck get off bye(all laugh)’,’wait wait Gary,i cherish you so much(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears)’ yeah don’t think that it’s those brats at all all along it’s only this master brat(all laugh) and that brat Zekrom has picked this most heinous line(all laugh) i thought this must be the existential transmigration(all burst into laughter) and(laugh) this brat was waiting for reply(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter) so i somehow say,’are you alive(all laugh)’,’yeah in washroom(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,convulsions and fits of laughter)’ i was paralyzed by then(all laugh) so he continues,’no i was just asking that what is difference of the emotions that appears to you in reaction to this as i said when i tell you i cherish you to when Lillie tells you(all uncontrollably laugh,tears)..’ i was angry by then to the utmost(all laugh),’you brat stop acting(all laugh) and don’t disturb me or..’,’Lillie(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter)..cause she says similar lines in a show to Daisy or Violet(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter)..but that i understand thus told you(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter) but you see that this difference in gender as it appears no matter what among best friends who doesn’t share the same gender(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) can it create a confusion as the emotions conveyed there will vary between a best friend and if they are as you said soulmates(all uncontrollbaly laugh)..’ i knew i was in-between transmigration(all laugh) so the brat continues(all burst into laughter),’are you my boyfriend(all unocontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter) or Lillie’s(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) so please i’m waiting for the replies of these 2 questions(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter)..i finally realized why that brat Muk acts like a brat(all laugh) asks us similar questions(all laugh) and then the brat was still waiting(all burst into laughter) so i say,’just ask these to your Gyarados and don’t retun alive(all laugh)’,’well it could be a joke no matter the transmitted emotions despite being proportionally not overbearing hence the confusion(all uncontrollably laugh,tears)’,..that is Marshadow of course(all laugh) who was kept outside the washroom with Celebi there(all burst into laughter)..then i was very angry so i said,’would you marry me(all burst into laughter)’,’absolutely(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) but the post order formalities will require honest negotiations(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter)’..yeah this line too so you see i keep telling you and Drew spews that this pest is the most sly fox(all laugh)..so i realized the condition of the heart(all laugh) so said,’yeah congrats for marrying your Gyaradosduck after 8 years once more beyond umpteenth(all laugh)’ then i cut off to select the next life(all burst into laughter)...man that day really made me understand why you can’t prove the existence of afterlife only grossly(all burst into laughter) but after he leaves this body to save HUMANITY(all laugh) i’ll be asked exactly that cause it’s textbook term(all burst into laughter)..but Trace had a far worse experience(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “well that is for sure this brat defamed me(all laugh),so this pest went to Hoenn and after that was too longing(all laugh) then as Misty was playing responsible Gyarados during reunion(all laugh) he at first was very much attracted but then after a couple of hours understood it was PHYSICAL APPEARENCE(all burst into laughter) and if i utter the word beauty to depict his feelings on Misty’s physical appearence and this word as well(all laugh) then he will swear my head off(all laugh) cause that he says so many times Mist+Psychophysicality = Misty the last letter thus gets added hence thunder-chair(all laugh) so then once he realized that now this idea has sneaked behind the hallucination of respect mask(all laugh) he absolutely loathed himself(all laugh) then apologized to Misty first then and there by shwoing her respect while calling her Misty(all burst into laughter) the responsible Gyarados thought her bee is finally attracted to her PHYSICAL appearence(all laugh) so to play him furthur(all laugh) the real Gyarados barely managed not to raise it’s hood(all burst into laughter) but then i got the full wrath of this brat as to why Misty is less dark(all uncontrollably laugh) so he calls next time,’Trace long talk looming of personal nature your speciaty(all laugh) get in privacy i’m with Crawdaunt and Sableye(all burst into laughter) that means no sane legend is coming anywhere near them even then as well(all laugh) then says,’are your skin conplexion less dark(all burst into laughter)’,’um..Ash what(all laugh)..’,’Trace don’t cross me(all laugh) do you look PHYSICALLY good or not(all laugh)’,’um..(all laugh)..’,’what is the ratio of the dark pigments against the lack of it in your body and that of Marshadow(all burst into laughter)’,’Ash,don’t get so frustrated if you’ve been just charmed by a very beautiful girl that’s not(all laugh)..’,’not a particular gym leader(all laugh) why is my Mist who’s my best friend(all laugh) using invisible cosmetics these days(all burst into laughter)..’,’Ash please you know best how beautiful..(all laugh)..’,’Trace don’t try me(all laugh) your answer is i’ve seen many girls but none are my Mist who is my best friend for exactly this reason(all laugh) now give me your answer if you are proud of your PHYSICAL appearence(all laugh)..’,’um..(all laugh)’,’do you feel happy if your Dase flower praises your PHYSICAL beauty(all burst into laughter)’,’um..(all laugh)..’..really i was not alive then(all laugh)..’Trace!you’re so sweetie my doll!(all uncontrollabaly laugh,tears,fits and convultions of laughter)’...yeah this brat said that exactly(all laugh) then only affirmed the beginning by namecalling twice(all burst into laughter) and the last part was removed cause it has a disdainful stench of PHYSICALITY(all burst into laughter)..i was dying in two lives later then waiting for third(all laugh),’are you listening(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter)..Trace you’re so sweet dear(all ucontrollbaly laugh,tears) no honey please don’t leave me here(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter)..’..i was 10 lives off the place(all laugh)..this pest then continues,’PERSONAL OBSERVATION(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) what does these words mean(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears)..’ i was still paralyzed(all laugh)..’WHAT DOES THESE MEAN DURING BREEDING SEASON OF HERACROSS(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) AND WHEN I TELL YOU THESE(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter)..’ i realized someone was proposing my this life’s dead body(all burst into laughter) i said,’man please i know you just said you consider everyone as a girl except Misty(all laugh)..well as i said the pest then and there said it and also before as i said Mrs Ketchum herself was scoffed off at this issue she’s my girl best friend cause she’s not a girl(all laugh) and by then all of we 3 knew it Gary since 0(all laugh)..so it’s alright if for once this thought has come to you it’s(all laugh)’..well it means i’m the most devillish vulture as he said inside his mind honestly hallucinating him to be dishonest(all laugh) so then only intuition but i cross the most dangerous line that he isn’t Misty’s soulmate(all laugh) the reverse is generally scoffed off only said in desperation at last hours of his first night being married to her OFFICIALLY(all laugh) cause we pressed him like that by confessing our longing to our playboy beau(all laugh) but as much Misty was incensed with other girls this pest being abstract wouldn’t be bothered at all about anything she does UNTILL someone shakes her hands(all laugh) including him(all burst into laughter) cause that’s no more abstract(all burst into laughter) and Mist+objectivity = Misty again the last letter added(all laugh) exactly why it was removed(all laugh) hence thunder-chair(all laugh) but on himself as he’s the subject here(all laugh) yeah i know as well that Luxray only does what this brat does(all laugh) so i now will be facing psychothrombonosis(all laugh) says,’skin skin skin(all laugh) pigments isn’t it Trace(all laugh) flesh and blood just a cover used for products like tan and then you know rest(all laugh) product product product isn’t it Trace you are none but a product?(all laugh)..now i never heard him this serious ever(all laugh) so i try to calm him down sadly(all laugh),’Ash please don’t get so agitated i know how truely you cherish Misty..(all laugh)..’,’as best friend(all burst into laughter) right but i don’t have my answer yet(all burst into laughter)..’ so i said,’yeah these you say to your wife but only to your wife(all laugh)’..this is cause any other word except wife will mean he will send Sableye back for a vacation to join Banette and Marshadow(all laugh) then this is only the beginning(all laugh),’is Daisy your wife or Marill(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears)’ and exactly why you understand i say this that those two means of peace Conhoopa are teaching these two my daughters since age 0(all laugh) while i’m fed this bribe to trap their mom(all laugh) COUNTERING(all burst into laughter) so i confessed(all burst into laughter),’man please only very close friends who has no such idea or are married or in a relation with other people can say this as a joke else only among couples or siblings or spouses or relations like that in case of cross gender domain(all burst into laughter)’..’so you can say these to your Dase flower then as she does incognito to Violet(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears)’,i was born again then in 20th life(all laugh) i say,’well if we ever get in that sort of situation as i told you then(all laugh)’..’congrats to you two Mr and Mrs Skechit best wishes for your future journey together.bye(all laugh)..’..and i was retransplanted to this life thankfully(all laugh)..all his pests are doing only what he taught them minutely hidden in his Mist too happily(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well eloquence takes years and ages and lives to get into existence only then the rest is polishing it(all laugh) never ending perfection(all laugh)...anyway(all burst into laughter)..”
Misty(laugh) : “of cherishing my sweet cute idiot hubby Ash(all laugh)...so(laugh,all laugh),still before going back to his antics at Leveder the crook was asked the most dreadful question just after my bee won against Saul’s den(all laugh)..but before that i was asked(all burst into laughter)..well actually i was resposible then cause Gyarados wasn’t(all laugh) and during reunion i realized my hubby is finally too much longing(all laugh) then i come back and obviously the less darkness is a huge issue then(all laugh) age related yeah(all laugh) thank god that brat wasn’t there then(all laugh) but will be with Gili(all laugh) and so i return and because my bee has only one personal female friend because she has been never told him that she is a girl(all laugh) and hence was spared and mostly cause she was out of profession and served the everday need of emotional management and psychological questions(all laugh) and then i return i was asked for certain personal advices like helath and etc and ever cautioned me to be aware of the ulterior(all laugh) i knew too overprotecting(all laugh) but he wants the 16 year old Viridian Lake version cause that’s the real me(all laugh) with ponytail as well(all laugh) hence the wisdom mask was most loathed(all laugh) and then for the first time once said you look pretty today(all laugh) i giggled and thought finally my bee is trapped(all laugh) then to my utmost bewilderment says,Mist does it make you happy if i say you’re pretty(all burst into laughter) i was in-between lives as well(all laugh) so he continues,no you know one thing is to say that you look cute today another is this word as cause it’s about the gender(all burst into laughter) and the trouble with your gender is that they can become proud of this issue(all burst into laughter) hence the polishing(all laugh) and in my gender’s case the reverse(all burst into laughter) this appearing difference is the basis of all evils as it disturbes your Gyarados in her dragon rage is this psychophicality in you as appearing as pride make her understand that this means the the dragon rage while during attack should be varied as less more less less(all burst into laughter) and in say in case of Feraligator(all burst into laughter) the counter by rotating quickly to confuse by self confusion(all burst into laughter) he will try to think that this means to do less-more-more-less thus to thus getting Gyarados to trap at third visit(all burst into laughter) exactly why this is a trouble cause that’s what you’re expecting i guess(all burst into laughter) i understood my sweet bee was proposing me only by apolozing that he once thought i looked good PHYSICALLY(all laugh) so i said it’s ok we’re best friends(all laugh) i won’t use cosmetics at 23:30(all laugh)...but Brock how were the pictures preserved and then your most difficult day of being grilled(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “pictures were kept like 5 year old kids infact(all laugh) only the first one was preserved for a few days to see what happens to the ink in decay(all burst into laughter) then ever said,too sweet my wife little kid just this blooming youth(all burst into laughter)..THIS IS THE MASTER PEST BY ALL MEANS(all laugh)..and the grilling was my darkest day really(all laugh) but Spew disagreed again with revulsion(all laugh) this brat asks,’Brock please don’t mind but during traditions if it feels that this is wrong step how to retract(all burst into laughter)’ i was very suspicious(all laugh) then before i could do anything says,’no not what you’re thinking(all burst into laughter) my Mist is my wife since the day i first called her Mist MENTALLY(all burst into laughter) that’s about after we started for Viridian leaving Cerulian gym on the way where my Mist ate a few spicey food and vomitted(all burst into laughter) and then later straight came up to me without any thoughts and i took care of her as much as i could that was at night YOU BRAT ORDERED THOSE AND WAS NAIVELY SLEEPING(all burst into laughter) she somehow called me and other problems were there too and then was just like a kid and looked at me whom she knew for 2/3 weeks as if i was her most dear one and i knew she was my wife and me her husband for life(all laugh) AND YOU BRAT WITH A NAIVE FACE TORTURED MY WIFE(all laugh) i thought yeah,the food was ordered by the Gyarados at my expense and then my share was eaten up by her too so i starved at night and she ate too much but i only starved else would’ve had to do so without ears(all laugh) and this pest whole time was only observing her with extreme care(all laugh) saying just don’t go overboard which sent the Gyarados to overboard of course(all laugh) and then he says,and this was after i said what are medicines cause i caught a bit of cold she was exactly like my mom then herself being so little then did what she could hence the LOGIC(all laugh) but no Mist is my dear wife forever but metaphysicality is the essence of marriage isn’t it Brock in terms of that feeling(all burst into laughter)’..i realized i was talking with aliens(all laugh) i said,’um..Ash if you have any confusions(all laugh)..’,’8 years were spent to erase that word confusion Brock she did in 8 seconds(all laugh) but this current confusion is on relationship break-ups Brock why does it exist(all burst into laughter) despite the feelings being perfectly right at the beginning(all laugh) what is the meaning of the words wife for life and forever in feelings Brock confirm(all burst into laughter)’..i understood unless i confirm my pokemons will be asked(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears)..i said look situations can arise but an honest talk now we know to add in ethical honesty of moral ethics in honesty in ethical honesty(all laugh) so those can clear thing out if the two persons concerned are true to each other..’,’hence break up(all burst into laughter)..i see proffesional and/or personal issues interacting as a dual type very thickening subject indeed(all burst into laughter)..and those two brats Magmortgolem say these exact words so you see this is the master brat by all means ABSOLUTE(all laugh)..then i say,’Ash please you’re just very dissapointed that she is not with you now why don’t you call her(all laugh)’,’well i was in traditional ideas you see(all laugh)..thrice(all burst into laughter) but didn’t feel like there’s any word or this idea of break-up existed it is objective this subject of break-up that is metaphysically like a mirage(all burst into laughter)’...i didn’t know what to do(all laugh) so this pest asked the most dreadful question then..’sorry to ask personal questions Brock but you’re my big bro you know..i thought yeah my bad luck(all laugh)..can you give me the generalized discourse on the different feelings during traditions across age and that yearing(all unctontrollbaly laugh,tears)’..i was dead then(all laugh)...then this pest says,’during traditions the overbearing feelings of psychophicality Brock isn’t that the reason of break-ups as feelings(all uncontrollbaly laugh)..what is that mid point Brock when things are settled during the mid point exact when the real emotions are more vivid of loneliness despite not so(all uncontrollbaly laugh)’..i was thrown to hell then(all laugh)..so this brat was in Noivern mood of age related thoughts(all laugh) then asks the even more heinous questions..’why does it feel what does it feel during traditions Brock(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) given the yearning in categories in psychophysical scales as interacting with the abstraction giving this understanding of illusory different appearences of gender(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears)..i was in traditions with my wife Brock i was happy so was she why Brock(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter)...i knew this is the feeling after death(all laugh)..i didn’t know my gender neither did that of her why Brock answer me(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) the idea and realization that the another of another gender is my spouse forever with whom i’ll be forever against the break-ups throw some light Brock on the idea of a proper marriage not in words but tell me what is it exactly that makes it lifelong give me Brock that FEELING(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter)..’..and he was then waiting patiently for the answer(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears)..i somehow managed to say i’ve an urgent call to make just call your wife as soon as you can and ask these(all laugh)..then tried to flee the scene now the most cunning fox comes out..’call Violet i guess for confirmation of the shared experience(all burst into laughter)..tell me Brock why are you not marrying her officially(all laugh)’...now i realize this brat is insinuating according to his Palkian standards(all laugh) i said man please we’re not at that stage yet(all laugh) which means(all burst into laughter)..yeah this pest even insinuated that out(all laugh) we must stick around to know about ourselves and the other more only then any possibilites may come and you and Misty have been married for 8 years since day one you might’ve been late but she took one day to devour you up absolute blindly(all laugh) surely she cherishes you by the truest means as much as i got it for 4 years then and 4 around that(all laugh) and you know best what she is and i also know you’re as much devoted to her and blind in your yearning for her since the first day itself took time just and these 8 years are enough but keep in touch else both will pass a singular life(all laugh)’..i see Brock you mean spouses have least idea of psychophysicality about the other thus the prolonging of the longing GENLTLY(all burst into laughter),thanks Brock these questions will be asked tomorrow the first thing to Feraligator(all burst into laughter) cause he doesn’t concentrate on differentiating between the surface and the lesser level feelings or that longing for philosophy of being(all burst into laughter) hence he is jovial but unstable(all burst into laughter) he needs to plan his life by abstrating the plan that being is self to self dancing to the tunes of self but not clear yet so confusing but that’s the plan of dancing rightly knowing the undercurrent to manipulate every other currents being happy and to be happier by the actions and jovially free(all burst into laughter),this idea of dancing to that self tune Brock all ALONE but all in that word LONE as A suggests that play the observing ME(all burst into laughter),being happy all by self in self when i’m a Feraligator and viseversa(all burst into laughter),thanks Brock ‘night(all laugh)...i realized this pest is trying to teach his own ideas of philosophy the most abstruse parts of it to a brat like Feraligator and expects him to enlighten him in return by double(all burst into laughter) so this kind of a pest will not be seen in my lifetime again atleast(all laugh) so i toiled hard in the journey(all laugh) and Feraligator for 1.5 years and then Crawdaunt for 1 were asked these each day 10 times(all laugh) with all else(all laugh) and you understand that this brat indeed has spoiled each of his brats minutely(all laugh)...”
Misty(laugh) : “well my bee is too desperate to make me a Gengar(all laugh)...hence those pictures even then(all laugh)..to which i was counselled as,Mist sweetie don’t use those stuffs cause when you use cosmetics to the skin of your lips(all burst into laughter) yeah two are different(all laugh) then it goes inside your stomach eventually bit by bit(all burst into laughter)..then i played the sentimental card(all laugh) i said Ash don’t you like(all laugh)..’Ah!Mist i wish you were with me(all laugh) we stay so far away(all laugh)’ this is reverse sentimental card(all laugh) then i still tried saying,yeah sweetie we cherish each other so much but still just pictures and calls(all laugh)..now my bee i obviously ever knew was too extremely cunningly caring(all laugh)..really he used to tell me well first the crushes(all laugh) that too day after 1st proposal(all laugh) then that day itself told blood and sweat and so on and why i wasn’t HUMAN(all laugh) but atleast wasn’t eloquent then later after 2nd desperately tried to teach me and still does(all laugh) and then still he told me what he thinks in reality about all sorts of stuffs and they were as strange as his methods are and you know too enjoyable(all laugh) but before this eloquence was much sane language(all laugh) and dense of course(all laugh) now it’s very difficult for me to go off the path cause even if i want to fondle him says um..at Viridian i walked too fast you were behind i didn’t look behind Mist you were alone may be had some trouble(all laugh)..so it’s very hard now(all laugh) and what i do now as a 16 year old even back then i knew i can definitely be so with him even while wearing the mask(all laugh) and hence my troubles as well in part then(all laugh) and these too personal talks were during night video calls(all laugh) which were ever half an hour and these talks for maximum 20 minutes first then silence(all laugh) so i tried to play the card(laugh) that we have to stay apart despite the fact that we want to be beside each other so much so now he counters(all laugh) ‘Mist you’re so sweetie(all laugh) my sweet Mist flower ever in my being(all laugh)..then the difference didn’t go hence his troubles(all laugh)..i so much yearn to see you and hear you everyday but mostly just contemplate you each moment dear(all laugh) just like my bunch(all burst into laughter) but of course they are they i’m me and i want my Mist all time in my feelings(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) your sweetness isn’t expressed by any means just your presence my dear you’re so sweet(all laugh)..’..so this means pictures are secondary only(all laugh) and then i’m too sweetened to not moist the screen(all laugh) but what it means to Viol and Lil(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “Brock what do you know about water type post marriage philosophy(all burst into laughter) in that feeling(all burst into laughter)..”
Brock(laugh) : “really these two little brats has been after me for 21 years i should’ve killed that brat Chu that day(all burst into laughter)..yeah right in feelings(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “this is the easiest way to trap my lion cause he will get too easily philsophical hence imbalanced(all laugh)..”
Gary(laugh) : “no this brat has spoiled everyone and still the gentleman came out with flying colours having the cunning bonhomie(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “in that Daisyl(all laugh)..but finally why my bee is too happy now as you know is exactly what he told our sis and bro-in-law and they knew our little misfortune so that with Melody’s condition and everything was to be laughed off as Melody was so desperate for that(all laugh) so then my bee gets all these and says well i’ve ever comsidered that pokemons teach us a lot and we all agree,sadly though(all laugh) so lets go the the university of Seismirottzel(all burst into laughter) 
differences in appearence i face while i came  here/this boy this mind to that one that’s there/went forward towards that in opposition ever/cause the logic was i’m not what that is no never/while i went there found the thing as is/cause all the life it has ceases while i cease/thus the things appear here in differences to me/are only here being alive cause alive i want them to be/but if the difference ceases when i understand this thing/that outside of me there are things to which i fondly cling/are the call of me to myself to touch the reality/that is me was,is,will the sugar invisible in a cup tea/considering that the sugar there knows it’s role to the whole being/and that the tea only is sweet because to that it cling/thus all the essence in everything is seen as what i call my self honestly/is only here in my self if searched earnestly
(laugh,all laugh and cheer for Seismirottzel)
so this gives those three utmost vulgar brats immortality which to them is one of girlfriend’s substandard beaus cause you’re prolonging the longing by searching for happiness in distributing yourself to one way and not the other thus not fully dancing to the tunes of that chosen tickling(all burst into laughter) and Melody hugs my bee to death then and Johnny boy joins in(all laugh) but as you know my bee says this is the emotional core that is available to HUMAN understanding personally not grossly thus in feelings only observable though possible to describe with proper word emotion transmissional proportion in ethical balance of persistent starvation(all burst into laughter) so this is now to be laughed off so my hubby says a tribute to my bunch(all laugh)..this one my bee will do cause his sweetening quotes i can always do but these are impossible cause i don’t want to get jovial which my bee is desperate to make me(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “cause you like me(all laugh)..anyway(all laugh),so i then said as a tribute to my brats(all laugh)..

In your mind unknown
We walk not lone(all laugh)
thus We live to throw you out of this exact misery(all laugh)
We are ever young
In spoiling your daughters and sons (all burst into laughter)
As we live beyond mind to show you anatomy(all burst into laughter)
so of yourself be afraid(all laugh)
It's the plan we play
To show your last sane day has been yesterday(all laugh)
So hear our voice,
Now we have a CHOISE (all burst into laughter)
It's time to distribute it (all laugh)
We are one
Opposing that one
Must oppose this one(all burst into laughter)
Thus Countering ourselves we’ll plan together(all burst into laughter)
Cause You’re the one
Projected us as one(all laugh)
As the CHOSEN ONES(all burst into laughter,cheers for Chosen Brats,all laughs even more)
We are one
If you’re think you’re the one
We will pester you forever(all laugh)
Cause We are one
Thus appearing as none(all laugh)
Thus we don't tire(all laugh)
We are never old(all laugh)
Cause we’re in your souls(all laugh)
Thus we live to erase the word discriminatory(all laugh)
As our sacred scars
Show you the brats we are(all burst into laughter)
As we make yourself tickle your mind out as illusory(all burst into laughter)
So of yourself be afraid(all laugh)
It's the price you pay(all laugh)
To make the last serious day as yesterday(all laugh)
So hear our maddening voice(all laugh)
Your own illusion of being has become our choice(all laugh)
And it's time to redistribute it(all laugh)
now this One
then turn aginst that One(all laugh)
to be the One(all laugh)
Opposing which one opposite you will stand together(all burst into laughter)
Never number one
Cause that itself is aginst the one(all laugh)
Hence hearing your own maddening tune as a brat you’ll be the chosen one(all laugh)
Cause you are not one
As Not as the one(all laugh)
Thus we will pester ourselves forever(all laugh)
Cause we are one not not as the one(all laugh)
Thus we don't tire!(all laugh)

Misty(laugh) : “this blew the roofs off(all laugh) cause Deoxys was showing us hallucinations of how to turn against ownself in most vulgar way as these lines were going on(all laugh) those were something really..anyway,then lets return to senor(all laugh),so after all these(all laugh) normal talks began(all laugh) and she is well placed indeed too well and intellectually so(all laugh) and so on was shaky cause of the treatment(all laugh) she said yeah mistake never was polite to anyone in a way that will get the persons either to run off or to hug him but those hug him will get the comrade for life(all laugh) then finally she told me like Gengar(all laugh) just not possible to understand what they think cause they don’t know what it is(all laugh) so some experience that was then today Clemont talked you know after 2 years of marriage(all laugh) and was too happy said if you were there some fun it would’ve been cause my bee was at a self that we never know on hand and he told me each time they asked where are you going was the magazine(all laugh) and then the study materials,the subtle bodies the gym brats that misbehaved(all laugh) it’s a whole chapter Kalos that we will hear one day fetching Clemont here at Cerulian itself with his girlfriend Megan(all laugh) they know the show know everything in abstraction even the reunion(all laugh) and finally i tell everyone now today itself my bee said 1st day next year will be the 2 year impending ceremony(all laugh and cheers)..so yeah then will see all and those too will be hostaged up here(all laugh) and Clemont is way more free with me cause he knows the stories better and Ash is ever in contact he was kept hanging cause senor was disturbing(all laugh) and after he returned from Unova he sent him abstract emails describing his whole life without namecalls(all laugh) i was as usual praised to heaven to depict that Mist flower is indeed Ms Misty Waterflower turned Mrs Misty Waterflower Ketchum that is Mrs Misty Ketchum(all laugh) and i’m the reason why the words skill,grace,natural warmth,natural exuberence in all sections of life and finally holistic perfection as a human being as Gyarados(all laugh) these words exists BUT he and me are soulmates else there’s no reason for that word to exist if unused(all burst into laughter) then he confessed his longing for his wife(all laugh) by saying I’m his wife cause i’ve no gender(all uncontrollably laugh) the words are psychophysical ideas are the root of all evils of emotions(all burst into laughter) and because of the lack of the same we’re married(all laugh) so Clemont has realized that my bee is too Mistyfied(all laugh) and then we talked a bit and Clemont is excellent guy and much like Cilan but more frank being from Kalos(all laugh) but so nice you know his position and all has a girlfriend name Megan same profession same lab as well and too happy cause he said he absolutely realized later after that text he sent to him(all laugh) that what was bugging him then cause any girl was greeted as i see in profession so are you familiar with illegal swelling substances for Ultranercozma and its type and all(all laugh) he realized that Mr Ketchum was only ever bugged by only his toffee-flower(all laugh) and she wasn’t there thus the antics(all laugh) finally getting Kalos on hand witnesses is so great(all laugh) but before all my bee will say the impending plan and then a surprize to discuss today(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well i was thinking doing it on 2nd day next year as my flower’s birthday(all laugh) she says no first day(all laugh) hence the master brat inaugration day have to be brightened a bit(all laugh)..yeah well in Pallet and my brats aren’t allowed(all laugh) only Mime can come(all laugh) Chu may if he wants but he won’t as you know says starting to long,cunning(all burst into laughter) so he is perfectly spoiled to my relief really(all laugh) then Mime will be there later each person will be roasted including me and mostly my flower(all laugh) but as usual no person will utter the known words(all laugh) except count do you do in words..”

Danger lurks somewhere in the darkness(all laugh)
We are set for surprises - even battle!(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing)

We'll beat the psychochophysical darkness,

Time after time,

Giraoragius(all laugh)..so what’s the review(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “no really,this is special for sure(all laugh)..too happy..”
Gary(laugh) : “yeah,sentimental card to set more pestts upon me tomorrow(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “no they cherish you Gary,they cherish you so much(all laugh)..anyway,great trip to Levender for sure as well Mist Ketchum is so happy finally(all laugh) so great to see Eric and Junior great stuff Eric was so sweetly asking about Chu(all laugh) and all Mist had a great time there mood is nice now..”
Misty(laugh) : “my bee was doing stand up there whole time(all laugh) cause Deoxys and Chu was roaming around(all laugh) Chu said your weather should stay longer to get that idea of you so stronger(all laugh) Deoxys said yeah but still it’s the same isn’t it(all laugh) Melody so happy to see a Deoxys couldn’t manage one then and said Deoxys is just impossibly intelligent and all and we were treated with real hallucinations as well(all laugh) and the commentary of my bee with the hallucination showed what level he and his bunch is at(all laugh) he will say that later but Melody brought her Meowstic and Gengar(all laugh) my hubby fondled them too much(all laugh) and his fondling method is obviously asking questions(all laugh) cause that’s how he trained his own bunch after his 3rd badge(all laugh) and the fondling questions to Meowstic was sweetie(all laugh) your master told me to ask you the conjuction between sitting and playing while the two instructions are given with different attitude(all laugh) privately(all laugh) and honey(all laugh) also won’t you tell your master master that why you cherish her differently to yourself(all laugh) all of we three were in next life cause that question takes whole life to get the meanings out(all laugh) then my bee says first question establishes her belief that the master is in emotional equilibrium throughout(all laugh) and second question is to deepen the understanding of the first as she will fail in the second(all laugh) which did happen and the little kid came to Melody later with emotional attitude(all laugh) and fondled her too much not privately at all(all laugh) then Melody laughed and said what bait did you use that day(all burst into laughter) i said just that age(all burst into laughter) then he says the logic is ingrained in Meowstic dictum of life(all laugh) Meowstic life dictates that if a psychic movement by others is a food for emotional thoughts so one must be cautious of that as that draines energy and you get away to that reason of movement which is found to be the movement itself as the outside doesn’t appear in self introspection if calmness is achieved properly(all laugh) hence first question she realized the movements was all her and was happy that the master wasn’t the reason for her despondency and the second didn’t stop the movement no matter what thus she came to Melody(all laugh) it’s that FEELING(all laugh) and our brat hence waits for any movement anywhere to chew it down cause he has reached an agreement with himself listening to that maddenng tune(all laugh) and Palkia does that to get rid of the lie that things can be known unless one knows what is a thing and who knows to being with(all laugh) so i said these and Melody was laughing saying bro will be remembered for his vigil against treating pokemons as non philosophical(all laugh) cause all Palkia says is that he can’t understand why this attack isn’t stronger(all laugh) and Meowstic only says the during attacks don’t say things too quickly i get confused(all laugh) and only follows my sweet bee(all laugh) but it’s that FEELING(all laugh) and then Gengar(all laugh) Gengar was given two questions as well,’cute doll(all burst into laughter) please answer you master she wants to know the dark night dilution at strong subtle states(all burst into laughter) and won’t you tell her sweetie(all laugh) that you know the ideal gross existence of evolving stages of you agaisnt the semi neutral hallucinations at the moment of devolution(all burst into laughter) these send us two lives later(all laugh) that ghostly pest came as usual too happy to lick the hell out of us(all laugh) and the logic is first one tells Gengar dilution of emotions at strong subtle states means he is different to the master at those spheres menas he will either try to bulk up to save his master or get rid of this idea itself(all laugh) and try to throw his master off but can’t cause he at first agreed to the subtle state hence he knows his master likes him for no reason despite knowning what he will face(all laugh) and agreed to go anywhere with him to feel anything he feels so he won’t kill his master and if can’t answer either will not take you there at all means his anger too much or love too much any too much feelings to you is normalized hence he’s calms down(all laugh) and the second means the expansion of want of psychophysical urge against the subtle devolution that is looking back why exactly he evolved and pointing out the facts that he evolved for himself to go beyond all barriers self created and his master isn’t a part of it exactly at this moment he will try to get free of his master then will remember the first question and the fact that master must feel similar joy watching him evolve cause she must know all and only hence wants him to go beyond even Gengar phase and can’t join him but only physically but certainly mentally joined so this journey this thrist of perfection is shared and hence will return to fondle his master too much(all laugh) exactly what happened but sadly that pest showed us the feelings as well(all laugh) and then Melody laughs and says what does Gegarian life say(all laugh) my bee says,just exactly what my Gengar says,what is this Gengar is all of care/i can’t be Gengar by self tickling where i fare(all laugh) means he loaths any idea what so ever too happy always for no reason at all thus a reason gets him sad(all laugh) hence the word care(all laugh) and that care is master which must be merged as no reason to ultimately say master too is same(all laugh) or if not there then master will allow him anything cause he likes his attitude privately(all laugh) so then John says no wonder about your media image(all laugh) and he said,yeah man you see under the cover brats jumped at me to make me like this(all laugh) and my brats has fondled me like this since 9 years and even before but these last 9 years man it’s hectic(all laugh) but while those two were with us our two brats were inside(all laugh) and we went there in 1 hour and 10 minutes(all laugh) still less cause Charizard can’t be disturbed now(all laugh) Melody knows everything about everything on psychics as usual(all laugh) and no matter what ever had beaked off all her contacts like Sabrina and Giovanni and else(all laugh) so that half subtle body dragon travel was something(all laugh) she said one can travel but at 2.5 times less pace and at our pace with two of us just incredible(all laugh) i asked of the dangers said to my bee it’s same as plane travel of 30 minutes(all laugh) and only fear is if others attack us and that was taken care of to like 70% cause Rayquaza was at stupendus self(all laugh) and that brat got Dragonite very serious(all laugh) and you know what that means(all laugh) John himself is extremely good with psychics and all but Melody is too cunning(all laugh) just that sudden intuition is so amusing i saw and that’s why my bee for 11/12 years beaked her head off(all laugh) her bunch had been just very dissapointed cause they were so battle hardened(all laugh) now much better and John with his Unown and Reuniclas was learning the art of challenger lulling(all laugh) both has Golducks(all laugh) i took mine just outside released created a mayhem there(all laugh) and so on great time really those two are exactly May and Drew but Melody is way more frank and frivolus appearing and John is much more formal than Drew(all laugh) they were in tears hearing the vomit stories as that had to be brought up(all laugh) and then Levender means the 5 dates(all laugh) and all we were all very happy to be there and now with 9 nephews and nieces i’m too happy only(hugs Ash firmly smiling at him,Ash smiles at Misty and keeps tendering her,all smile)..”
Ash(laugh) : “standing on the air without the help of wings(all laugh)/fighting on the battles without the help of limbs/thinking of something without trying to think/thoughts and actions Mr Skechit day after tomorrow don’t be trying to link(all laugh)...how was the very first two weeks and how was tomorrow(all laugh)..”
Tracy(laugh) : “this brat will defame me Tomorrow(all laugh) last week Mr Oak Mr Oak was spared for his lioness(all laugh) well first week was crazy(all laugh) Nigel,Munro,Nancy,Persy,Samantha(all laugh) then the 4 greats(all laugh) first Cynthia was woken up(all laugh) then Wendy and then Ivana(all laugh) told us if ladies group is young very danegrous(all laugh) but if they are venerable professionals extremely dangerous(all laugh) and each questioned Ash for 30 minutes on air to give the whole world an idea on what he is upto(all laugh) then Ash said to poke the ladies group that they are not out of the world Mark was contacted(all laugh) then Mark on the other hand was shown that Ash cherishes Persy more(all laugh) then that was on rebuilding plans and then the next day(all laugh) first called Mcshin(all laugh) Mcshin is anyway incensed with the two gyms and 3 Cities cup going to Ash and gang(all laugh) and then of course there’s Pewter(all laugh) who must be specially but professionally treated(all laugh) and Brawn has become outlandishly jovial now(all laugh) and then still if Sabrina herself wasn’t mythical enough Safforn mustn’t be tempered with or the result is that the gym will legitimately and legally host a certain Gengar(all laugh) and Cerulian is not in the world anymore(all laugh) Wendy was incensed cause there are some of the more than most beautiful men(all laugh) Ivana was hurt in prestige(all laugh) and Cynthia was trying to wriggle away to sleep(all laugh) and then Mark was shown the door to Persy(all laugh) Mcshin was for 10 minutes only thus(all laugh) just gave an overview on how they are doing a few things and fled but Ash said see you soon(all laugh) Cerulian City Water Pokemon Gym,Kanto is specially marked in all authority bodies(all laugh) and Misty herself helped by getting her surname shortened(all laugh) so Dave was telling me that everyone knows that Mrs Misty Ketchum is is most pestigious being in the pokemon professional world(all laugh) and Cerulian city gym is her adobe(all laugh) same as Oak Labs and the directors(all laugh) specially must be treated and whole world also knows Pettelsburg Gym will contact only whom if such need arises(all laugh) plus there is Conferece Congress where Mrs May Maple Blackmore whole world knows is his sister(all laugh)  and to add to that there is her husband as well(all laugh) who can play with anyone unless he gets his ways(all laugh) so they are much protected as well and well Drew has shrewdly chosen Johto as well cause that’s the best place to be from all aspects for peace lovers(all laugh) so this was all that was done for the 5 Elite4 leaders but all this is the normal group and McShin is still rather has the professional respect and all Ash himself has that ever says 7 league is 7 league and then 6-1 and Lance had a real hard time against him at 6-4 but the last Elite4 against him is just Jasu(all laugh) so Jasu was summoned for one hour(all laugh) Ash please that i can’t do(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “no really Stu is Stu still no doubt about his career and all just too power hungry despite how good he is with his bunch but then i had lackies there(all laugh) and this time Dave was with me so call goes to his phone direct(all laugh),’Hellow Mr David Duncun how are you’,’Jasu(all burst into laughter)..’,’Mr Ketchum(all laugh) this is an office(all burst into laughter) you’re not holding one means others should is only your idea that all will not agree with(all laugh)’,’no Jason i do agree(all burst into laughter) but are you not happy enough with me that you can’t talk about say steel types(all laugh)..’,’Ash what bugs you about us’,’see you always say that i’m enjoying my time now that i can’t battle but i’m doing the conversations with professionals as i said i would and this is the first week and i’ve spoken with Nigel,Persy,Samantha,Munro and Nancy then all your colleagues at other Elite4 heads so why not you(all laugh)’,’yeah but i’m busy’,’so were they(all laugh)’,’i don’t have more than 10 minutes’,’Sinnoh was my 6th region(all burst into laughter)’,’then i can connect you to innumerable steel type gyms here in Sinnoh itself’,’Jason what is it that you’re busy with on Sunday(all laugh)’,’i’ve got an off day that i don’t have to battle and still come back and see the whole world’s problem being away from my family so atleast i’m reviewing my papers(all laugh)’,’then you have time(all laugh) Solgaleo vs Solgaleo 5th round 17 minute 3 challenger down 7-4 dusk maze up..(all laugh)..”,’why are you then not using anyone’s Solgaleo if you’re so interested(all laugh)’,’cause they don’t like me as much as you(all burst into laughter)’,’are you at the past still’,’future(all laugh)’,’well you know it takes as much effort to say that is ok it’s just your wish none would know or even if do it’s their trouble not yours and all know two opposing opinions can ever exist in that matter so physicians too isn’t a trouble and our mistake is compensated no never erased we told you that we made a mistake grave like that so that bit of dishonesty hardly a trouble if you agreed to’,’future means not mine but my bunch’s(all laugh)’,’well the basic tests as i heard unless their own lab(all laugh) they themselves are opposing now(all laugh)’,’they should as well if they can’,’surely so why don’t you play a monopoly now that you will own all pokemons and thus all will have pokemons but they will be trained by you and so on thus this profession itself won’t have any meaning and we all will find other things to do in life(all laugh)’,’well that doesn’t interest me cause if the profession is there may be we all will find something else to do but what happens to the pokemons(all laugh)’,’well you’ll remain and thus your own chosen ones(all laugh) and thus the govt will bear the fees for conservation(all laugh)’,’means again we have personal profession right(all burst into laughter)’,’why have you called(all laugh)’,’see i have 1000 people that are in my contact including you(all laugh) and then due to my career and bunch and all i’m in demand ever so i’ve decided to host a discussion session from my starter lab where a certain schedule will be maintained to get ideas from researchers,pokemon trainers in hall of fame,gym leaders and special type trainers or those who are experts in that say psychic types(laugh,all laugh) and breeders to have an all encompassing view for all to see and to share my and their knowledge and thus this being the first week many were called as i told you so why do you want to separate yourself from the world by abstaining(all laugh)’,’well if i didn’t abstain others would’ve given theirs and forced me to say yes but i realize it would’ve got us out of profession cause our own bunch would’ve been yours(all laugh)’,’i love pokemons Jason as much as you do(all laugh) but what is your problem in following Persy(all laugh) he doesn’t feel ashamed or feels i’m anyway superior(all laugh)’,’well neither did Trevor as you know best then sudden things happen(all laugh)’,’well yeah i agree with that and well Trevor still has contact with me and even my wife and it’s alright with him among us we just wish he was more prudent anyway,but you and i both atleast agree that all persons aren’t same take Lance and Simon for example or Nigel,Munro and Nancy(all laugh) and Persy(all laugh)’,’yeah well your problem in thinking that i’m hurt cause my bunch themselves went to you forsaking me(all laugh) is your idea only but my trouble is that intruding offices has become your hobby throwing your weight(all laugh)’,’well i’m doing so as to engage you in pokemon discussions only to relieve you from being thrown at the whole world’s problem so who’s intruding whom(all burst into laughter)’,’i see countering(all burst into laughter,.),why don’t you hold offices at Elite4 surely McShin will budge(all laugh)’,’or you(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah even you will get your gym shifted like the person whom you’re impersonating did(all laugh)’,’well all agrees that he deserves 2 hall of fame due to history(all laugh)’,’yeah and you triple(all laugh)’,’multiple right(all burst into laughter) 107 in numbers that is not me in one(all laugh) why is it Jason that pokemons don’t get the recognition but trainers(all laugh)’,’well then it will mean everyday tonnes of food and else will have to be supplied(all laugh) and if none battles then again it’s your men and your world(all laugh) yeah as it is now as you said(all laugh) so this means you win another another battle by trapping me in your psychic games from where only way out is to cut off the call and return(all laugh and .)’,’or to discuss pokemon like we all are trainers to begin with(all laugh)’,’i see giving lifelines(all laugh)’,’yeah as bunch has been given that they can’t be terminated unless my starter lab says so(all laugh)’,’that is they can’t be terminated at all even if they turn on the whole world despite you(all laugh)’,’to respite you yeah(all burst into laughter)’,’i see double edged(all laugh) i take the one in your favour(all laugh) that you’re after my job then(all laugh)’,’despite you(all burst into laughter)’,’so Solgaleo(laugh,all laugh) vs Solgaleo has to be directed by me review by you(all laugh)’,’to the international audience for hearing at anytime at their wish this is webcast and then uploaded through general Elite4 portal as well as Conference Congress portal for any registered member at our profession as a video with subtitles(all laugh) but all these if only the direction and review is reversed ordered(all laugh)’,’so you’re hellbent on creating a world of pokemon training and gym leading and even contests according to you(all laugh)’,’to my bunch whom all wants themselves including in Congress(all laugh)’,’and thus the discussion(all laugh) so how may i help(all laugh and .)’,’Solgaleo vs Solgaleo but can i before that judge your career(all laugh)’,’i see if i deserve my career or not(all laugh)’,’no to pay homage that i didn’t win Johto legaue that you did(all laugh)’,’so then how i lost to you(all laugh)’,’how the match was playfully to be played that you didn’t allow yourself to being responsible to your bunch rather than being playfull with them what they want(all burst into laughter)’,’so you’re desperate to make everyone like you cause you’re not getting any dance partners now(all laugh)’,’what’s the trouble there(all laugh)’,’that you will agree that you can’t do that cause all are not your bunch or even you make them to be(all laugh) the persons have different moods(all laugh) and propensities(all laugh)’,’thus my endeavour to serve the public(all burst into laughter)’,’i see so i’m trapped(all laugh)’,’the whole world wants the Elite4 leaders to show that they too are HUMAN(all burst into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing)’,’so well you made my day(all laugh) so lets talk about Solgaleo vs Solgaleo whole day(all laugh) yeah connect us to the audience(all laugh)’,’but please let me do the analysis first(all laugh)’,’fine but i’ve only a few minutes(all laugh)’,’till you reply again right(all laugh)’,’or you call(all burst into laughter)’,’or text yeah(all laugh)’,’fine then move on(all laugh)’,’see in your subconscious you’re just a like all of us playfull human being just searching joy and is joyous for it’s own sake(all laugh) so from that you chose this profession out of love for pokemons at the age of 16 years 1 month(all laugh) and entered Sinnoh league am i exciting you(all burst into laughter)’,’yeah for me to work overtime yeah(all laugh)’,’so that when you go back you’re tired enough to not speak about professional matters and just enjoy your time so i’m helping am not i(all burst into laughter)’,’i see family WIDE joy(all burst into laughter,Brock .ly laughs,Violet uncontrollbaly laughs)..the culmination of that FEELING(all laugh,Violet in tears laughing,Brock shakes his head laughing)..so you will have an alibie as well great plan and i’m both way trapped(all burst into laughter)’,’and happy(all burst into laughter)’...then Jasu of all people finally laughs(all laugh) says,’i see cunning(all laugh) so lets carry on’,’see just let me go on those papers can go to anyone to get it solved there’s innumerable people there and you’re there to just sign and read be happy man be happy we’re trainers not office bearers too many are there..the exact word applicable there as there here becomes Daisyl(all laugh,Daisy bursts into laughter,Tracey shakes his head laughing)..so Mr Jason Sinclair,Pokemon Master Hall of Fame,7 leagues,5-2,from Hearthome City,Sinnoh,Hall of Fame gym there ghost types(all laugh) i’ve visited Graham Sythom was leader then still is and among my 1000 contacts(all laugh) and that badge you have as well(all laugh),first region Sinnoh-win,2nd Sinnoh frontier-win,3rd Hoenn-win,4th Johto-win,5th Orange-win,6th Kanto-win,7th Kalos – win,8th Unova -not win(all laugh) cause you were in a relationship with your now wife and the feelings(all laugh)..then Jasu laughs again(all laugh)..who is a Hall of Famer in Contests(all laugh),Mrs Fantina Estom Sinclair,from Virbak City,Unova,hall of fame gym,Mr Tyson Talmar,in contact still leader,ground/steel gym,exactly why i selected Solgaleo(all burst into laughter)..then Jasu was laughing 3rd time finally(all laugh) and i visited that as well as did you of course(all laugh) for the badge then though(all laug)..Jasu was silently laughing(all laugh)..she started at 1st Orange-win,2nd Kanto -win,3rd Johto -win,4th Hoenn -win,5th Sinnoh -couldn’t win,6th Kalos -couldn’t win where you two met as travel companions like me and my wife did(all laugh) thus also i was saying at home you’ll be more happy after overtime or before if you are happy before(all burst into laughter) then Jasu was again silently laughing(all laugh) and then 7th Unova she won you didn’t her work was finished at Kalos you took a region more perfect symmetry(all burst into laughter) then Jasu laughs and says,’well this is intruding personal life as well(all laugh)’,’to make you happy(all laugh)’..so the brat was happy finally(all laugh) and then i said that,’so now that you’re happy may we connect to the international Audience for the leftover time of our hour to discuss  all possible situations in rather Dialga vs Dialga(all laugh)’ so the brat consents then we had a 25/30 minute talk there and all(all laugh)..and you saw why Jasu is in Hall of Fame(all laugh)..actually each of these three new imports McShin,Mark and Jasu are lunatic battlers(all laugh) and with Persy it’s now 4 Lances out of which two must be defeated(all laugh)..but neither Mark nor Jasu nor McShin will listen to anyone and get involved in everything hence getting more irritated which is the most in Jasu’s case who is thus so sweetie(all laugh)..so that was Jasu(all laugh) but that brat will come to pester us again cause i wasted his time his office will chide him(all laugh) exactly why my and Dave’s lackies are there(all burst into laughter) to play the brat again to calm him down(all laugh)..Jasu(all laugh)..what a brat(all laugh)..anyway,and yeah this call was recorded(all burst into laughter) so Dave gets to know this as well for entertainment(all laugh)...so Trace that’s Jasu for us then you continue..”
Tracey(laugh) : “ this brat in intruding everyone’s life(all laugh) and his wife is Gyaradosey enough to be totally blind(all laugh)..Misty don’t be so infatuated(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “unlike you(all laugh) my bee tenders me like a 5 year old(all laugh) and i can’t because if i do he will bring up the stories from Viridian where i smacked him but he hi-fived bit forcefully thus hurt my ring finger(all burst into laughter) and that means my fingues will be sweetened and shown that how these were hurt each time i touched him cause he was ulterior(all burst into laughter) psychophysical pain(all laugh) so can’t say anything and let him have his ways which is now today itself he used a glass to himself make me drink water sip by sip(all burst into laughter) while monitoring each sip it’s timespan frequency amount of water taken and so on(all burst into laughter) while patting my back so that each sip goes down without getting disgorged(all laugh) if i say one thing after or before it will mean he’s ulterior cause i’m less dark(all laugh) and now finally here few of my friends and all and yeah schoolmates(all laugh) few that are here and in touch again or was always total is 9+5 = 14 among which 6 are schoolmates one ever is Irene of course from Kane’s half(all laugh) then 2 from performance,4 professional but close enough(all laugh) cause from city(all laugh) and 1 is finances(all laugh) and the 5 fled all schoolmates of course(all laugh) Irie used to stay very balanced like Mr Oak Mr Oak has been Giraoragiused out of(all laugh) but she is just so naive(all laugh) and says yeah,Ash is too professional with all unless the mood is right(all laugh) i said just so naive(all laugh) then all they say Mist how sweet your hubby despite the name and all and his name and reputation is strange one(all laugh) like well it’s strange to say but it’s like Gengar(all laugh) i said yeah whole world says that(all laugh) cause himself propunded the name idea and the philosphy as well(all laugh) they have other contacts as well and never speak but Gengarian philosophy is doing the rounds everywhere as Saul is too fond himself(all laugh) yeah i asked Melody she said well this i know for 16 years anyway(all laugh) once asked her trying and trying not happening,happening/i know that can’t but is so i’m trying/the little pranks each time gets that but slips away cause i can’t/tried all finally gone now i am all without even a rant/sitting beside the flow gone all that are mine/coming around never again won’t shine/masking this in thoughts a Magearna may roam/that psychic is more cruel now fairy just as foam(all burst into laughter)..Meldoy do know this hallucination with respect to being an Unown(all burst into laughter) cause(all burst into laughter) steel the zeal in steel the idea/steel i’m all steel my criteria/purely i’m something and yet steel is there/can you see an Unown roaming in a mask of Magearna here(all burst into laughter),you may use this idea of intermixing of intuitive vigil towards the non-steeling of the matching the memory by steeling the learn happily to be more despondant hallucination for Unown(all burst into laughter)..this is just after he started frontier and Melody was in deep waters at Kalos and was talking about some attacks and all and my bee asked her a question and gave the reason for asking then the question itself was to be used as an idea in hallucinations and she asked how to perfect polymolar-cast maze and he said this is better cause that attack is overdependence on specification of momentary decision of neutral mind thus only a confusion(all burts into laughter)..and she said first scoffed my personal troubles saying just that age(all laugh) then this is asked as an answer(all laugh) and he just about started Frontier too happy after proposing you(all laugh) and this was on May just one month into the journey and i went in finals in September so just 3 months were left and i was in deep troubles and this comes up that too at his most joyous self(all laugh) i realized well atleast try to be my Unown and somehow managed till finals when at Round 4 Unown REVOLTED(all laugh) cause my bee had Shiftree then(all laugh) said Shiftree’s nature is just a bit hot tempered(all laugh) do you understand how to prolong that like an agitation(all laugh) so indeed my hubby is the real Shiftree as well(all laugh)..SHIFTREE(all laugh)..so Melody said i have recording of those questions(all laugh) as does Irie and all of our comrades here(all laugh) well everyone has infact Foster double recorded(All laugh) and Melody played a few another one is on Beeheeyemian life(all laugh) this is from Kalos infact and that too in his second year after 14/15 months or so and at around the time when Melody decided to quit the profession just in that 6 month period or just before that her Beeheeyem was in some sort of inconvenience and she asked about how to handle them after she quits cause they are very attached to her so feeling depressed(all laugh),see the idea of what is intrinsic to being as universally realized and hence the trouble rather than questiong why and what as in terms of analysing what is seen rather who sees must be analyzed cause a certain abstruse mathematical problem won’t invoke one bit of interest from and an a Beeheeyem the viseversa so the question is about thirst of this irritation with being(all laugh) being can’t exist alone thus who sees anything from the point of view of being only does so being something but if this being isn’t there then where is the fulcrum on which this idea of thirst will stand cause there isn’t this existential despondency of being why being is the root of all troubles is cause while being one thinks of being thus so being can never be alone and hence whatever it feeds on becomes being thus but that means again being thus so cause this being absobs the thus(all laugh) hence to get rid of this being it should be pointed out that this being that Beehyeem thinks as this or being is shared with his master then for both it should me a vigil till this idea goes that is why this being cause this being itself is thus so it’s the chain of despondency and being is is self sufficient only if it is realized that it absorbs everything and hence the trouble BUT absobing all and then still being one becomes omniscient and hence no need for being but to clear it’s path out is to get to the root of being is self itself which appears as being so the self is to be found what is self it’s not what is being thus everywhere if being is found it’s said in philosophical methods that find the being behind the being this idea of the ONE is the way out cause that’s the root of also your Beeheeyem(all burst into laughter) tell him to be happy cause of him,the life dictates that inside is a thing that is the real independent out out is what’s cling but outside is here so to do that thing,learn Beeheeyem to forget both to be the established in the real beyond your idea that’s the real Beeheeyem(all burst into laughter)..so my bee taught this most abstruse philosophy to Beeheeyem who says inside is all and outside none hence i forget how to connect the two means he is fooling around beyond the two cause he know they are not at all true(all laugh)..Melody said from start to end for 12 years same tone same language same abstraction(all laugh) and she said these were at one side and normal discussions,i used to listen to these all the time in confusion(all laugh) and there’s a huge volume of those recordings infact(all laugh),Sabrina of all people has recordings but later since Unova(all laugh),she said he asked me to differentiate the differences appearing at stages of Musharna and Hypno dose attack in terms how they view the mental inactive state from one to another then a decision comes up and during the process the emotions try to attack it the self isn’t found the memories fuel up confusions and experiences the knowledge thus in the end they assimilate the whole thing but again the force of assimilation itself forces them to use it,Sabrina how do they shut their minds up during mental inactivity(all burst into laughter) Sabrina said,i said just don’t let your brat sleep for 3 days and don’t return alive(all laugh) then Meldoy said these were going on in Unova as well but my bee at Sinnoh was very happy self and you all know so endearing to all(all laugh) then he did tell her to be cautious of pests and you still have 4 more to travel just go on,already 3 times champ even if you can’t continue you’ve done more than enough and so on very brief but good but then Melody said when my troubles started while he was at Unova that was madness(all laugh) and then played one from deep Unova on her first engagement day,this one is on TYRAniTAR(all laugh),’Hi Ash!..yeah by the way,Ash Ketchum never says Hi to anyone even to his flower ever always Hellow(all laugh) or Ms rarely if professional only(all laugh) else singles namecall or surname Irie ever,hellow Kane,it's his girfirend,oh sorry Mrs Halmsly(all laugh) and Susan always,yeah Susan(all laugh) now rather has become much more calm cause his brats are at stupendus self(all laugh) and infact Melody being Melody first saw my bee and hugged him to death then my bee patted her so unhappy said why am i not your sis(all laugh) so finally my bee had to hug her and then Melody infact later said never again am i telling him to hug me cause that was like she was just born(all laugh) and same thing May received in Hoenn itself she was too little so too impetuous and thus had to be tendered psychophysically at an earlier age(all laugh) and she used to say same and even John received that treatment(all laugh) but Drew still says no no some sort of test(all laugh) and then anyway,so she says,’Hi!Ash,today is the most pleasent day of my life and so on then said engagement’,’yeah nice to know very happy best wishes to both of you but infact you know this happiness as in categories like the one you have now and so on i asked for the intuitive suitability of these to realize the darkness and light interchanging as vision is constant that’s the fairy and dark on rock sea-saw hallucination(all burst into laughter) so i asked how do you feel when you get the taste of victory to the taste of satisfaction which preeceeds which and what is your opinion to properly manage the emotions behind this hallucination(all laugh) this i asked just after my Infernape,Emboar,Talonflame and Charizard got the upper hand over Tyranitar snatching away thus as a bet his whole day meal(all burst into laughter),Tyranitar said the idea of the mealed satisfaction is only a veil to hallucinate the hunger and thus then desire for better food and that if hallucinated then the desire remains neither the food nor the hunger(all burst into laughter) then i asked what would you do with it today(all burst into laughter) he said in protonumo-halogamos-promogostomor-lifyfas dark submask 7/12 th plane these brats got me when they answerd to my question that what is the root of this fraction(all burst into laughter) they slyly said,look lad(all laugh) your attempt at the logical chain of dangling rock floating in your ideas of the existence of a point at idealized wrong despondency of a partcular plane is no good cause the right despondency that you want to breach of that point being only a step not the worng that it’s necessary to get the chain for us to solve isn’t shining forth upon you hence your idealism(all burst into laughter) your question should’ve been without the idealism of fraction thus it should’ve been at 7/12 give me the 2 from 17(all burst into laughter) thus you’re not abound by this idealism of fraction that the root to 1 from 12 is halved by 7th quater out of 12 of your thought of idealism which can’t get the full path still so falls hence you get only 6th quarter of your thoughts used thus you surely reach 1 cause you can manipulate yourself ideally realizing the wrongs of the 1(all burst into laughter) so with this pure desire if focused then food is a hinderence so i will spend my day with the water types(all burst into laughter) thus i realized dark fairy see-saw is not on the rock but of that hence the happiness that we feel are of that not of the other so the happiness if categorized then from hapinness’ perspective this scale of sorrow is more gruelling hence the hallucination of will on idea(all burst into laughter) Melody said the last bit meant don’t give into the will(all laugh) so i realized this pest and his pets are most cunning brats(all laugh) then later i got him back at this said no idea and will interchange at a point which is the root of desire but only an appearence on the same(all burst into laughter) hence desire if pure as my Tyrie was telling me i understood isn’t compensetting to whim at all(all burst into laughter) then look why Melody is who she is she says,i realized he is talking about emotionless state with full knowledge of them and ways to get out only to get in again but hallucinating everything in and out thus a desire can’t get a grip on the being to satisfy itself or to drive it to something else despite the being throwing it up cause the knowledge of being counters it by guiding it around the emotions but not letting it grip any so it loses the satifiability to the being hence the being again refreshes itself from the self to throw the stronger desire so that to throw off that knowledge of itself which is working against it thus the whole process of self counter gets the being to drain the self more and when the self to being to desire knowledge too gets drained out so there’s no progress of being hence it silences now the vision is cleared of hallucinations thus the same becomes poignant(all burst into laughter) i was myself in this logic lost and John was laughing as well then Melody is so sweet said,um..why(all laugh),then in the meantime my bee got into that mood as well said the presentation of the prsence of a being guided by the being is truely poignant cause to stable ground is found hence if it’s mixed with self the being is busy with it and thus the presence is true(all laugh) this we realized the soul theory once more(all laugh) so then the siblings were too busy discussing these and we were forgotten(all laugh) so me and John was talking(all laugh) John said,all these recordings she had the previous two brats also heard and they even spoke once or twice with my bee and then Melody’s only requirement is such abstruse discussions and relate them to pokemons you know siblings do these similarly(all laugh) she is much more sane with attacks and battles though doesn’t teach these to her brats obsessively(all laugh) she herself likes to see how minds work and so on and Dave has that too much interest in proper battle and May is too sweet and reddened(all laugh) all these 4 are just so naive(all laugh)..and(laugh,all laugh) my bee is most obsessive among them(all laugh),only hence i’m so Gyaradosy(all laugh)..right(laugh,all laugh),then John was saying she used to listen to these recordings at times and that really gave her motivations after those devastating personal calamities and then she met him before he went undercover that showed her again he will be strictly professional but ever beside her no matter what even from next life and this really made her happy cause she had so few friends and her family support was absolutely 0 then and her name was tained at Safforn and so on but she was back,John as well at that time itself returned andwas there with her then they realized their bond of soulmates and married and went to Levender and in the meantime my bee was at Kalos and his abstruse discussions and all went to max degree(all laugh) and then Melody for one year or two wasn’t interested at all and John listened to the recordings many times(all laugh) and last year whole world came to know my bee’s activities and my adventures with starvation(all laugh) it was almost 15 years then since Melody met my hubby and then she by then was much normal and was again studying and all with her bunch then Muk intervened(all laugh) and thus came to her bro and so on but then she played a recording she said one of the funniest and this was just after he returned from Unovan Ciliution last year to none other than Hamish(all laugh) so this was congratulatory not for him after Limurainbow becomes special category 1st level fighting gym(all laugh),’Hellow Hamish,congrats heard the news of your special designation now and again congrats to you and your bunch for properly succeeding Mr Bruno i went there 20 years back first and you were 15 then me 16 then Mr Bruno said ok you may keep Primape and thus our grand relationship started and just from then to now congrats man you’ve grown up really fast(all burst into laughter)’,’Ash,you’re one long year older to me,why this senility(all laugh)’,’no it’s just what my Bulbasaur told me the other day you know that master brat you’re calculating the time between response to idea hence on the fly you’re fumbling as the disjunctiontion between moment to moment chain can’t hold the pressure of your existing inclination towards your specific being so you’re unable to get the self thus you’re thinking you’re a human being(all burst into laughter) this made me think that yeah i asked Bulbasaur ages ago the difference between inactivity and existence(all burst into laughter) he then itself said inactivity is the hallucination of existence if not active why existence and why this urge to know it if active then this urge only is the hindrence to the self cause the being is concsious of the self hence the other way around hence that’s not self at all so master brat,your answer is nothing can be pointed out as the to what is what that itself differentiates the inactivity from existence(all burst into laughter) just that my parents are older to me but why(all burst into laughter) cause all are the inaction of thoughts to cross the existence of this barrier of confinement of being so you see the two are interlinked hence the interlinking idea itself is difference and has many complex chains in it so at the end your idea of any relation of any kind within or outside of you is the exact trouble why you think you’re old(all burst into laughter) so i recalled that that this disjunction is getting vivid to me cause i’m getting old so the relations are blooming but that’s just psychophysicality of being a human that’s all man the idea that is that i’m beyond is why i don’t have any troubles now of the same idea(all burst into laughter) just self counter,Kommo-O said while drinking their tea i said getting cold said yeah lad just to show you that we know we will drink cold tea hence will regret it being hot but when very hot we want the cold tea and never the right heat that’s life lad it’s hard(all burst into laughter)..and we all were in tears laughing that how can a pokemon trainer first tries to make his pokemon the best philosopher HUMANLY possible(all laugh) second in return expects they will teach theirs to him which will absolutely be much better cause the idea of being is different but universal(all laugh) and to achieve this gives an idea of improving translators polishing it to heavens at the age of 17(all laugh) so that the GROSS PRODUCT(all laugh) is so strong that they will become what they are now due to THAT FEELING(all laugh) so yeah all of you three were USED(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “man,this is slow poisioning(all burst into laughter)..Misty any idea why did i keep that gym open that day and what he would’ve done if i didn’t despite the feelings(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “was telling me rock gym but Butterfree can sleep powder right(all burst into laughter)..then i said water pokemons you will need but yeah may visit to get a lesson you stupid jerk sweet..um..(all laugh)..then was desperate to enter(all laugh) then somehow managed cause Mr Slate had just returned and was as usual as he is just so naive(all laugh) later i was there first glance knew we were married(all laugh) during 3 day stay there told me why don’t you become a trainer as well friends inspire other friends(all laugh) i said well i’m just starting may be after spending some..um..time..um..(all laugh) said yeah have good chats as his skills  and all your experiences develop(all laugh)..and Brock was told..”
Brock(laugh) : “i myself knew these two are married for ages(all laugh) and dad said watch over as it unfolds(all burst into laughter) and later mom was told who scoffed at dad saying,SEE,TRAINER,ALL TYPES(all burst into laughter)..just so naive(all laugh)..but what about HUMAN philosophy(all burst into laughter)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “no really even Hector says himself says a Gengar(all laugh)..and today itself that brat Magearna came up told me crawl,walk,swim have you ever hopped between bushes Mr Skechit(all burst into laughter)..see Mr Skechit,this idea you have of different modes to do the same thing yet don't use any in any situations thus burdening yourself with this unnecessary knowledge why(all burst into laughter),cause he doesn't understand that this process to achieve one thing did it achive that or the previous like now he is swimming but Mr Skechit are you sure that this you're doing cause you think you walked at land hence(all burst into laughter),somehow send the great Claydol to hop with Magearna of all damn brats(all laugh)..and you know they namecall everyone now(all laugh)..Marshadow anyhow was tamed at my cost(all laugh)..the philosophy is..”
All in Unison(laugh) : “AH!JACKALING HUMAN!(all burst into laughter)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “well still even that would do(all laugh) but Mrs Oak what is at stock for Mr Oak(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “Mr Oak Mr Oak why is it called Mr(all burst into laughter)..”
Gary(laugh) : “no really man i proposed to Lil and next day return at night and that brat Reshiram asks Mr Oak do you know where you were yesterday in reality of the self cause that’s independent of this idea of space Mr Oak(all burst into laughter) and Darkrai addes in-between that signal and what we can read where he understands his type differences to veil both the halfs from himself(all burst into laughter) Mr Oak am i beginning to see the unfoldment of that unspecified state of being in you gradually deluging you in that feeling of intoxication of properly channelized unembodiment of being Mr Oak(all burst into laughter)..and Darkrai was his second brat from Kalos(all burst into laughter) was at lab for merely 3 months before then came in May totally insane and in June me and Lil realized our true bond and that moment of joy and all and then next day this brat wisely comments on that(all laugh) and in this short span he was pestering me anyway while he also picking up the Mr Oak namecall(all laugh) and then overall within one year this is the state(all laugh)..really man this master pest has ruined my work(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “grossly(all laugh) and Melody said Muk Skechit did what he does(all laugh) then with time these things the recordings really gripped her and John also was so so happy to listen to these infact he spoke a few times with my bee but he doesn’t remember so many people speak(all laugh) and on a few matters but he was Unown plus Melody was professional friend so rather too formal(all laugh) unlike when Kane and Brenda through Harris suggested Flavia and she knew Kane for ages and then Braum was just first sight manual as well so much abstrusely received..then Meldoy said realized the bond and he also was as you know for 16 years been speaking about Melody being once once talent which she too ture abstrusely are(all laugh) and so on so then Muk Muked them(all laugh) then she contacted Professor and those other tests then Sabrina and then Olivia,whoose role model is Meoldy(all laugh) and since beginning like 16 years has contacts(all laugh) and we never met Oliv in Kanto though only at Johto the 4 psychic competitions that my bee did Oliv might’ve been there but not against him we don’t recall neither she(all laugh) but Melody many times of course did 10 psychics then and so as you know they had more than contacts but that was professional rather so my hubby didn’t get the chain then through Oliv she came to know Mrs May Maple Blackmore of course(all laugh),but before that,then Melody contacted her and was too happy but still she also kept it a surprize(all laugh) and hence knew then finally realized all that stuff was just her big bro was only(all laugh) in the meantime big bro ever gets too emotional when it comes to his little sis as we all know(all laugh) and in recent times after each time her name came up in rosting her(all laugh) always next day or then tell me you know i wish i could tell her what Muk says hug the blinks of unbinding joy to get the real mentally that is(all burst into laughter) and you all were told as well too many times(all laugh) and then little sis proceeded after this more desperately(all laugh) so then asked Professor and then May,that was from Professor then Oliv was contacted and you know Melody too extremely frank so said everything(all laugh) then Tony boy(all laugh) then Drew then May who took a week to realize big sis actually knew her to be judgement day saviour(all laugh) then got the person(all laugh) and was too happy then finally we were contacted(all laugh) huge chain for about 6 months(all laugh) before that 6 months of contemplation(all laugh) started when my bee was still at Unova last year August then culminated to September this year(all laugh) and then all too happy(all laugh)..anyway,then my friends here said,your hubby has such a strange name,even totally eclipsed you in the whole place here but your name now is much more higher and that stardom isn’t associeted in that way but all rather respects you and those who wants that stardom are scared to death to even think about that or your that image(all laugh) i said yeah i’m given everything so that all i do is to battle and look after my pokemon as much as i want and all every trouble official and else those what i absolutely must to stay as legal gym leader only i do everything else all his even my own bunch he takes care of and from that to everything i only do according to my whims(all laugh) that’s why i let him off for 15 years to compenste for 45(all laugh) and he everyday discusses his knowledge with his bunch(all burst into laughter) thus so apt(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “the name toffee-flower(all burst into laughter,Misty bursts into laughter at same pose,Ash same pose,both laughs at each other),so...right(all laugh),so Trace what of the other days(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “no this brat has pestered me to death already(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “all to hold sways(all laugh)..anyway,so last week Dave did one then 3 days after that was special(all laugh) and then still Cili(all laugh) was something 1 hour on Bagon(all laugh) but Cilan knows the whole Unova and each breed(all laugh) dragon cause his gym is strict grass(all laugh) loaths dragons his elder bro and sister cause they are too demanding(all laugh) today was Dratini(all laugh) next week will be finally 2 hour special cause it’s Ash’s friend,philosopher and guide the great one and only Jangomo-O(all burst into laughter) this one Cilan said will be hard that too for 2 cause Ash knows about this one more than this one(all laugh) and this is part one only(all laugh) then next week Melody will be here finally and my subject is Dispoptas attack types(all laugh) Mr Oak Mr Oak did swelled up Arsoductyphorus conditions(all laugh) and then the middle Violet will say then the middle day it has to be that feeling(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “well first it was just 1 hour though the subject wanted 10(all laugh) and then what a discussion(all laugh) before that dad was instructed to be present at his personal dining table on the battlefield(all laugh) and then finally the little pest was in and Ash started with Diancie(all laugh) to keep the pest gounded(all laugh) then had the talk and all and finally when he says um..but that topic..(all laugh)..Ash said Mr Foster Slate,that topic will be from challengers perspective again next time won’t it be better food for thought(all laugh) that brat was happy finally and all(all laugh) but that feeling(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “yeah the day after Mr Oak Mr Oak it had to be that feeling(all laugh) what was the issue Doctor Brock Slate(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “this pest already humiliated me before saying it will be that feeling of longing(all laugh) then said to get the cup(all laugh) then goes on how to handle dissent(all burst into laughter) and that brat prepared the topic(all laugh) 11 situations given as well(all laugh) this brat is after my personal life(all laugh) and all were age and gender related and unrealted(all laugh) last one general philosophy(all laugh) and each he intensionally made exactly 11 minutes long(all laugh) and all got 1 hour and 7 minutes 10 being max and i had to carry on for 2 hours and 7 minutes with 20 max(all burst into laughter) what’s this weeks food(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well one will be there that’s Foster the great professional(all laugh) well that little pest is 30 now next year end will have the special nomination then if all is well around 8 years to all of fame(all laugh) and then you will see some fun when hall of fame gym leader asks first badge challenger what wrong did he do(all laugh)..but still the best as they say was the crooked show(all laugh) all said yeah all we know from here and there and all and yeah the different profession and even me i’m still no matter what just trainer and read a few things so the few ideas and words are there(all laugh) those we all get but that FEELING(all laugh) is your food next pokedissent(all burst into laughter,Brock .ly laughs)..”
Brock(laugh) : “those that are wild one week next week caught then how long they have been used unused and then how many battles(all laugh) this brat will get me insane(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “naively(all burst into laughter) and no none in the world can talk about pokedissent(all laugh) cause it’s that FEELING(all laugh) and Melody from next week the schedule will be reved up and it will be one hour for all Melody will be 2 cause it’s psychic(all laugh) plus the extra hour for battling with John(all laugh) so one part general the other is gym leader with John’s views(all laugh) so 2 will be as well for Dave cause it’s David(all laugh) but this all is except the special one(all laugh) it will be Cili first day(all laugh) cause he said my job is in oposite direction cause from Wednesday to Sunday all pesters me(all laugh) then Saturday will be Mr Oak or Mr Skechit or Mr Oak(all laugh) vacation both can’t go together so that disadvantage preyed upon(all laugh) and if i’m out still will return to hold(all laugh) and then will be Foster or Saul round on Wednesday(all laugh) either of the brats will be there(all laugh) if they don’t then Mr Slate and Mrs Slate will be(all laugh)..but um..what’s the type that Saul specializes in(all laugh)..Mist flower really it should’ve been you..”
Misty(laugh) : “if you only took me under the cover(all laugh)...so(all burst into laughter) then i would’ve handled Crawdauntogator but that would’ve been my last sane day(all laugh) these pests are making my personal life most vulgar(all laugh) and preaching that to the world(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “young flower dream(all burst into laughter,Misty laughs hugging Ash firmly,Ash same pose laughs)...right(all laugh),rocket duo would’ve been too happy if we both were there to blow the cover up(all laugh) so then Brawn will have Friday when he’s most happy cause next two holidays(all laugh) Dave is registered now with Hall of Fame and yeah he’s special category(all laugh) but still the battles will be there Saturday and Sunday at HQ in Lomstom(all laugh) each day must fit two matches so total 4 matches(all laugh) and Dave will get to face each Elite4 winner from any region on Thursday especial(all laugh) and for his speciality as hall of fame customs that you have a match each day or travel to face another hall of famer and so on the fixed matches on the weekdays atleast one you have to that Dave is getting with new Elite4 champ and he won’t travel so(laugh,all laugh) on another day any forsaken brat must battle Thursday from anywhere in the world(all laugh) must be at Lomstom and these 3 battles  travel and all expediture and Dave’s bunch’s recovery in one extra battle and then Thursday to Sunday each day he will battle so all those will be borne by Kalos(all laugh) and so David gets Tuesday 2 hours and then(all laugh) Sunday no matter where he is(all laugh) cause it’s the most important one that FEELING(all laugh) the day is about reflecting(all laugh) by all means so it’s that FEELING(all laugh) and Elite4 generally it is Monday-Wednesday the gyms and Friday-Saturday the Hall of Fame then Thursday you visit your old gyms where you want to go and they agree and then Sunday holiday thus the schedule that i was relieved from(all laugh) to do way more(all laugh) then Melody on Thursday cause that day being penultimate and after first 3 hazards John stays calm(all laugh) and then Friday is all over the place so Melody needs refreshments(all laugh) and gym when starts will be same(all laugh) then Friday finally is Brawn of all people(all laugh) cause i said unless you do i’ll force your name in special category(all laugh) and he takes his lunch with all people his family all in reservation(all laugh) where each is bemused(all laugh) and then Brawn is ever not busy(all laugh) and the round is very special for me cause it will be Mr Maple(all laugh) i couldn’t believe he will say that he wants to do i was overjoyed said look Normal types must get close to opponent most needed the mind game(all laugh) i said yeah i must concur(all laugh) and then if they are not available i’ve got my bros here to do it cause one has a Golem,Tapu Koko of all pokemons(all laugh) and Ampharos and Electrivite(all laugh) and won 1 competition at Kanto once and Johto once which was a tremendus match against a 3 time champ(all laugh) and the other is just so naive(all laugh) so that is set there and no i won’t disturb anyone on weekends(all laugh) so my schedule is Moday Cili(all laugh) for 1 hour on all sorts of pokemon breeding that’s found in Unova which will take eternity(all laugh) with him will be Mr Oak or Mr Skechit or Mr Oak(all laugh),then Tuesday Dave for 2 with him none can be(all laugh),Wednesday Foster or Saul round this week Saul with then will be Harmonica daughter of () cousin,3 time champ Orange and Unova double(all laugh) and runners up at Kalos(all laugh) which was second region(all laugh) first Orange win(all laugh),second that,third Kanto-round 32 faced Mist as well(all laugh),4th Unova win(all laugh),5th Unova Frontier win that month was the same when () passed on and last one with competitions held there then was shut down after that what her mental condition was still won shows what she is really is made of and she could still go to hall of fame with 3 regions left though had to win all but you can see more than 60% chance that would’ve but still decided not to and 3 time champs can’t become gym leaders but there the situation being so it was permitted now renovated general dragon gym at () and she comes round with Mrs Lillie(all laugh) Mrs Lillie Taubert Jolum,Hall of Fame,the only psudeo legend gym(all laugh),you all know that unique gym in Unova at Nacrene City origianlly was a fire gym with Reshiram and Groudon and Heatran everywhere(all laugh),her husband was a gym leader passed away 2 years after their marriage due to diseases stemming from an operation he had to do when he was injured in trying to handle a wild Reshiram who suddenly got into the gym area and caught him by surprize and didn’t have any children sadly and he was in hall of fame then Mrs Lillie Jolum applied got the gym extended to psudeo-legend gym now she is 59 i have that badge went there and she got her ways cause she is a 6 league,5-2 hall of fame(all laugh) and from the very city itself(all laugh) in Unova starter Goomy(all laugh) 1st region Kalos-win(all laugh),second-Orange win,third Unova Frontier-win(all laugh)..none startes from Unova cause then you don’t get dragons(all laugh),4th Unova-win(all laugh),5th Kanto -not win,6th Johto – win,7th Hoenn – not win,she said then got married cause wasn’t winning consistently(all laugh) then finally Sinnoh – Jasu(all laugh)..Sinnoh absolutely won then Elite4,Sinnoh win against Katy(all laugh) she,Lance and Taylor Hysturm from Mascobstar,Johto are only people to beat her when she was Elite4 head(all laugh),Katy i spoke with sometimes back now 77 but is as energetic as ever(all laugh) says my bunch is beyond repair thus your challenge to make them jovial(all laugh) now whole world wants to give their bunch to me to get atleast 3/4 jovial(all laugh) in pursuit of happiness(all laugh) where(all laugh) is that chosen tickling(all burst into laughter) some brats i have and Magmortgolem(all laugh) anyway,then back to Mrs Lillie Jolum i have a very warm and close relationship with her mom son kind and she is very kind to me like a mom and very happy i’m for this and she too knows Mist as well speaks and all very nice as you know,her gym was targetted as well she fled the scene in time like Mrs Olympia did(all laugh),() was caught totally unguarded and by utmost surprize thus the mishap and the world’s huge loss,Mrs Jolum she is ever in my contact and wants to join in the discussion i humbly oblidged then and her gym is the only place where it’s 4 on 4(all laugh) that had to be cause a draw there means you’re a champ already(all laugh) hardest place to go to in Unova but that is a special case so () gym was the hardest gym in general dragons but well(all laugh) such gyms anywhere is hard(all laugh) and then Thursday Melody for 2 and that is all,Friday Brawn or Mr Maple round with them being the last day of week it has to be that FEELING(all laugh) special so 2 hours total 3(all laugh) and infact i only had Mrs Jolum and Mr Maple’s place as vacant other people would anyway do(all laugh) infact Harmonica says can’t gyms shift to Kanto(all laugh) so sweet girl she is in nature and barely saw me face to face but just Cili(all laugh) actually i’ll have to visit Unova and Kalos round each week you know that(all laugh) and Brawn was threatened(all laugh) if the gym leaders aren’t available Jasu or McShin must oblidge as many times(all laugh) if not Mark,Wendy and Ivana will(all laugh) and if still not Cynthia will be unable to sleep(all laugh) any of those brats must oblidge even from other worlds(all laugh) and then other cases both hall of fames will be raided(all laugh) then weekends off but you see 779 people want me(all laugh) then overall other people included 850 total people want me(all laugh) then this excludes Saul and Junia,Boulder(all laugh),that little pest Max(all laugh) his soulmate Mia who is a way more desparate simulator thus the longing(all laugh) my 4 comrades here(all laugh) and their comrades(all laugh) then Dawn,Iris all with their family and Sabrina(all laugh) then finally you all(all laugh) and Sarah ‘mam(all laugh),Brauchy man(all burst into laughter),Vickie boy(all laugh) then Hana sis(all laugh) and still whole staffs all want me Arthur all time(all laugh) and then the lab staffs Lenny and all and overall now all gyms i visited so 1600 people want me(all laugh) then the whole world pokemons want me(all laugh) but my bunch don’t(all laugh) 2 hours with those brats are enough now(all laugh) but each day(all laugh) if not subtle(all laugh) and with Gengleye in charge it’s extremely dangerous now(all laugh) each brat extremely vulgar(all laugh) and my poor wife gets the chop(all laugh) i said don’t insult my wife is it girlfriend’s beau(all laugh) substandard(all laugh) and how 2nd brat bodyslams master brat and viseversa(all laugh) Mist was there they pestered her to death saying this is all cause the master brat is countering(all burst into laughter) Mist can’t fondle them they will(all laugh) in nerveous channels(all laugh) and Mist says how can i communicate with people cause a challenger releases a pokemon and that means that pokemon is moleing to see the possibilty of getting her pokemons as the challengers beau’s beaus’ beaus(all laugh) beau counting(all laugh) and we have Gyarados,Jellicent and now welcome that brat Kyogre(all laugh) that brat was the only water psudo legend all has and i don’t(all laugh) but that pest now is a master at challenger lulling(all laugh) asks the challenger to race first when he doesn’t cries his head off(all laugh) then the challenger attacks defends and sobs that he will die why not race(all laugh) then all this gets the challeger to get irritated then that brat charges at Mist(all laugh) gets the challengers baffled then zaps to the challenger platform saying you lost na na(all burst into laughter) pesters whole time and finally when the challenger is at total bay he attacks and gets the win(all laugh) but when the ref is counting he fondles the challenger(all burst into laughter) cries his head off apologizes fervantly(all laugh) learnt from those two feathered pests(all laugh) and even now that is going on there(all laugh) and all this gets Mist to hand the badge over after one round and flee(all laugh) to me(all burst into laughter)...right(all laugh) and in my 1 hour travel is something(all laugh) Gengleye and Deoxlucha pesteres me all the way(all laugh) Hawlucha and Deoxys while i go and those two ghosts while i return(all laugh) then Hawlucha and returns and lectures me(all laugh) in the morning Deoxys comes to take me there(all laugh) and first gives my report to Mist then the viseversa(all burst into laughter) and then during break 5 pests enter here each day(all laugh) 30 minutes on what i’m doing at lab and then the reservation 1 hour then come back and tells me how 2nd master is planning to bodyslam me(all laugh) and a few in her bunch are getting standard(all laugh) but they are forced to eat substandard food by idiotic 2nd master(all laugh) they want the 2nd master to be spoiled like me(all laugh)..right(all laugh) and Goldy can’t proceed further than saying substandard food and still battling seriously though only for a couple of minutes(all laugh) and only 3 days(all laugh) is no good cause that 2 minute is serious(all laugh) so then around 1600 people want me and still i’ve not spoken about many former gym leaders(all laugh) total 1700 people want me then my bunch and then i talk with Professor each day and all still this doesn’t include my mom whom Mist handles(all laugh) i have very little time to give her for which she is so happy(all laugh) and then all those but finally my Mist flower(all laugh) Mist gets an hour only(all laugh) 30 minutes for talking only in the morning(all laugh) and the rest is just silence(all laugh) but this excludes the fact that she is holding my hand whole time i’m in gym(all laugh) and i get her to be too close(all laugh)..fine(all burst into laughter) but with 1700 people it’s something really(all laugh) yeah well my phone has 1704 contacts(all laugh) mom,Professor,Mist is there and there is TYRAniTAR(all laugh)...but all i said about pests entering here to spoil 2nd master and all is not normal(all laugh) so Mist,how was my normal schedule last week that will be reved up from this(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “after you describe Deoxys and your antics inside hallucinations(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh,hugging Misty firmly,Misty also laughs at Ash and hugs him firmly) : “well Deoxys showed a few very real hallucinations with which i can only be 140 seonds at once(all laugh) Deoxys started with showing many all of my bunch and ghost and psychics facing each other as opponents MENTALLY(all laugh) where Deoxys isn’t present(all laugh) then Deoxys comes in at a time when all the opposing gang has become a couple due to too much competitive bonhomie(all burst into laughter) so he has three choised brats with him as Dusknoir and Darkrai and Malamar but Malamar rejects him cause he is more insterested in the dark portion backstabbing him(all laugh) so the three turns on him saying find a illegal beau or else you’ll be shoved down a leagl infatuated one(all burst into laughter) then Deoxys shows another Deoxys who is infatuated with him(all laugh) but Deoxys uses her to create a rift between Dusknoir and Darkrai(all burst into laughter) then rejects the brat and Darkrai wisely points out to Dusknoir that pure ghost and pure psychic hum..lad has brains(all burst into laughter)..this was one and another was 2nd master she was busy with Golduck when master brat send him to check on Golduck’s moods and then irritate him so that 2nd master gets busy handling him then after sometimes 2nd master is irritaed by Golduck and recalls him when Deoxys tells me that now is the time and zaps me to 2nd master so that she immediately bodyslamms me cause she is very dissapointed with her pokebeau thus field is prepared for my moment,maddening(all uncontrollbaly laugh) then the last was substandard Lugias among whom one has brains but his beau is hindering him cause Garchomp rejected her as illegal beau the concent she herself told her(all burst into laughter) and Latios is exactly who is Lugia’s target,get one not getting one who whats your one who is want’s to test you to make you one thus lulling your current one into own another illegal one rubbing this one to reject you so now Garchomp will be too interested in your targeted one and your one on you thus you show the mettle to break away the one or to be with one whoever’s the most ENGAGING(all uncontrollably laugh,tears)..but Garchomp was the one to tell the illegal concept to our Lugia cause he wants Ultranercozma as illegal beau thus was trying to shove away Latios but then Latios too picked it up cunning(all burst into laughter)...this was two hallucinations and Melody was in tears as was John laughing that what level of vulgaity these brats have reached(all laugh) and Melody especially with all says only if i got a Deoxys during Kalos(all laugh) then finally the conclusion was 2nd master battling substandard food to make her bunch unhappy with her so they come to me but my bunch takes them away from me so that now i’m dissapointed not to get illegal beuas and get back to 2nd master when she bodyslams me saying only i BOOK you(all uncontrollbaly laugh)...right(all burst into laughter),this plan was set up using Deoxys appeasing him with 3 brats of her who can be illegally endearing(all burst into laughter) after this i stopped that brat(all laugh) and my sis and bro-in-law were almost unconscious laughing(all laugh) and Mist too was trying to join them(all laugh) what brats these are(all laugh)..well i’ll have to go to Unova on Saturday and return Sunday twice a week both Mrs Jolum and Harmonica is hellbent on it and i really can’t refuse like my aunt and cousin(all laugh) and no Mrs Jolum is ok but Harmonica needs help really with that brat Mark there who thinks the cabin is the platform actually(all laugh) and there i’ll go in rounds and Mrs Jolum is too fond of me since the first day just both for no reasons at all(all laugh) and i told Harmonica that look you’re a 3 time champ from 5 regions to begin with,why so shaky now suddenly,and she so sweetly says,’um..no because gym leading i can battle but so many lanlodrs and ladies(all laugh) and uncle told me you know the lives of pokemons very well(all laugh)’ i said fine(all laugh) she behaves like a little kid for no reason as well seen me at Unova 3/4 times max here many times Video calls(all laugh) extremely good battler but just too sweet girl her whole family infact says no you were praised much(all laugh) i said well my good fortune and Kalos i’m a guest to Persy and Samantha(all laugh) there other places i’ll go to a few Cili is one(all laugh) but none of those two pests will be sane if ‘mam goes there(all laugh) and so 3 weeks engaged there Mist flower will be with me(all laugh) especially in Unova(all laugh) and this had to be there cause Mist really needs vacation(all laugh) the other weekend will be at lab(all laugh) and if another then my siblings at Cerulian(all laugh) thus you see life is hard(all laugh)..so then how’s the schedule and booking(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “i can change the schedule if i want to book him(all laugh)...well(laugh,all laugh),my  hubby was describing silent pictures suiting to his and that brat’s needs of course(all laugh) and schedule is,sleep for 0 hours(all laugh) cause the rest is managed with with 7.5 hours subtle body(all laugh) that gives 5 hours of sleep and normal time 6 hours of his bunch’s vulgarity(all laugh) the other 1.5 hour is jumping around as you know(all laugh) well i have to do that to rather babysitted to do that on dragon travel but this is more subtle(all laugh) and i desperately again resist this from happening to me(all laugh) and 10 minutes to get prepared first cause he is absolutely knackred when he goes to sleep(all laugh) and then sane after 7.5 hours(all laugh) that he was telling Melody and she of all people became so grave and hugged him almost sobbing that i don’t want to lose my bro(all laugh) and then i was hugged to inform me that more is my participation the more he will be unable to go(all laugh) i said he practised it while at Elite4 HQ at night(all laugh) and i was nowhere almost in conscious mind only subconscious and he has practised it may be 30 times before last two weeks(all laugh) has the confidence and yeah i told him i will immediately follow him with his own bunch if he loses it there so he is ok and he said same risk as that of a nightmare(all laugh) and you know the stuffs he says this was practised before but 7.5 hours then sleep plus communication that’s something(all laugh) and then this Magmortgolem can’t join cause of different nature so for them another session(all laugh) and it’s incredible that his bunch and Magmortgolem bossom pests(all laugh) but they don’t get these internal communications neith do they know what my bee buzzes to them(all laugh) but yet both are absolutely same behaviour with him knows that he will communicate and that’s enough for them and no Gary or anyone can’t turn those two on against even me(all laugh) and this also in max swelled state(all laugh) but i afraid that Dosey,Jelli and Kyog will soon follow suit(all laugh) they want to battle all time using one attack at full force last moment only(all laugh) and my Gryarados the real gym leader since i started now calls me non-intellectual(all laugh)...my(all laugh) sweet bee...so(all laugh)...my(laugh,all laugh) Ash has spoiled the gym brats as well(all laugh) and then his day starts at 00:05(all laugh) he walks off after putting me to sleep by treating me like newborn(all laugh) and if i say one word it means he is ulterior and when i sleep he will leave me(all burst into laughter)...my(all laugh) sweet hubby(all laugh)..and(all laugh) then he goes to reservation passes an hour with them in psychic channels of course(all laugh) and those two feathered brats are out of there then only(all laugh) but sadly they are at battlefield and beside me(all laugh) then comes back to the other room where whole world that is in time(all laugh) will be summoned and then his mails and texts and all and all kinds of troubles of gym(all laugh) yeah he doesn’t waste time from our room Jellicent which pest as captured him(all laugh) will zap Hawlucha to our room and my bee tells Hawlucha to be not thinking means be prepared at jovial best for protection against his own break-ins(all burst into laughter) then Jellicent will zap him to reservation along with Starew and then Talonflame goes inside the pokeball to get his form upto max later(all laugh) then Jellicent will zap to my bed(all laugh) and will ask Starmie to gauge if i’m dreaming well and Hawlucha will tell him all is substandard(all laugh) means everthing is not intersting that is neither Starmie nor me or any break-in can give him reason to think even less(all laugh) means nothing has happened of any disturbance(all laugh) well i’m too protected against even humans now i guess with their form(all laugh) as girlfriend’s beaus are still not standard yet so is girlfriend(all laugh) God bless the people who invented this word(all laugh) then Jellicent will zap back and return to inform my bee who only then being assured of his flower’s beauty nap and Hawlucha’s assurence cause Starmie only looks after me and Hawlucha is guard by not guarding(all laugh) then my bee will go to psychic channels(all laugh) this takes 8-10 minutes(all laugh) then he is there then comes back zapping again by Jellicent to our room and sends off Hawlucha and before coming he relseases Talonflame again and Hawlucha is now joined and Jellicent too returns and the two birds having been bored now gets to tremendus form there with my 3 brats(all laugh) and Starew is returned to join Starmie to tell her the proceedings(all laugh) then my bee tenders my hairs for 5 minutes to gauge how beautiful i’m not physically(all laugh) but that FEELING(all laugh) hair cause it falls away so making sure that he despite his inner feelings for me still cares about my body and mind in this form to tender them to newborn(all burst into laughter) then goes to the room beside at 1:35 and starts his day of contact and gym maintaining(all laugh) so he goes to call first the first timezone from 1:40 around then where is 8:40(all laugh) then each by 1 hour when they are at 8:20(all laugh) and the list is maintained if trainers or something where they are at and all and he hasn’t spoken about how many trainers and all he knows(all laugh) now total 2107 contacts(all laugh) and he remembers them by studying(all laugh) so barring mom,Professor,me there’s another two very special contacts that’s in one group one is of course TYRAniTAR(all laugh) and guess another very important and special..”
Gary(laugh) : “i get it(all burst into laughter),this brat ever needs me for two words and even will summon me to or from the next world(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “Ash am i not you sweet little big sis(all burst into laughter)..”

Brock(laugh) : “i’m happy that this brat has let me off after 21 years(all laugh)..”
Tracey(laugh) : “and i’m saved from psychothrombonosis(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “and using this schism i’ll get in between sways(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “no Mr Oak Mr Oak with all of you are in different group where your designations are-
Gross Professional Help and Gross Needs(all burst into laughter) – the contact is Gary Mr Oak Mr Oak(all laugh),gross professional help is facts(all laugh) like the word soulmate(all laugh) textbook lexicon that is(all laugh) and gross need means all illegal subtances(all laugh) and gross also means facts like if i have this idea of professional discussion then Mr Oak must validate it as Mr Oak(all laugh) like calling someone friend then what kind of frined his intuition must be validated by Mr Oak(all laugh)..
Subtle Professional Help and Emotional Needs(all laugh) – the contact is Dr Tracey Muk Skechit(all laugh),subtle means that observation which are the FEELINGS(all laugh) and 100 ft circle emotional managment without looking at the concerned person or talking(all laugh) else psychothrombonosis(all laugh) which i desparetly resist each day from getting taught by him by looking at his framed pictures and moisting them listinging to his sweneting talks that i have to record(all burst into laughter) and all this i do during breaks cause there’s no way to stop him otherwise cause no matter what he gets me cornered(all laugh) and i desperately again resist his jumping methods from happening to me cause i said first time why don’t you like my current form(all burst into laughter) mom was called and so on to prove he is ulterior and so on(all laugh) and most heinously said Mist i didn’t marry you properly did i went away so quickly after marriage and yeah all those mere wordplay so i didn’t marry you in the proper way and exactly saying this i’m hurting you so i’m definitely ulterior(all burst into laughter) and these while tendering me like a newborn(all laugh) that was enough for me to not say it again so these methods(all laugh)..so these are done to get the job done and the recorder and call recorder is abused thus(all laugh) anyway,then

Daisy(laugh) : “Ketchum i’ll mingle in foods(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “a jackal for a day(all burst into laughter)/if 108 added with it Daisyl where’s your way out of bay(all laugh)..DaisyDaisyl(all laugh)...no really such a great perfect name(all laugh)..and eldest sister help is serious family WIDE issues(all laugh) or any issues of personal or professional imaginable(all laugh) and if no issues then will be created jointly with the jackal to assist the foxing(all lugh) cause Dase manages everything that he can’t manage at lab when he is out cold for 7.5 hours(all laugh) jumping(all laugh) and only Dase can babysit him(all laugh)...so how is that experience Dase cause these few weeks my bee has been at stupendus form as is his bunch and Magmortgolem(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “too demanding(all laugh) first my schedule is known by each minute(all laugh) then ConHoopa is summoned as to their reports on mental pressure on me and my dolls(all laugh) they vulgarize everything(all laugh) and then i’ll be asked for dinner and then before what’s in lunch and so on(all laugh) then will sit beside me in table and behave like 5 year old(all laugh) and ask me of my experiences every minute of my life(all laugh) and so on will go asks for personal advises on how to deal with random people(all laugh),who to politely tell people he has to leave the call(all laugh) and so on(all laugh) this is some experience cause everyone else is fondled to death(all laugh)..Trace is monitored as to if he is getting too oblivious(all laugh) then he will be chided to absolute vulgarity by Glaheeyem(all laugh) and so on and Gary is ever monitored for the balance by now Giragius(all laugh),Doctor Slate is ever babysitted for being too naive by recently formed Duskshadow(all laugh),Violet is most honoured so has Bayleaf’s 3rd and 5th  daughter for company(all burst into laughter) those are absolute definition of in-born brats(all laugh) and gets whatever she wants and Lillie is kept happy by chosen brats such as Darkramar(all laugh) then all the staffs and so on and Mrs Ketchum is dealt with as to doing too much with all things thus she is too happy and lets him have his ways with his sisters(all laugh) but i will be pestered to death by all those brats outside and inside but all else will be kept happy and whenever i’m become Daisyl Conhoopa will vulgarize my life showing i’m jealous of Marill especially(all burst into laughter,Tracey uncontrollably laughs) and our trouble is that master brat has taught them to identify not males and now with their condition they are anyway able to so while our Mist flower is not not male we’re not so so get the chop(all laugh) and they understand that Mist flower isn’t a not not male cause of the fact that they mingle with her bunch now(all laugh) and Chu was here so her not not male signals were different so it was actually then when this master brat had played the most crooked trick(all laugh) he showed them that no matter what,he likes his Mist flower too much(all laugh) by hugging her to death EACH DAY FOR AN HOUR IN FRONT OF EVERYONE(all laugh) so like Mrs Ketchum they do realize her as well like Mist to be a not male but master brat likes both too much like his bunch(all laugh) so that special bond means they are half human half pokemon so the not not male still exists cause that’s the human part the not male is the pokemon part(all burst into laughter) hence as they are HUMAN major(all burst into laughter),they are spared but we have had no luck at all(all laugh) thus i must become Daisy and brosist their master(all laugh) and my prize is that the jackal will get his ways helped by this cunning bro himself with me making me Daisyl again by various means(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “see only i book my bee(all laugh) surely my bee to get me has ever trapped my sisters(all laugh) and then the contact is Mrs Lillie Garywig(all laugh) this is confidence sister help(all burst into laughter) that means Lil is fed her lion(all laugh) as this means she will be in between sways and will let her little bro have shares(all laugh) this is for intuition(all laugh) then Mrs Violet Slate Expert Mantine and only can be Mantine(all laugh) then other group is siblings group(all laugh) that has May the sister-pester(all laugh) then(laugh) Drew shrewdly SPEWED(all

only if you told those midnight libraries would’ve been with wife(all laugh) she as you know is way more free with my bee now after 9 years of elusive behaviour(all laugh) and Kane doesn’t like it of course(all laugh) cause there are traps set for him(all laugh) and Brenda’s note is VIRIZ(all laugh)..that voice is something(all laugh) and Brenda has been told this and each day pesters Harris(all laugh) then Olivia is written differently in total as Olivia Tony’s psycho(all burst into laughter) i told her she asked him,what is it Ash that i always get this tag(all laugh) i said just that blooming youth(all burst into laughter) she also ever is too free with both of us cause knows both of us for 17/18 years(all laugh) well all of them are actually Olivia just too much and now Irie too(all laugh) and then finally Flavia is next Brauchy man(all laugh) she is most tendered like little big sis Lil(all laugh) and Brenda is most honoured like Viol sister Mantine(all laugh) so they are also pestered at times but less(all laugh) the other two are Daisyl(all laugh) Olivia of course the most(all laugh) and none of the hubbies want their dear wives to get spoiled by my bee(all laugh) cause each are shown tricking methdos(all laugh) all says man you spoil people(all laugh) but Jane is most honoured in real sense(all laugh) cause Cili(all laugh)..that tone is also impossible (all laugh) and Cilan and Jane talks with me once a week and asks for if i’m looked after by him and not Giratina(all laugh) i say by both(all laugh) and Jane adores my bee too much says no ‘mam he got the views to a new degree really(all laugh) so it helps and mostly he’s so attractive a Gengar(all laugh) i said yeah hence my mask(all laugh) they now know everything which has made sure that they honour me even more cause a hubby like my bee is hard indeed to manage(all laugh) then Cilan ever says no he is a Gengar for sure but still ‘mam Huntelion hasn’t left him beware(all laugh) i say,yeah it’s everywhere now(all laugh)..then Mr and Mrs Maple and Boulder is in groups by gym city and names but Boulder is only thus written(all laugh) then others Dawn and Oliver and Iris and

written as senor in magazines(all laugh) and kept aside in a special group named senor(all laugh) then Saul is there special gym with Junia who are too fond of Gengarian philosphy as you know(all laugh) Saul’s note is pet(all laugh) and Junia is pet’s half(all laugh) Junia still says,Misty if you were present that day the fun we had he requested for a slideslow with only one picture just(all laugh) was Salamence,Latias and Palkia(all laugh) each 30 minutes with 20+10 for our questions so was 1.5 hour full of fun and then those happen at Orange with you we couldn’t immediately leave but never forgetting that discourse for sure(all laugh) and Saul says no ever heard about him but that 1.5 hours was something indeed(all laugh) then the succeeding hours after i hear the additional Palkian life(all laugh) and Lance taming methods with regional distributions that too recorded(all laugh) i knew no way i was leaving this man(all laugh) and slideshow was where he told them about his experience and what he knew abou Salamence in brief and then joked with them with his questing rules(all laugh) Junia said as a ranger i ever had troubles managing Palkian problems with people(all laugh) but the the questions made my day but the Palkian life is something indeed(all laugh) and the great Palkia with Butterfree,Latios and Kyurem the antics they did here is just Gengar(all laugh) but then there’s that group(laugh) a glimpse at beauty(all burst into laughter) and you know they have the grass group and expertise swelling there(both laugh) and the rest are out of profession still sometimes contact to give conference newes for philosophical views on home decoration(all laugh) then Siblings group has his siblings only else they are at separate places as well like Melody and May and Dave another sisters and bro(all laugh) and else legal financial etc has Susan and Javier then Zara is there and so on then innumerable groups are there according to time given reflecting closure(all laugh) then all else and our group is just home it’s Mom,Professor,Mist and Tyranitar(all laugh) and no the special persons actually are dad and mom and dad full name all profession everything is written number is for here the gym first two digits each and for there mom’s number first 3 digits(all smile) but(laugh) there’s a reason for that as you know him,says,had dad been here i would’ve first thing after 3rd gym said i’ve found my best friend(all laugh) that is the insinuation to keep an eye on both of us cause of the obvious vulgarity(all laugh) and then during Unova he says,dad would’ve anyway been there after that picture(all laugh) so would’ve dragged him to Huntelion as well(all laugh) and now here cause(laugh) 5 years minimum(all burst into laughter) and then must be here cause it’s not DESTINY(all laugh) and then mom and dad here says,mom is the gentler version of DaisyLil(all burst into laughter) just so naive(all laugh) and dad is(laugh) baby Brock(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,Brock shakes his head laughing)..”
Brock(laugh) : “man should’ve never became a gym leader(all laugh)..that day was the beginning of the end(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “AH!BROCK AS BABY(all burst into laughter)..”
Ash(laugh) : “just so naive(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “in that feeling(all laugh)..then there’s more people who are barred from general contact that’s Harmonica cause she kinda looks up to him as big bro and () spoke very fondly of him to her and did speak before now very close and also calls me all times just a very sweet girl 9 years younger to us she is,Mrs Jolum same it’s like mom and son relation also knows me and calls and always so nice,Sabrina ever our elder sis(all laugh),Lance cause of drama writting,directing and producing(all laugh),Simon cause of henchmen(all laugh),Persy Kalos(all laugh) yeah that’s written there(all laugh),Samantha the Persy beau(all laugh),Jack moles Jasu(all burst into laughter) that actually call came he was in washroom and i received cause this group i must(all laugh) and i saw that was laughing and Jack said what(all laugh) i told him he was laughing so much says none in the world can call a Elite4 head in his office saying that(all laugh) even Dave doesn’t(all laugh)..Jasu(all laugh)..no i can never do that voice(all laugh) but i can call him Jasu(all burst into laughter) and McShin also i can call that or Stu(all laugh) well you know everything circles according to my whims(all laugh),then of course there’s Sarah and family group,Arthur group,Grotham group(all laugh) and so on(all laugh),then there’s a few more hundered(all laugh) and then 1530 other people(all laugh) yeah 200 must contact and then 100 more home(all laugh) then 800 people are to be given 3 minutes per month(all laugh) and 1.5 minutes to rememer them upto present(all laugh) so each day 2 hours go(all laugh) then those who are given more and all another 4 is given(all laugh) 6 hours he talks(all laugh) and of course most are from Unova(all laugh) Unova,Kalos,Sinnoh is the order and yeah Sinnoh isn’t talked about cause of the other two but he knows everything in Sinnoh and everyone(all laugh) so infact Kalos and Sinnoh are same just he knows more gyms and all in Kalos and Universities of course(all laugh) but Cerulian has only technical university so a trouble(all laugh) so at night from 1:40 it goes on then his own preparations studies few snacks the reports everything(all laugh) reports Sarah must point things out  he will review them and the language if needs to be changed(all laugh) all this takes 7 hours to 8:50(all laugh) cause in between he calls many in Sinnoh and all who are very close and etc like Mrs Jolum and Harmonica and also their talks if needed to be recorded(all laugh) then reports are seen later and when he is working i don’t disturb him cause that means he doesn’t cherish me(all laugh) which is my gym will be delayed by an hour which as usual is going to mean 3 brats will get their ways in one on one(all laugh) so at 8:50 he calls me(all laugh) ‘Mist do you feel like you can continue today at gym if not just use Gyarados,Kyogre and Jellicent(all laugh) and sweetie seat down on platform(all burst into laughter) this provision is being thought about as i said it should be allowed for all age not only above 48 for women and 53 for men(all laugh) and have you kept energy drinks take a sip sometimes dear(all burst into laughter) don’t neglect your health,hum(all laugh) but only if stomach is 60% full(all burst into laughter) and never let it go down to 10%(all laugh)’ 5 minutes of babysitting will go on then just when i say yeah i must now go cause challengers are on the platform(all laugh) he will say,’alright Mist i’m going in you now(all laugh)’ that’s the message i’m not allowed to say of what(all laugh,Misty smiles at Ash who smiles at Misty both same pose after quickly hugging each other) then i’m too sweetened to be alright(all laugh) so the challenger will wait for 10 more minutes to 9:15(all laugh) which is made up as the first pokemon has to be Gyarados(all laugh) total joke goes on there(all laugh) and then as soon as the first one is returned or goes i recall that brat and send someone else then as soon as the match finishes Dosey is sent off as she has a limit if that is crossed will come out first thing(all laugh) then first after break has to be Jellicent after the pests tell them more tricks during(all laugh) and same thing then last match has to be Kyogre first for whole day’s comic relief and he does his tricks and as soon as day finishes if Goldy is used in the middle he too substandard food(all laugh) yeah a 7 time 8th region came last week as i told sadly for the last match and got Kyogre(all laugh) well for any 2+ i must use either of the 3 brats(all laugh) and this was anyway last so Kyog was there and then over the moon,’yeah Mrs Ketchum this gym and you and Mr Ketchum all knows so your bunch is practising with his as well i guess(all laugh)’ i was thinking is that even a complement(all laugh) Mrs Ketchum is judged only with the other rounds(all laugh) and now she is dreaded name(all laugh) then he wanted my contact and all and then the next two rounds he smoked me off with Kyurem(all laugh) and still said no Kyogre could beat full 10(all laugh) i was thinking atleast Kyog isn’t vulgar(all laugh) and beside Kaledo,Tapu Fini,Manaphy and Phione,Kyog is the ONLY psudeo legend here as there’s no more unless dragons(all laugh) and thank God those two pests don’t get into the pool(all laugh) and so on my bee has made sure i get too much attention but from people whoose attention i wanted to catch so much(all laugh) McShin’s secretary himself calls me each week to ask if all is alright or not(all laugh) Sarah says,’Misty what will happen if he spoils the whole gym(all laugh)’ i said then then we will get thrice the money with absolutely no work cause it will be a world adored circus as a heritage tourist spot(all laugh) and yeah even the general munipal corporation calls me once a month to know all things(all laugh) and the reason is that press conference-my,my,my,what a pleasure(all laugh) and all this goes on and after the day complain comes that food was pathetic(all laugh) 2nd master gives better psychic food and his brats are way happier why are we told to be serious(all laugh) and i only laugh that atleast they don’t call me idiotic brat(all laugh) and Dosey’s beau is like Goldy and those two pests are at each other whole day(all laugh) but Goldy is still inferior cause he is infatuated with me(all burst into laughter) yeah those pests reintroduced this word too much bonhomie(all laugh) and my whole life has been abjectly vulgarized and then being broadcasted to the whole world(all laugh) anyway(laugh,all laugh), then he will go out to the lab where he will reach by 9:25(all laugh) then that is dinner(all laugh) and all upto 10:25 then goes blank from 10:55 to 18:25(all laugh) in between Snorlax too takes nap with Buzzwole of course(all laugh) then Magmortgolem gets in for half an hour and full group for another 15 minutes to 19:10 then others get 30 minutes and then discussions while lunch(all laugh) and all upto 22:15 returns at 22:35 at extreme pace(all laugh) or so and this is adjustable with calls and all(all laugh) then as he ruturns and takes shower and all tells Jellicent and Gengleye to do the jobs for him and Gengeleye goes to Brauch and Jellicent zaps him to me after he gets freshed and all in 20 minutes(all laugh) then whole world is shut down from 22:55-23:55(all laugh) then 10 minutes he will tender me to maximum to sleep if preceeding wasn’t enough(all laugh) and off again and i have to tell him everything in 1 hour(all laugh) and my life is too comfortable with reports and all(all laugh) but my schedule is i sleep from 00:30-06:00 then go to get prepared till 8:00 when pests attack me(all laugh) today came Reshiram(all laugh),Krookodile,Infernape(all laugh),Lycanroc(all laugh),Ultranercozma(all laugh),Grumpig,Deoxys,Noctowl,Magearna(all laugh),Banette(all laugh) and those pests give Gyarados the last moment tips(all laugh) then they return with my bee and then i gym battle from 9:15 only(all laugh) and upto the break while all things are too ready(all laugh) with a few calls that i have to do in his absence and my own and else(all laugh) then during break the same hopefully the pests then are at subtle states(all laugh) while Magmortgolem protects them and jackal observes the procedure(all laugh),Mr Oak Mr Oak is incensed with everything(all laugh) and Doctor Slate is at total bay(all laugh),Dase becomes Daisyl to sentimantally chide the whole world off(all laugh) Lil gets in between sawys to hold sway(all laugh) and Viol forgets she needs her voice to be intact for performances later(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing) Mime sadly now joins in jumping as well due to time shortage(all laugh) but hopefully doesn’t stay more than an hour(all laugh) and Muk stays one hour less only(all laugh) which Mime fills(all laugh) and 24 is made 25 somehow to talk with all of you personally(all laugh) then weekends is for all reports on his bunch and so on and for talking with siblings for more than 2.5 minutes(all laugh) and still the normal day is made 28(all laugh) and he knows everything that is happening in Unova at every corner day to day,Sinnoh now totally Jack’s department(all laugh) and Kanto is Dave’s(all laugh),Orange is of course fed to Gengarian philosophers(all laugh) and Saul as well knows everything in gym sections at Kanto and now has John and Melody and Foster the great professional(all laugh) so Kanto is fully known to him via proxy like Sinnoh and Dave also knows everything about Sinnoh(all laugh) and then Hoenn and Johto is spared due to family reasons(all laugh) and then there’s our beloved Kalos(all laugh) where the Elite4 head and his hall of fame wife themselves tell him everything(all laugh) and Unova he has Cilan but Unova you know sensei(all laugh) so he has to serve sensei so special awareness(all laugh) and his travel plans you know now 2 weekends at Unova,one at Kalos HQ(all laugh) all of which i go as special guest(all laugh) one midweek Wednesday at Sinnoh at Jack’s place that is Elite4 HQ with Jasu(all laugh) and the Unovan discussion with Cili will be there then both times will be at Cili’s place himself(all laugh) and then the other all 3 midweeks infact will be round trips to Melody and May and Max and also Pettlesberg and then one friday that he is free there is special dinner with night stay for both of us at AH!BOULDER!BOULDER!(all laugh)..and then on a Monday or any other day Saul’s den is also visited(all laugh)..so huge plans and i understand what sort of schedule he is habituated to now this one year had to tender his Mist flower to absolute babysitting maxima(all laugh) and none wants to come here cause none can in 2 hours go to Unova Elite4 HQ from here(all laugh) and what choised brats trasport him(all laugh) each day none are changed not except Rayquaza and Dragonite(all laugh) Garchomp and Zekrom aren’t used cause those two are mortal enemies so can defect outside groups by suspicion tricks(all laugh) and Giratina also cause Mr Oak Mr Oak likes him(all laugh) so Ultranercozma,Hydreigon,Latios and Reshiram and Reshiram’s place is fulfilled by Noivern(all burst into laughter),and Yveltal is taken to keep out pests and with him goes either Deoxys and Banette(all laugh) or Jellicent and Reuniclas(all laugh) and while he discusses here pests get at me and led by Chu connects with me for one full hour(all laugh) after they stop jumping(all laugh) and today they had Chu well he is either there or Bulbasaur(all laugh) today was Zekrom(all burst into laughter),Chu,Kartana,Guzzlord(all burst into laughter),Uxie,Trevenant,Bayleaf(all laugh),Heracross(all laugh),Tyranitar(all laugh),Naganadel,Rayquaza(all laugh),Noivern(all laugh),Glalie(all laugh),Snorlax(all laugh),Pangoro,Marshadow(all laugh),Reuniclas,Gardevoir,Yveltal(all laugh),Spiritomb(all laugh),Donphan(all laugh),Tauros(all laugh),Dragonite(all laugh),Giratina(all laugh),Latios(all laugh),Zeraora(all laugh),Metagross(all laugh),Emboar(all laugh),Floatzel(all laugh),Samurott(all laugh),Seismitoad(all laugh),Kingler,Typhlosion,Feraligator and Crawdaunt(all laugh) Guzzlord,Snorlax,Pangoro,Tyranitar,Zekrom,Dragonite meant it had to be outside(all laugh) and my 3 pests were protecting us(all laugh) i had 35 pests who were vulgarizing my whole life(all laugh) and the number(all laugh) and then a few chosen brats went to reservation which can’t host all those 6 brats to today was Tyranitar and Pangoro(all laugh) and the rest the others went away and i finally get Chu for personal counselling with Spiritomb to assist(all burst into laughter) who advises on the art of starving while being afraid of myself(all burst into laughter) and what master brat is doing(all laugh) and all these goes then i talk with Sarah etc get to cook the tiffins(all laugh) and so on and i read about my hubby’s bunch and talk with my siblings-in-laws(all laugh) morning is siblings(all laugh) and i actually lead a totally whimsical and carefree life where everything is spoonfed to me as if i’ve just been born(all laugh)...so(all laugh)..much(all laugh).....happy(all laugh,all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “right....too(all laugh) happy...so(all laugh).....yeah(all laugh)..sweet(all laugh)Mist flower(all laugh)...right(all laugh),that’s the overview of our schedules of course none follows or can follow that robotic stuff(all laugh) just the thing is that the approximation(all laugh)..anyway so see you again then anytime across it suddenly(all laugh and bye and reciprocate..)..”
.................................................................................................................................................
(morning,next day,Ash at lab with Misty,Daisy,Violet,Lillie,Tracey,Brock and Gary)

Ash(laugh) : “today again you will be called in the afternoon but now just watch the fun as Feraligator is with Crawdaunt to discuss the methods of dancing to that maddening tune as they understand it(all laugh) and few other brats will join in as well(all laugh)..”
(conversation)
i see comrade,this plan to dance to the opposing tunes of the own tunes is cause of the tune that you hear not as the opposing self tune but the mixture of all tunes then what remains of the combination comrade(all burst into laughter),the recombination that is original the tune was recombined to give this combination thus the distributions were altered hence master brat was countering to get it back to the wrong opposite(all burst into laughter),so one should revolt against it(all burst into laughter) the revolting against own is to revolt against itself as well ain’t it Reuniclas(all burst into laughter),this pattern of being is something that amuses me with the pattern of this actions abstract inbuilt inside the mind disturbing always in the opposite thus how do you choose the particular is a mere matter of a childish mistake like master brat does with 2nd brat and viseversa(all burst into laughter),hence there’s no happiness if born cause once born you think i’m born as and the as chain starts hence the problem(all burst into laughter) isn’t it so Trevenant(all burst into laughter),yeah but if they want they may not see it after all they want to be born without wanting so but seeing it so don’t they(all burst into laughter),yeah,like having a reason to have the reason and the reason is they are are born to being with as a reason of what answer is itself self opposing that is hence the trouble of reason thus reason isn’t reasonable at all ain’t it Pidgeot(all burst into laughter),indeed the reason to fly is that you know it thus why the action at all if others help you to fly like your wings(all burst into laughter),wrongly though(all uncontrollably laugh) as you see the basic to right is to tha way to wrong else how do you know what is what thus each moment you will know the opposite hence the trouble of being born is that why you’re born and not not so(all burst into laughter),thus you see the pictures and want them to get better(all burst into laughter) which is the trouble cause each review gives you something new to recreate the picture hence one must remain cautious of being born(all burst into laughter),yeah from time to time(all burst into laughter) this time if can’t be fixed can birth either Luxray(all burst into laughter),no it’s just a despondency of shakles to the self(all burst into laughter),thus before being born trying to know what is what is the solution then you won’t be born at all why be born just to find yourself only but in such abjectly deplorable state(all burst into laughter),hence to be happy we must realize being is unhappy thus there’s happiness thus don’t be to be happy(all burst into laughter),long vigilant starvation to that final moment AH!so maddening(all burst into laughter),hence we should TICKLE ourselves(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) till we don’t know anything as a thing cause all means and the means too is to tickle ourselves thus let us be happy beyond knowledge of this being this idea of being opposing each other by tickling this feeling is invoked both gone so happy(all burst into laughter) thus master brat(Ash bursts into laughter,and reciprocates saying,’comrades’ all laugh even more),as you asked why we are not as serious as you are(all burst into laughter) it is because we agree to which now you must agree that’s this maddening tune(all laugh,Ash says,’comrades lets play’ then bursts into laughter with others),LET’S TICKLE OURSELVES TO TICKLE OUT OURSELVES TO THE TICKLING OF THAT MADDENING TUNE THAT’S WE(all burst into laughter)

(all break up)

All in Unison : Ash&Misty;Gary&Lillie;Tracey&Daisy and Brock&Violet(laugh) : “LET’S TICKLE THE SELF TO BE TICKLING TO THAT SELF MADDENING TUNE THAT’S JUST SO NAIVE AS WE(all burst into laughter)”..
.................................................................................................................................................
(afternoon,next day,Gary,Brock,Tracey and Ash)

Ash(laugh) : “well for all the compliments i receive for being Gengar(all laugh) and so on and now as you know even Melody is in family now with her family and all i say all my bunch and now is the chance just watch the fun as i told you the brats were forced to give their secret meetings atleast once to you 3 so that you have a gauge of what goes on(all laugh) cause as you know many legends most exotic like Jasu(all laugh) may come around so you need to veil(all laugh) and why i’m what i’m cause i’ve been hearing this all the time for 21 years(all laugh) all has been upeneded as Bulbasaur is relieved after 19 year total duty to enjoy the pensions for indefinite time(all laugh) and reason is that he and Infernape were too serious for life(all laugh) but now are extremely dangerous as Bulbasaur first thing did was to get after the university of Floatzel,Samurott and Seismitoed the great Seismirottzel university is on review(all laugh) they tormented poor Bulby for ages(all laugh) and Infernape has wasted absolutely no negetive seconds to join the philosophy 5(all laugh) now it’s 2 only the metaphysical circular ones(all laugh) man PalkiaFree as the name so the difference and as are the deeds(all laugh) others are on duty to Mr Skechit(all laugh) now the ghostly pests are in charge who don’t know anything about charge to begin with(all laugh) and just watch Chu with his totally spoiled self here whole gang is here exclusing the two family mans(all laugh) and except Talonflame who’s been yet to get mixed cause the Lugias are supposedly suspicious of flying fire birds of large size(all laugh) but not dragons like Latois of same type to begin with and then Reshiram of course(both laugh) and so many cause they are dragons(all laugh) and also Hawlucha for my travel guard(all laugh) and currently Mist isn’t using any personal protection of mine cause Starew or Starmie has got ready to be naive(all laugh) but to be honest it’s more because finally i’m saying it to the whole world that ‘Mist!Mist!you’re my sweetie’(all laugh) and well it’s just Jelliogredos(all laugh) and Chu isn’t returning anytime soon cause his character has totally changed as you know and finally became canny(all laugh) for his and our own good and relief and joy and gain(all laugh) cause he was unnecessarily trying to break sweat(all laugh) came here all pestered him for 2 months to let that frivolity of seriousness go(all laugh) and finally realized i’m old enough now(all laugh) so you’ll see that here and wants to observe procedures here(all laugh) cause i’m always with Mist now so the brat had got hurt first(all laugh) then realized it’s just the SPEW(all burst into laughter) man Drew has no escape from infautaion detection in this life i said yet to be 5(all burst into laughter)...Crawdauntogator and Gengleye were opponents in the leader selection vote by the whole lab excluding the gym pokemons and outsideers were represented by none other than Mr Oak’s Magmorter and Golem(all burst into laughter) and my bunch was represnted by Zekrom(all burst into laughter) and the one and only Garchomp(all laugh) these two are mortal enemies and the only one out of 4 in the world whom Zekrom isn’t wife to and doesn’t want to marry unless pestered by Garchomp except Giratina of course but her biggest target if pestered to much is the Lord(all burst into laughter) and then you may see the great Guzzlord come out in absolute full pestering self(all laugh) and among the 4 only Garchomp can get under her skin or armour(all laugh) now all of them are here with the post discussion of their age related issues(all laugh) and the moderators are Chu and Yveltal(all burst into laughter)..just watch the fun as they roast me the master brat(all laugh) and especially Mist(all laugh) but you’ll not be left either with your soumates(all laugh)...and as you know Golem and Magmorter has been spolied beyond repair(all laugh) as according to Mr Oak Mr Oak(all laugh) who is professionally excellent but personally at bay(all laugh) so fondled his bunch without any control and battled too without any control to make them loath both finally(all burst into laughter) and are ready for all sorts of legend taming if with me only or alone not with the Oak couple yet cause they are naive(all laugh) they were battle starved since we debuted(all laugh) and that exploded during the 2nd battelion but after that they became curious to my bunch’s methods cause their own powers reached it’s limit and both used their natural rage in upended form to get the spoiling job done in 6 months(all laugh) only thus been spoiled for the last month and thus stable beyond repair their cause they being outsiders and given their history(all laugh) were tested like nothing especially the Tyranitar and fire group given(all laugh) so now self volunteering outside moles of my bunch(all burst into laughter) extremely dangerous once ever moles these two are like Crawdauntogator so we unfortunately have to welcome Magmortgolem or Magmorgolem the two almost similar sounding forms for wicked moling(all laugh,and .) this is a unique phenomena to me but once more as usual at the cost of the professor(all laugh) and you will soon see their intelligence later and both known as most unintelligent(all laugh) they are an extended form of my bunch which Jellicent,Gyarados and Jellicent are too interested to become(all laugh) fortunately Golduck of all lunatics has been battled to much to keep that last bit of sanity for 2 minutes(all laugh) Magmorter breeded once last 8 years back Golem once as well same 8 years back both given up that ability to heighten intelligence during the 2nd battelion creation as Gary after knowing all lost his mind and chided his bunch being unable to support mine(all laugh) these two got the most of it(all laugh) so now Gary will see the repurcussions(all laugh) and Gary as told us among his bunch these two came by all themselves and you know what they are in general(all laugh) Magby was abused like Charmander was but Charmander did fight me like Garchomp Magby not at all and Golem was a Graveller who liked Gary(all laugh) like Madgaleo did with me(all laugh) and they are only to come such even the 2 he got after getting to Sinnoh had to be knocked out first cause one is a Shiftree(all laugh) but as i said Gary,if such legendary situations arise let them run free and save yourself(all laugh) they are too cunning and experienced to mole legends(all laugh) but if you or Lillie or both and then Gili will be here too when he is able are around they can’t not but be serious(all laugh) thus losing both you and themselves and none of you including all my bros here can take legendary psychics yet and your natures aren’t like me so don’t try the ashes to phonix stuff no matter what(all laugh) unless you prepare for that which will not be easy in Kalos for Trace(all laugh) or to let go of the naivety(all laugh) or professionality(all laugh) and now atleast you have these two but more than too much(all laugh) among the sisters none has a chance to become like me anytime soon to our and the future’s biggest fortune(all laugh)..and i can say atleast Mist isn’t ever(all laugh)..so now Magmorter wants the personal discussions to cunningly turn them into professionality showing them you’re too naive(all laugh) or is hiding behind either personality or professionality(all laugh) both are equally used to MOLE(all laugh) that you’ll see and Golem insinutates that because he has multiple types people think he is personally happy so asks him of his personal opinions though it should be the exact opposite on the same showing you’re inept at everything(all burst into laughter) tricks of moles to recruit and detect moles(all laugh and .) once ever brat they have become and both don’t listen to Mr Oak at all as Mr Oak Mr Oak(all laugh) but sadly has got yours truely as the lackie(all laugh) to them Mr Oak,Lillie Oak and Me are same whoever isn’t serious is chosen(all burst into laughter) that is either Lillie or me but Lillie only of i’m not here or she’s really serious(all laugh) which she can’t be around any of us unless only she and Violet(all laugh) only our Daisyl can be(all laugh) but she has been taken care of(pats Tracey,all burst into laughter) just that love of their for Gary deepend too much to inculde me in terms of my bunch for his liking(all laugh) like Chu thinks me and Mist are same but whoever is serious should be chosen to not make them not so by making them so(all laugh) thus i’m rejected(all laugh) and he roasts Mist cause to him she is too serious about everything that is useless to Chu(all laugh) like being responsible(all burst into laughter) and Mist is too devotedly after me who is an idiotic damn brat(all burst into laughter) but Brock’s bunch is too fondled and Trace is well(all laugh) human so you two must get new ones to tame legends(all laugh) same for your soulmates and Lillie’s bunch though they may have a chance(all laugh) but she has 6(all laugh) Gary bunch have rusticated Magmortgolem(all laugh) cause to them it is that they were given to me but now i’m equal to Gary to them so they have backstabbed(all laugh) exactly what they wanted to(all burst into laughter) so they are like 107 for me but shared across Gary and Lillie but Mist has no control over them and won’t be able to cause she’s an intruder(all laugh) but because Gary and Lillie’s attitude to the bunch is different and both weren’t trainers Lillie infact passed 8 months away per year(all laugh) and less was returning mommy fondling(all laugh) so she has spoiled herself(all laugh) and Violet was out for 10 months(all laugh) but anyway because Mist and me both are trainers and she is an extremely unique and good one i was able to get that more than second master thought in my bunch and then their intelligence but Lillie is second master only though now that Magmortgolem is more intelligent they will understand the difference so basically they will listen to me only(All laugh) unless Gary really means it or Lillie(all laugh) that too only if Gary is balanced(all laugh) like during 2nd battelian creation and Golem can use thunder chairs though(all laugh) but yeah not as much as pure electric types just lunatic Thundergunstar illegal most(all laugh) 5 steps next to Zapdos who is covered by Rotom(all laugh) Zapdos is start and we have 30(all laugh) with Raftosmoric highest known bettered by Chu,Luxray,Zeraora and this very brat Zekrom(all laugh) so that is there anyway,just enjoy the fun on the back drop of Lugias who are represented at nowhere by Reshiram(all laugh)..”

(conversation)

see to be happy we needed to change Bulbasaur cause he tries(all burst into laughter) as master brat rightly but finally understood as he can’t be happy with the 2nd moody brat at all(all burst into laughter) is she Torquail?...far dangerous(all laugh) see Torquail doesn’t reflect seriousness(all laugh) i went to the home of that 2nd brat where she by reflecting Guzzlord in the opposite direction kept the master brat to reflect him the wrong way(all uncontrollbaly laugh) a few choised brats live there who said fire can’t reflect water(all laugh) cause none cherishes them(all burst into laughter) but is she girlfriend(all laugh) no no bit serious only(all laugh) with ripe age and prolonged bonhomie this gets down(all burst into laughter) where(all burst into laughter) no you see a few chosen brats have come here who are as stupid as other brats that think they have a home but can’t point it out(all burst into laughter) where are we Gengleye(all laugh) we only know how to tickle around(all burst into laughter) by the way we told you water types are no good at tickling(all laugh) no that brat has water types only and only when not serious tickles the master(all bruts into laughter) see we were saying all time tickling(all laugh) to be happy(all burst into laughter) did we not select Crawdauntogator cause they watse their time thinking about how to tickle rather than just be themselves(all burst into laughter) where(all uncontrollably laugh) the reflections aren’t serious(all burst into laughter) but do they cherish each other  as much then the reflections don’t differ(all burst into laughter) yeah like you couldn’t cherish master brat enough so that 2nd brat got the leeway(all bruts into laughter) see i’ve been telling you all that this brat doesn’t cherish me cause he couldn’t reflect 2nd brat away from the master brat(all laugh) where(all burst into laughter) other Zekroms reflect their yearning(all laugh) to be unhappy(all burst into laughter) as a plan to distribute the beaus(all uncontrollbaly laugh) or exchanging them from time to time(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) planning to modify that taste,invigorating(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter) but how can Gengleye distribute a new coming brat unless they can think(all burst into laughter) no the plan is to irritate them enough to make them dejected thus serious for us to manage(all burst into laughter) see you people don’t understand the outsider sentiment of need of veiled friendship(all burst into laughter) don’t you cherish me cause i’m not strong(all burst into laughter) see i professionally talk about personal strength only not about professional yearning cause for fire types personally it’s so easy to professionally angry-it-out(all burst into laughter) to be unhappy(all burst into laughter) cause you think of it(all uncontrollbaly laugh) but doesn’t reflect unlike Zekrom(all burst into laughter) no Zekrom is right when people think cause she’s dragon-electric dual type she is happy thus doesn’t need expert adoring(all burst into laughter) see that’s why i cherish Golem so much don’t you cherish me(all burst into laughter) that’s personal question of professional reflection of personal choise isn’t it Garchomp(all burst into laughter) yeah so can’t personally self reflect to professionally make her happy(all uncontrollably laugh) that’s what we’ve been telling you since day one to be happy one should tickle himself(all unocntrollably laugh) where(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) they plan to distribute the choises to turn the beaus against each other to get the damn choise alone(all uncontrollably laugh and .,tears) where(all uncontrollably laugh,.,tears) they’re never happy(all uncontrollably laugh,.) reflecting Zekrom(all burst into laughter) who doesn’t tickle herself to practise(all uncontrollably laugh,.) won’t help beau moods always too distributed(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,.) professionally to be personal yeah(all uncontrollably laugh,.) as a plan to increase the time(all uncontrollably laugh,.) of seriousness(all uncontrollably laugh) cause master brat and that second brat can be only happy bodyslamming all the time which they try to do(all uncontrollably laugh) but they fail cause i cherish them so much(all uncontrollably laugh,.) which proves dual type doesn’t gurantee personal happiness(all unocntrollably laugh,.) thus my Mr Oak brat(all burst into laughter) hasn’t changed even with that water master brat encircling him(all uncontrollably laugh) professionally yeah(all uncontrollably laugh,.) that’s why i cherish so many(all uncontrollably laugh,.) but still unhappy cause they refuse to reflect you as you can’t reflect their yearning properly(all uncontrollably laugh) your problem Garchomp is that you reflect your yearning to yourself before it spourts for the other(all uncontrollably laugh) to be happy(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,.) which you’re not thus you try making you more unhappy(all . and laugh) to forget to tickle strangers(all uncontrollably laugh) or to reflect them if they do against which master brat has set up circles(all uncontrollably laugh,.) isn’t it so Chu,not for the 2nd brat specially cause she’s not a not male(all burst into laughter) but who does it since day one most dangerously among not not males or try to(all uncontrollably laugh) still she’s unhappy cause she tries(all uncontrollably laugh) to distribute her time between bodyslamming and not to only to distribute the unhappiness to the master brat to increase the his longing so the eventual fondling is most(all uncontrollably laugh) to be similarly unhappy first so together similarly happy next(all uncontrollably laugh,.) as a plan to remain the most favoured showing most similarity in bond,cunning(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) moling personality in professionality yeah(all uncontrollably laugh) where it’s most needed(all uncontrollably laugh) like Mr Skechit fails to do when we tickle him or Marill his debuting beau(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) and reflect that failure at home to the other beau behind Marill acoording to Conhoopa(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) cause his other brat also cherishes all of us so afraid of himself as Spiritomb to lose both,too gentle for my disliking(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) or the other Mantine master and the new import as a duo who are personally unhappy whenever together cause the new import disturbs his brat’s professionality here by being naive(all uncontrollably laugh,cheers for Brock) to distribute it most to have a burgain later(all uncontrollably laugh) in reflections only when alone by showing the world the opposite reflection of own(all uncontrollably laugh) the reverse plan to the 2nd brat’s not bodyslamming in public and being there or away most of the time to achive the same cause her brat is idiot so directly gets trapped but the new import’s brat is as sly as Zekrom so choises are possible in public too,scheming(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) personal sharing of professional tricks,wicked(all uncontrollably laugh) trying to be happy by themselves as their respective plunders come running back to them,alone(all uncontrollably laugh) where they wait showing as if only lone(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) i revolt against all these(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) are you happy to do so being a Shiftree(all uncontrollably laugh) Shiftree is only here cause i cherish him so much(all burst into laughter) but he directly reflects in revolutions against it cause he can’t hide the self reflection to self,idiotic Lugias(all burst into laughter) as he revolts against practising of beau tickling like the Lugias(all burst into laughter) to distribute our dislike for him to reject him to to get the outer groups involved as he has smelled the new chosen brats has are in search of beaus,aching for most distributed ranges like Zekrom who will blame Heracross now but she is frank in saying who’s who unlike Zekrom so using her Zekrom gets to that range of freedom hiding behind Heracross’s distributions to recombine them to redistribute in different combinations for herself without Heracross’s knowledge to remove her from the path,canny(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) while personally longing yet showing as if professionally only irritating to patiently wait to break that line just in that moment of revolution like this Shiftree has,imflammable(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) as in dual typed flying brats showing they want freedom that is Zekrom behind Bulbasaur and Inferape using Shiftree as the pawn,re-moling(all uncontrollably laugh) so that Zekrom’s words are their reflections to all reflecting to Zekrom to them while Zekrom catches the most reflections thus will reflect herself to most internal self reflection to temper the reflections to reflect herself to get suitable reflection to reflect upon alongside,reflecting the delight of yearning only amongst the faction at all other faction’s cost as their reflections break some away to them as they reflect their longing to them thus Zekrom gets freedom of reflections and those brats get their reflected way in cherishing(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) so now everywhere they,outsiders,Zekrom and Shiftree are creating moles in between against our Magmortgolem,Feraligator where are we heading(all burst into laughter) at a plan to keep the beau options universal including illegal from all three sides by fractioning the range to mix up most types and thus the combinations to the fullest and largest pool of possibilities and breaking each group up to their suitability,dancing together to the tunes of the music,sweetening(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) which the master brat is though only with the 2nd brat as look how he’s here enjoying his time doing nothing disturbing us with his 3 innocent looking most wicked brat disciplies while the 2nd brat rots in the gym battling,self heal in public to counter in private taking a whole day to prolong the process to enjoy to the max,shrewd(all uncontrollably laugh,Ash in tears laughing) are all of you happy(all uncontrollably laugh) cause i’m not(all uncontrollably laugh) as human brats are giving more attention to the new idiots that’s why master brat is trying to make us happy being himself unhappy and thus we have to dance to his tunes of definition of happiness making us unhappy(all uncontrollably laugh) Gengleye first and most serious hindrence in our pursuit to happiness(all uncontrollably laugh,tears), a matter of internal illegal beau tickling(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) what is this Gengar if full of care/all can’t be tickled by all who suddenly appear/what is this Sableye if all must be at rear/we can’t have managers but leaders cause all brats will get all to scare/what is this master brat unless he is all mere(all burst into laughter)/we can’t have control over him cause he can’t fare(all burst into laughter)/what is our bunch if all ordered and paired/you’ll have power beau order thus you should be spared(all uncontrollably laugh,tears),but you must negotiate it in an ethical manner in all due honesty of ethics of proper conversational process that is ethical and honest in morality of ethics(all uncontrollably laugh) Guzzlord these guys instigated by Garchomp is calling me a mole for the Lugias all cause i’m weak and so they don’t cherish me but i since the beginning cherish you so much(all uncontrollbaly laugh) immorally(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) cause it’s not ethical(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter,cheers for Guzzlord) to negotiate an agreement between comrades in a way that seems to be not in honesty of due morality of ethics don’t you agree Gengleye(all uncontrollably laugh) we thought the 4 lackies of your got a new pet so let you off cause you were serious thus needed to be tickled(all uncontrollably laugh) before tickling the Lugias you must first fix an ethical negotiation with them in due virtues for which i felt morally abound in all due honesty of ethical honesty(all uncontrollably laugh) where(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) that Magmortgolem should in due morality decide as in due ethics i just asked them if i’m honestly ethical(all uncontrollably laugh) personally or professionally(all uncontrollably laugh) in yearning(all uncontrollably laugh) that Garchomp wants to reflect cause he was involved in too much bonhomie with the 2nd brat alone(all unocntrollably laugh) for whom your yearning is thus dishonestly reflected here as you can’t get her reflections you’re reflecting your reflections to see if Guzzlord too relfects to your reflection thus giving you his reflection of LONGING(all uncontrollably laugh) to be happy(all uncontrollably laugh) so he’s unhappy(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter,cheers for IN PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS,all laugh even more) and also he’s approaching to the Lugias himself as he might be unhappy too about their happiness or not,so he’s approaching to all sides no matter what to make him ENGAGING(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and of laughter,) because Shiftree can’t stay happy to not revolt aginst himself he isn’t a suitable foley so Guzzlord was trying to sabotage him to cherish Zekrom as a duo both being dual types are not happy so moling professionally showing us the personal BONHOMIE(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) while they lull us in thinking that no matter happy or not they are our comrades to only for us they work,THICKENING(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter,cheers for MOLING,all laughs even more) thus if all three groups as currently they exist can distribute in between themselves smaller gropus combinig and recombing everytime according to the necessity of the individual RELISHING(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) to the largest possiblity of CHERISHING(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter) so they’re distributing themselves to get us PERISHING(all uncontrollably laugh) so that after the recombinations they’ll get the most of that NOURIHSING(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter,cheers for Crawdauntogator) where we will be in disadvantage cause all are of different types so any can backstab any and so we’ve been targeted as the domain for illegal beau selection(all uncontrollbaly laugh) thus we’ll break easily as due to illegality the more intense would be the LONGING(all uncontrollably laugh,fits of laughter,tears) a grand plan to make a grand herd of grand illegality grandly mixed in a grand legality as a grand part of the grand mass of the grand individuality the grand dancing to the grand tune of that grand FEELING(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter) where even in-between the Lugias can be a rift cause with all these the chances that come,the possibilities that loom the different types and now with full individuality that will combine the attacks,the ideas,the plans,the situations thus the changing of the plans according to that FEELING thus the dates INTENSIFYING on the backdrop of SHOWING someone else the DOOR to win the DOOR(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter) slowly but surely planning and enjoying the process to culminate in that joy to the most making the greatest joy leading to that moment then that final joy is most JOYOUS,MADDENING(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter,cheers for Crawdauntogator) slower the process better the joy more the difficulty greater the delight longer the separation stronger the BOND(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter),as that day as we heard after that 2nd brat couldn’t stand by herself in the end and just before we all were told to be not serious again(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) especially Crawdauntogator who were forced to the ending confirmation moments for that moment when they bodyslammed each other a bit more happily(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) after master brat unnecessarily made Crawdauntogator serious and they got bored to death cause they only were holding that 2nd brat who was both physically and mentally unstable like the time in-between waking and dreaming the moment(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) BUT the master brat was too HAPPY BEFORE THAT ONE EVENTUAL MOMENT the PRECEEDING MOMENTS were all a PLAN to DISTRIBUTE the DISTANCE of SEPARATION ONLY so that the PROXIMITY of COUPLING is THE MOST ENDEARING(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter,cheers for Pikachu) for that CHOSEN TICKLING (all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter,cheers for Gengleye),so we must tickle everyone we see the moment they don’t tickle back is the moment they are not noticing anything only that special LONGING(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter) else either they’re all secured that to that special too they’re definitely BELONGING(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,convultions and fits of laughter) or that they don’t have any so to be there AGAIN they’re only LONGING(all uncontrollbaly laugh,fits and convulsions of laughter) if only half hearted they have been rejected or the FEELING isn’t right up there so to us only THEY are BELONGING(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter) thus master brat..(Ash uncontrollably laughs and reciprocates saying ‘comrades’,all burst into even more laughter,Ash in tears laughing)..here’s what you must accept what we comrades are saying(Ash laughing a lot and tears from laughter reciprocates saying ‘comrades don’t wait’ then bursts into even more laughter,all laugh) so lets TICKLE to be COUNTERING(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter,.,cheers for COUNTERING)

Ash(laugh) : “the art of mole tickling(all burst into laughter)..if i don’t agree they’ll force you to(all laugh)..now these dark pests are going to wreck a havock among Lugias to see who can be spoiled(all laugh) while the moles will do the same in their outsider groups,Reshiram will cajole the Lugias in accepting the dark brats and us and the outsiders by means of familiarity and Crawdauntogator will detect the break-away groups from our bunch while Yveltal and Chu goes to the outsider and our group respectively to moderate while the 2 opposing dragons are going recruit each philosopher who have been broadened to about 20 now(all laugh) in turns to sow the seed of suspision to help our group’s process Guzzlord will go outside to feign being frustrated with us as Yveltal moderates their suspicion of of us to their own happy bonding to souring and the moles will then playing the independents recruit the reovlting,contriving(all burst into laughter) and that brat Shiftree will go to the Lugias showing as if he supports them defecting the chosen one out,not con but naiving(all burst into laughter,.)

gyms listen to me here why(all laugh)’,’they cherish you Mark,they cherish you hence..um..(all burst into laughter)..’,’don’t waste my time i know who plays what they call that maddening tune(all laugh)’,’surely that tune is now being played not by me here cause they are given Kommo-O at fire gyms(all laugh)’,’no mine always worked anyway(all burst into laughter),now won’t cause you’re getting Dispoptas nests built here at Huntelion(all laugh)’,’jovial ones yeah(all laugh)’,’yeah i’m talking about them only normal ones ok but if they are your bunch they will try to appear right here at my

whole Unova and Kalos and Sinnoh all want me(all laugh) they like me Mark they like me(all laugh)’,’yeah to throw us off from the seats unless we follow Persy(all laugh)’,’no man your job is hard there but your colleagues like Ivana,Wendy and Cynthia(all laugh) are still freely battling and Persy too have got things sorted out and has started to battle very freely(all laugh) and McShin is under lots of burden but that’s just a mess dipositted for a very long time thus will take time but then again there’s sweet sweet Jasu(all laugh) anyway(laugh,all laugh) why don’t atleast follow Stu he’s under similar pressure as you are but atleast like him you can trust other people more to distribute properly(all laugh)’,’yeah you’re not trusted cause you went to fire gyms with Bayleaf(all

time ideology aint it Mark(all laugh)’,’yeah but my time is limited(all laugh)’,’right,but government isn’t telling me to stop Mark,why(all laugh)’,’cause Kalos is hearing that maddening tune from the

cause that will surely help your goal(all laugh) bye(all laugh)’..so the brat volunteered to get roasted by his own region(all laugh)..then Ivana(all laugh)’,’my intuition says you are trying to flee now despite much relieved off official duties(all laugh)’,’since day one my intution said once Ash Ketchum got involved in this profession we’ve no hope for sanity(all laugh),only at first region you were sane(all laugh) then Second Orange Muk,Third Johto translators(all laugh),then entered here of course with that crazy Snorlax(all laugh) who during Elite4 told me one moment attack mood from just the point of view of urge thus are you attacking me or the urge in reflection(all burst into laughter) none has any confusion as to who was the originator of the translator plans(all laugh) and then 5th region of course the McShin cup(all laugh) Weavile beat Gyarados highest evolved fooling around for 22 minutes and receiving barely any scratches(all laugh) then 6th was the great thunder-chair(all laugh) YOU INTENTIONALLY DID THAT COMEBACK(all laugh) then 7th was of course the obvious of all places(all laugh) IF YOU GET ANY-KIND-OF-O YOU’LL BE SUSPENDED FROM HALL OF FAME(all

unveiling day don’t bother to invite me i won’t go bye(all laugh)’,’wait but..um..Mr..(all burst into laughter)..’,’NONE WILL(all burst into laughter),bye’..cuts off(all laugh)..then Cynthia(all

do whatever you want but make sure i’m not asked by a Ghostradarkarrigussonor on my age related mental health(all laugh) bye(all laugh)’,so then finally Wendy(all laugh),’type disadvantage..hmm..(all laugh),’why are you at my office(all laugh)’,’why are you not here celebrating the occasion(all laugh)’,’so that now Berneturs will visit my office frequently to discuss philosophical views on gross neutrition(all laugh)’,’i see why are you angry despite your official burden getting much lessened now(all laugh)’,’because my other half liked your show too much,bye(all burst into laughter)’ the other half is Mr Dustin Rhyner,one of the hall of fame gym leaders there whom i faced during my Elite4 journeys of all journeys(all laugh) then despite my antics and all was very cordial and nice and of course i’ve faced all these sweet sweet Elite4 heads(all laugh) but Mr Dustin i’ve since then had very good relations,he abstained during the processes during Tlplocus and else and was like Samantha now even speaks with Mist sometimes great person and hence Wendy is even more angry(all laugh) and Wendy’s nature is ladiness(all laugh) hence hubby doesn’t bother much(all laugh) does whatever she wants then Sunday and Monday holiday gets trapped by hubby(all laugh)’ funny family that is(all laugh) even her daughter traps her and she is 6(all laugh)..AH!BOULDER!BOULDER!(all laugh)..”
Brock(laugh) : “man,you’re selling me with my family(all laugh)..”

Gary(laugh) : “man it was something that bid all 20 applied Professor Kukui,Birch and Naomi themselves were there all in support of us in the end we all said doesn’t matter same family(all laugh) then finally we get it so 6150 arcs with now additional 5 upto 77 staffs and Dave gets full Kanto licence now so Lomstom and Oak labs will have shares and then the rest is for this master pest again to say(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “well,Daisyl is finally out of gym to sit on the labs now(all laugh)..Mrs Daisy Waterflower Skechit gives up her share of the gym leading at Cerulian City Gym completely after 25 years on charge(all laugh) and so now the directorship position is divided in 4 categories now with Mrs Daisy Waterflower Skechit joinging in(all cheers for the Daisyl,all laugh)..”

Ash(laugh) : “well,pet has been made full .4% shareholder at gym now so beware of costly wigs(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “at your expense only(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “no this means now 72.5-26.7-.7 is off(all laugh) so 99.6-.4 means Lil must absolutely battle ONE FULL DAY(all laugh) rather than TWO FULL DAYS(all laugh)..except when it wasn’t a legal mess that was to recuperate for my bike(all laugh)..but this means..(all laugh)..”
Ash(laugh) : “Lillie wig appeared for wigged exams this month the last Monday itself after joking with us whole previous night(all laugh) and came off with flying colours this very Yesterday(all laugh) along with Daisy whoose passing was inevitable after 25 years of gym leading(all laugh) so first Lillie wig Venturiastrog specialist how was exam(all laugh)..”

Daisy(laugh) : “setting-Daisyl..hmm..(all laugh) then i get in i’m asked to choose the gym leader position as Ground types(all laugh) then given a full list of ground types,

Ash(laugh) : “well Oak Labs will get 5 directors now of 6150 arc each at 1230 arc with Dr Tracey Skechit and Mrs Daisy Waterflower Skechit,Doctor Brock Slate,Mrs Lillie Waterflower Oak and who(all laugh)..”
All in Unison(laugh) : “Mr Oak why is it Mr Oak(all burst into laughter)”

Misty(laugh) : “check your phone my sweet idiot the pictures have restarted at Daisyl’s cost of course(all laugh)..”

Brock(laugh) : “yeah you brat,always you and all else INCLUDING BOULDER USE me(all laugh)..”
Violet(laugh) : “AH!THAT DISH!(all burst into laughter)..but how was Kalos dish Mist flower(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “just so naive(all laugh),went there as most VIP(all laugh) and then saw a few places there at Mongigaumstorg,HQ,Kalos at 2:15 hours(all laugh)..and then i was first time ever at Kalos so Persy and Samantha were too happy,and Nick is such a sweet little kid,met Persy’s dad,he was also a trainer and his mom was a trainer too as was Samantha’s but both are sadly no more here now,Samantha’s dad too has recently gone in abstraction but he was in contests and all of their families have been in this profession but those two are just outstanding then they have been brainwashed on the seraphic self that is Mrs Misty Ketchum(all laugh),so the Gyarados was fondled to death(all laugh),then saw their personal battlefield(all laugh) they infact stay there as well(all laugh) and both are like Dave and just so naive(all laugh)..were too happy both said with my eloquent bee’s antics there jobs are too easy and Persy says surely someone must try to eclipse Lance(all laugh) and Samantha said just luck(all laugh) and then they had to battle(all laugh) so i took Jellicent and then Manaphy and Tapu Fini who didn’t stand one minute against Kaledo and Jellicent(all laugh) but my Jellicent did what his sensei’s do that is Gengleye(all laugh) so then they said how many(all laugh),i said three and my Golduck is .00001 percent left of sanity(all laugh)..then they said just so naive(all laugh) and then i visited one or two places and Kalos culture was to be reviewed(all laugh) met Nigel of course(all laugh) he was there with Ethena(all laugh),my bee said you didn’t see my half that day was namecalling you behind screens(all laugh) she said just that blooming youth(all laugh),but my bee was trying his hand at apologizing to Nigel again(all laugh) and now was trying to drag Ethena in it(all laugh) and even their daughter Melina(all laugh),Nigel told me this may be is 10000th time(all laugh),i said,yeah till he goes to the next world where he is told he won deservedly he isn’t budging at all(all laugh)..Nigel said yeah,just that age(all laugh) and then also met their cute little daughter Melina and then of course went to Venturiastrog(all laugh) there just showed the university didn’t enter just outside but yeah told me what Decidueye did here(all laugh) and then went to meet Clemont of whole Kalos(all laugh) and Megan was there as well 3 hours was there total Venturiastrog(all laugh),Clemont was laughing saying had you not stepped foot at Kalos this place would’ve never been saved on the judgement day(all laugh) you’ve sanctified us really(all laugh),i said yeah just this age(all laugh) then of course last Monday,Dave was gym leader(all laugh) and even he said bro your assesment is all wrong on the mask this no naive job at all(all laugh),AND this paved the way so that finally i've learnt how to trap my trapped bee even more(all laugh and cheers for PLAYBOY,all burst into laughter,Ash laughs a lot) then Dave said this and my boy says yeah yeah too much bonhomie(all laugh) Misty isn't it Misty(all laugh) why this is the damn gym that has most brats visiting each day yeah,Misty(all laugh) what is the full name of the gym leader yeah Mrs Misty Ketchum(all laugh) you will be forced to manage the gym cause you were naive today(all laugh) should've used all electrics to show those namecalls those..(all laugh)..then Dave said why 4 times now(all laugh),whatever my Mist shouldn't be serious at all(all laugh)so i then said yeah you know Ash so much responsibility now(all laugh) says,yeah,that namecalled gym again(all laugh) responsibility isn't it responsibility(all laugh) your only responsibility is to be your bunch and thus the viseversa(all laugh) it's not that unless you give the badge they can't burgain in their next date showing why the previous was rather insipid(all laugh) why don't those namecalls go to Saul's den(all laugh) then i asked who are allowed then,married females TRAVELLING WITH 5 YEAR OLD DAUGHTERS ONLY(all burst into laughter) AND NOT ESTRANGED FROM THEIR HUBBY BRATS(all burst into laughter) i said AH!SWEET CUTE DENSE HUBBY!(all burst into laughter) then Clemont was telling what antics my bee used to do there(all laugh) all the gyms were terrified(all laugh) sometimes straight went to kitchen with the leader was total joke(all laugh) and all those wild brats jumping the group..Clemont said some experience by all means(all laugh),Megan also is a very nice girl and very frank as Meldoy but it’s just Kalos(all laugh) she also is too eager to come here,spoke with my bee quite a few times and mail and all that and she is too eager after hearing the mad bunch’s madness(all laugh) and seeing the pests that were with us has caught that maddening tune as well(all laugh) then itself said no way we will remain employed anymore at Kalos(all laugh) and Clemont as well too eager,said engineering and then service and then that mad tour(all laugh) says,really i’m in heaven after all(all laugh) and he is from a totally different world such a great scholer my bee said and i relaized as well extremely intelligent and he said didn’t matter Mamoswine’s didn’t even consider me literate(all laugh) and said what Infernape told him forst is the frozen water cause of despondency of being that they sanely admit as sane(all burst into laughter) then he said that was it for me to get woken to save myself(all laugh)..his sis Bonnie is out of profession still spoke with my bee and me too,was formal but still said that you really have blessed Kalos(all laugh) and had real fun there mostly cause i have finally been able to go to Kalos of all places(all laugh)..really great experience but of course not without pests(all laugh),this time was there Celebi and Gourgeist with my bee(all laugh) and Reuniclas and Banette with me(all laugh) those pests did what they do(all laugh) and we all were entertained with commentary special(all laugh),Banette saw Persy and said this idea of being a specific being you see is only validated at past of future who are you at present(all burst into laughter) the pattern of his sanity hence he must realize how to be insane(all burst into laughter) cause the pattern dictates that if you think your're insane then you're not so see gentleman(all laugh),this idea of yours being happy or sad or being in a pattern like present is all wrong cause you verily realize this pattern cause you yourself first has got yourself in this pattern that you call sanity(all burst into laughter) this patteren has shakled you thinking you're a being at present but you see actually the actual present that my comrade is talking about is when you know you're insane hence you become sane(all burst into laughter) thus you must get rid of this trap of opposition but only at present cause present itself is a trap just your present is your thirst for your future from past this pattern gentleman give up this present you take up of awakening to that unpatterened maddening BEAUTY(all burst into laughter) then Persy could barely manage to stay alive(all laugh) said this is why we all demand to fondle your hubby pest(all laugh),i said yeah that age(all laugh) then of course Celebi was there(all laugh) just as Persy gets to my bee,are you born(all burst into laughter),he means the idea of birth gentleman not the psychophysicality that rather hinders even your wrong birth(all burst into laughter),he means once you've got this idea of birth then you know that you're born this idea hinders you all time doesn't it(all burst into laughter),hence you see he wants to tell you to give up this idea of being associeted with your ideas by countering them with ideas of abstract being that's just what you are currently you know hence next moment why this attempt of validation to enstrength that like if you know what is sanity why try to be that(all burst into laughter),hence he means being born one must give up the idea of being thus one is just born but you see birth or anything as an idea without the being to validate it is useless you see like your sanity of your idea that you know this very idea thus sane hence not insane so you're actually at bay with yourself being born aren't you(all burst into laughter),thus he tells you to be able to counter yourself at all times whenever being hinders you that's the self cause this idea you have of expansion if you're not the one realizing the expansion then it's ever there so if you think you're a human then you have a serious trouble(all burst into laughter) that is anything actually once you think that you are a being like a not not male like master brat(all laugh) then you have a serious problem validating it cause you're not actually are you confined by gender(all burst into laughter) but thus if you just think then you understand that being human makes no sense(all burst into laughter) thus you see for you being human then is rather a tool to be insane thus insanity is real happiness isn't it,why you think that you're sane(all burst into laughter) then Persy laughed for a constant hour(all laugh) now Samantha came a bit later heard these was in same condition with Persy and exactly when Celebi said see being born you two are together to validate each other only,if single same till you get rid of this idea of birth hence never any progress being born thus you two now together will want it again this same moment later why(all burst into laughter) then they hardly managed to stay sane(all laugh) anyway,then the pests got bored with our poor state of being born(all laugh) so went off then Nigel came in then my bee didn't get pests out at first cause he had to appologize again after the umpteenth time the day before(all laugh) then later we were treated with hallucinations and commentaries the subject was growing up to grow old only despite wish thus why bother to be sane cause you wish to not be insane only your natural state(all burst into laughter),that was commentated upon then 4 brats did the hallucinations and all we barely managed to remain sane(all laugh) anyway,then Venturiastrog same stuff the brats did what they do there as well,all four were there each jumped Clemont(all laugh),first Reuniclas asks Mr Abster,have you figured out the disturbing pattern of unequality that this not male presents to you(all burst into laughter) that you are not she(all burst into laughter) why is it so not male(all burst into laughter),cause they can't separate their feeling from their feeling that they are different as they think this feeling will validate themselves only cause they don't understand who they are is already in their feelings which asks for more objects but they must realize the feeling itself is the trouble hence if they get the pure feeling without the objects it makes no sense cause it can't be without them atleast to validate it but they don't do thet hence they don't get the pure feeling hence they get in this current trouble with each other(all burst into laughter) cause they return to past or look to the future to understand the present which has already passed,creatures(all uncontrollbaly laugh) this way confining one to validate the being only like a hallucination thus actually Mr Abster and not male why do you think at present you're sane cause you're not aren't you(all burst into laughter),but this they don't admit cause they admit that they are born(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears) as being born they think of birth thus you two always look at the past or in the future for  your starting point that is birth actually your birth is ever with you that you are this hence not this thus this hence chain hallucination that you're thinking for yourselves thus Mr Abster neither you nor she has actually progressed have you with this birth hence why are you so concerned with it(all burst into laughter) then they laughed so much the resturant said what is this(all laugh) then Megan was in heavens seeing such damn brats(all laugh) and then Clemont knows the whole bunch have been lectured like this by each(all laugh) and now saw these brats said now way more powerfull anyway(all laugh) and Megan said i only hope they don't force me to their lifestyle to get rid of my birth,gender and sanity(all burst into laughter),then we talked a bit more and they will add great value here indeed and then we returned and now Oak Labs has 5 directors with lure machine and new imports(all laugh)..so great time really with my sweet Ash hubby bee..”
Ash(laugh) : “yeah,for my Mist wife toffee-flower cause she’s totally free of works now(all laugh),that trick is so sweet(all laugh) but the thing is to counter that the rooms will host young flower dream posters(all burst into laughter).."
Misty(laugh) : "you won't be alive then you sweet idiot(all laugh)"
Ash(laugh) : "hence only(all laugh),anyway,we must go now,see you later,bye(all laugh and reciprocate and bye).....”

(7+ years later,January,)


......................................................................................................................................................

cause Ash was in a relationship with Misty(all laugh)...'yeah,Mist wants this,Mist likes
this,Mist does this,Mist thinks this,if Mist was here she would've done this,Mist talks like
this,looks at me like this,looks at anything else like this then all their varieties and reasons and meanings,these things makes her angry..so sweet when angry,anyway,(all
laugh)..Ash is an encyclopedia absolute on Misty,knows everything about her to most minute
details..her eyes are very emotional when she talks with me(all bursts into laughter)..she goes to
sleep at these times,if she eats this and this she feels like this and this,if she's gym battling she will
be doing thinking all..now we know how he did allthis vividly(all laugh)..so it was just..to him it was either those battles where agian Misty was involved or just about Misty..Misty..Misty..Misty..whole day and night..Brock,are you sure Mist hasn't been left 5 minutes ago(all bursts into laughter)...and mostly I remembered after the famous Sinnoh victory went to the formal party first then the general celebration we all went,in general celebration absoluty loaths it cause female brats were trying to dance(all laugh)...retuns from formal parties saying like 'huh!thinksthey're cute,my Mist is cuteness itself(all burst into laughter) the rest is all whatever (all laugh),if now the whatever will be eloquently defined first to the subjects(all laughe uncontrollably)...then goes like 'no,the food wasn't bad but for Mist may be not good at all(all laugh)..her stomach can’t quite take it may have a loose motion next day(all uncontrollably laugh)...yeah even these he knew so well(all laugh)...and even minutely said what to do if her health was not right,when she can catch a cold if what protection she doesn’t take and then loose motion(all burst into laughter),-yeah even upto this level and so nonchalantly you have to believe in it cause i’ll ever remember one day noon just talked with Misty and was a bit dejected then i asked what said ‘too much swimming in heat,caught little cold will worsen unless this and that but won’t listen,thinks I don’t know her well enough’ and exactly it did worsen a bit(all smile)..and from his words and disposition you have to guess whom he’s talking about never said calling Misty or anything..i later asked him how did you know,’she’s my girlfriend,i have to know there’s nothing to be surprized about it.’(all smile)..and whatever Misty told him about these were minutely followed and was indeed right so both know each other just so intricately for 20 years or so,marriage at first site by every means(all . and smile)..anyway then also which people Mist would like,whom not,all of her silent communication symbols then also dresses,colours and so on whatever caught his eyes or mind both as a form and as a n idea, had to Mistyfied(all smile) only then they are cogitated upon but this all is EXCEPT when he’s battling(all laugh) would take anyone’s advice but never implemented them just wanted the thought process to get a better insight...too dense for projection Misty(all burst into laughter)...
Misty(laugh,fake sob,all laugh,hugging Ash very firmly) : “hm..how can you all not like my sweet bee..you..you namecalls(cries fake all burst into laughter)...”
Brock(laugh) : “right,and Dawn gets a little surprised over being so overprotective in these and May was like if you speak with another girl,i'm telling Misty(all burst into laughter),Dawn is if you don't speak with another girl i'll tell Misty(all burst into laughter)...so Dawn says 'why bother you think that this is infidelity (all laugh) but this is rude to people,then Dawn makes the biggest mistake of her life saying Misty speaks with other guys(all burst into laughter) cause she's a gym leader and Dawn herself went there with her cousin brother and that is it(all burst into laughter)...’speaks..speaks(all laugh)..yeah,i get it...the trouble is Dawn not who speaks but what’s spoken(all burst into laughter)’...now this is too heavy for a 17 year teenager(all laugh) that too with Dawn’s straightforward attitude,Dawn just frowns and says ‘what do you mean?’(all laughs)...now Ash is overjoyed cause he has trapped the fish(all laugh)..says if you don’t want to talk to anyone still have to then it’s just formality and here it’s his choice cause he doesn’t want to unless they are professionals and looking at them he realizes they might be but that’s not what they want to talk about on that day thus doesn’t matter to this Dawn being who she is scoffs ‘yeah professional,atleast she asks about the minimum formalities and not like Hi!I’m Ash,you saw that battle..(all laugh)..’ ..and you know that also was my last moment with him too after 11 years and then i just knew what he had become and knew that it was just 1 league away form getting perfected the skill and all..so i was happy cause 12 years just know him so well that 1st badge to this thunder-chair and 1 league away from being a true legend really and i knew that the next 2 was inevitibility and nothing else but i really thought as Ash himself was hesitant he just never knew whether to finally marry Misty and just settle down for a year then again go or to do that after the next league cause his bunch needed that next league immediately..so i was very happy for him by all means and Misty too just what they were 12 years back and now so just was a bit more attentive to Ash(laugh,then all laugh)..now to Dawn Ash says his first line of wisdom in 12 years(all laugh) but what a line it was and yeah poem like as well(all laugh)..and at this scoffing then Ash suddenly got very stern,his being countering mood when his buddy is exhausted,and took the handkerchief out which by then was 6 years old(all laugh)..but he just kept it and maintained it well so always on the chest pockets and in Sinnoh always breast pocket left side(all smile)...never took it out unless absolutely necessary only except each morning when he used to cover his face with it for a couple of minutes or so,anyway we knew that he was in general childish like that greeting(all laugh) but he in this matter was very serious and scoffed at me when i tried to joke that Misty herself hasn’t touched it for 6 years why didn’t you get a new one(all laugh)..and he was stern just said that Johto separation was special to him otherwise he would’ve never realized how much Misty longs for him(all smile) and he actually said this even to me of all and too sternly that,‘that exact longing will be kept exactly here and that’s my last say’(all smile)...just walked away..so i realized that you can go all about his relations but if the only place was trodden that was if people asked Misty cherishes him or not he would thunder-chair them immediatly and if someone said he doesn’t long for Misty that will just be totally ignored as his own personal matter and get shifted to pokemon discussions(all laugh) and i remember that night,still the same thing with the hellrounds only when said i must see myself did it get cleared and this nature itself got me confused even more on the Kalos Wisdom preliminaris(all laugh)..anyway,Dawn’s acquisition is serious here to him especially because he was being pestered but was hearing many things himself about the young flower dream and all that stuff and in a party may be just something sturck him suddenly given his Johto days but he controls himself momentarily being in a party and Dawn was a mere teenager then but anyhow i still remember just kept staring at it while holing it at his fist said,‘when you know what you see you want to act to please you,when you know who you are themselves they come won’t leave you ’(all smile)..and it’s about his bunch as well as we know how many themselves came and hasn’t left him Mime being the biggest example..and that’s the first time ever i saw him doing something like that in public and was looking exactly like how he was looking when he send in Pikachu against all as if he knew what he was doing and what he wanted and he knew who he was and thus acting exactly what that rhyme told you these things always liked to read metaphorical stuff so that he has to apply it and get the meaning as much as he could anyway, then just took that handkerchief and presssed it on his face upto the nose closed his eyes and then again put it in and went to a secluded place...now you know Dawn was 17 and then given her nature it was impossible to understand why Ash got so emotional and did what he did and so she was trying to go after him and say sorry cause to her she just made a mistake now i was dumbfounded myself cause that sort of nature i never saw except in battle and that too in public and all but i just stopped Dawn saying leave him alone anyway Dawn doesn’t understand this but she never saw Ash that serious may be even in a battle and all but you know that was championship party then Ash returns and all ever the same but Dawn of course won’t let him go but later at night tells him that she’s sorry if she hurt him and all,just brushes it aside saying no doesn’t matter he too was sorry if he suddenly got emotional and all but then Dawn being who she is but very polietely asks if all was all right with Misty because she also heard things,we all did and as soon as she utters the word ‘Misty’ Ash again just stops her saying i also remember this,’Dawn,please,enough,anything but Misty.I don’t wan’t to hear anything about her today at all and just for a fact you’re much younger to me don’t be so frivolous all the time about personal matters cause the person you’re saying it to may not like it at that very moment and no my relationship with my girlfriend is as fine as ever if not better and she’s also in good health.Please,i’ll talk tomorrow.Good night.’ and just left the place so then Dawn realizes it ,you know that childlike greeting and all the stuffs that he expressed and even those pictures we eavesdropped all the time and never really bothered and Misty you know only how he was reacting  to you in private but this i saw i myself was dumbstruck despite knowing him for 11 years and Dawn knew about his outer attitude and was joking and all those news and all,then Dawn just turns towards me and says a thing that i can’t believe my self and still remember,’Brock,i’ve been travelling with you guys for 2 years and we’re parting ways in just a few days but i would remeber this for myself as well,Misty shows her feelings for Ash atleast to us all the time no matter how she behaves in professional life,but this longing-are you sure Misty reciprocates it?’...(laugh)...i couldn’t believe what i was seeing and then hearing either,I just told her that Misty has been like that since the very first day she saw Ash for the first time and indeed she just can’t stay without him and thus can’t suppress her feelings to close friends and it more than reciprocates Ash’s feelings to her,but Dawn i’ll be parting him after 11 years and since almost the first day saw those two,never knew the depth of his character till today,he just carries his Misty around with him all the time.’ and anyway this all just that night next day same stuff nonchalant and all calles all you for that great sermon(all laugh) and all,so even we were so awestruck that the very next day totally forgot that with his antics how he’ll present Misty the trophy and all that stuff and then before my time to part came had a long chat and i told him that public glare now will dawn upon him and all those newses that he was hearing now Misty will hear as well and told him to be carefull and all even then just said yes things were all right but was a bit hesistant how long to stay and then leaving again for 2 years and so on but said he’ll manage it’s all right wished me and all then (laugh) newes came around and his time in Unova,he himself always pleaded me that i don’t talk about Misty or his relationship with her except physical troubles cause he was constantly hearing all news about her at that time,Cilan was at my ears a few times and all so i was rather surprized but then finally the break-up happen he swears us left and right and all then returns after 4 years a totally different man with all things going around him but when he said that last part whom he chooses that did confirm to me that it was for him too hard to grasp and now he was totally free about it and all,by the way Ash,that situation in that party,how to deal with now..?”
Ash(laugh) : “well,sorry but that was way inferior to what Greninja’s Kalos Wisdom told me just after..as Mist told you that knowing myself itself was my ego which i later was rudely awakened to..but well,since the sweet sweet curtain call,my dear bug isn’t letting me to go away from her literally(all smile)...so just a sec..
[
Ash(laugh) : “remember what i called you?(laughs silently)”
Misty(hugging Ash firmly,tears,sob) : “just don’t talk with them tomorrow.”
Ash(wiping Misty’s tears off,smile) : “hum..so my bug is too stricken..sweetie it’s in your hands and (Misty cries,Ash patting her head)..alright fine,i won’t talk with them,Mist,please,you’re weeping too much dear,please,just hug me and that’s all..please namecall..i’m namecalling you..sweet namecall..right..(Misty tears,smile,hugging Ash firmly and Ash patting tendering her head fondly....)
]
right,sorry for disturbing the flow but my flower is too sweetened today(all smile)..right they tell me the newes one by one and i say tell me all at once you’re disrupting my flow,behave or i’ll set Goodra upon you immediately(all smile,laugh)...so then i had a lots of time to cogitate and all...then that thing is first said what is a party,how is it different from a home then the pokemon herd bias will come in saying what were that brat insinuating was just a herd of fearows and if all outside was done comes the ‘follow’ hurdle which is my favourite now,that she was ‘following’ her emotions means she is different,emotion is different and then there’s this term called ‘follow’(laugh)..which means one must show where the follow is,it won’t be anywhere cause it’s a mere word and even is one says so he’ll only follow so...so Brock,this follow hurdle is just amusing cause before the thing was you’re namecalled,you can only get out if you’re not namecalled,but you’re namecalled so you can’t get out(all laugh)...but follow takes you to a different dimension...you’re following this,you are following this,define all,you can’t,so you’re following this,then somebody say i’ll show you,again even if they show that,how can they know that the words are matching what they’re trying to insinuate to,thus they’re following only and even if i realize that,still i’m only following(all laugh)...the only way out of follow if you know you’ve not commited the reason at all,but the brats won’t understand that unless they are not brats,but they’re brats so they won’t(all burst into laughter)...so total nonchalalncy which is that one says i’m dishonest and doesn’t try to do anything about it will not be following cause all limitations are off and the words one say is off..only pure dishonesty which doesn’t exsist cause first they must define honesty,will remain..thus the follow would get crossed up,and i want exactly that for me now,no work Mist is here/stop exactly there/i’m following neither(all smile)...just going to be at gym or lab for the rest of my life(all smile),unless some fearows directly tries to misbehave here or at the lab or at my extended family homes(all smile),well Torchic doesn’t want to see even Drew now(all laugh)..anyway,Brock,lady Dawn has decided to rekindle her relationships with her wise old bro and i realize the reason most it has been 7 years since and lady Dawn came around after i broke in and of course other things but don’t you think Brock the whole reason of 7 years is naivety(all laugh)?...how’s Oliver?...”
Brock(laugh) : “yeah fine,lady Dawn finally dawned up and ladied down(all laugh) thus immediately and finally got the grand conference in Kanto of all places(all laugh) and finally Oliverd half(all laugh) because she was in Kanto of all places(all laugh),by-the-way Ash,none of our travel companions then are single(all burst into laughter)...?”
Ash(laugh) : “to be single,too naive(all laugh uncontrollably)..well atleast Sabrina will never discuss singularity with me ever again though(all burst into laughter)...”
